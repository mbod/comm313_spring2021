    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this analysis I will attempt to better understand the nature of the <i>Internet Research Agency's</i> (IRA) disinformation campaign during the 2016 campaign cycle.  More specifically, I am interested in the linguistic mechanisms, frequency, and targeting strategies of the group.  Throughout this period, the topic of \"disinformation\" dominated the discussions in both the media news cycles and at the highest levels of government.  My goal is to dissect and discover whether the group was as \"effective\" as claimed.  In order to assess this, I describe effectiveness as being equivalent to how polarizing the group's messaging was.  It is quite clear that the intention of the Russian government and associated proxies was to divide the American public by catering their messaging to instill division within vulnerable groups, themes, and events.  I argue that the IRA's central focus was supporting the political \"Right\" in America through clear and divisive language, timing, and structure. I also would like to make it clear that the extent of the Russian government's disinformation strategies were not solely limited to Twitter; they took place across many social media platforms.  Additionally, the sample of Tweets that I have collected are thanks to the tireless effort of Clemson University Professors <b>Darren Linvill</b> and <b>Patrick Warren</b>.  Their methodology for tagging and collecting these Tweets is available at https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-tweets. In addition to this data, I also scraped over a thousand Tweets using Tweepy, specifically looking for Charlottesville Rally content in the week before and after August 12, 2017. <br/>\n",

    "To begin my analysis, I think it would be appropriate to provide a macro view of the issue as a whole.  The true dimensions of the IRA Twitter disinformation campaign are <b>STAGGERING</b> in size and impossible to fully catalog.  For instance, the Clemson University professors gathered close to <b>3 million</b> Tweets.  For computational purposes/to prevent my laptop from melting, I have a much smaller sample of <b>243,891</b> Tweets. <br/> <br/>Within this subset, there are numerous variables including, but not limited to:<br/>\n",

    "I think it is important to establish a basic time line to demonstrate the amount of planning that went into the IRA's effort.  It also serves to illustrate how responsive these campaigns were to current events.  In the figure below I added labels to provide historical context.  The data represents the dispersion of all IRA Tweets across all IRA accounts by day starting in late 2014 until early 2018.  One of the most remarkable findings was, by far, the number of Tweets posted during the Charlottesville Rally.  The attention paid to this event by traditional news outlet's and social media was incredible, so it makes sense why the IRA  hijacked the emotional frenzy for malicious purposes. I will go more into depth as to what exactly happened during this tragedy.  Interestingly, one would have thought the 2016 election itself would have resulted in the largest quantity of IRA Tweets. I found it useful to use Plotly because it allows the user to inspect time periods of interest, especially given the longevity of the campaign."

    "Additionally, I thought it was important to zoom in even more by examining the timeline by day. A significant portion of disinformation campaigns conducted by the Russian government involved what are called \"sockpuppet\" accounts, or bots that are automated to send specially crafted content. Some reports demonstrate this through heat maps of Twitter postings by correlating the frequency of postings to a specific time.  If there is a sudden flurry, at say 2:00 PM, it is likely that a machine was programmed to execute this task.

Given more time and resources, it would be interesting to attempt this process on the entire sample. This is the first clear instance of using potentially polarizing terms, such as <i>\"antifa\", \"truth\", \"trump\"</i>, and <i>\"response\"</i>.

By selecting a date range before and after the aftermath of the rally, I hoped to grab a more nuanced slice of the Twitter chatter. I placed these Tweets directly scraped from Twitter first in the keyness analysis due to the frequent presence of Russian characters and other less manageable tokens in the IRA sample. The <i>Freq.Keyness</i> column is a measure of the log likelihood of the given term in comparing the two corpora. "

In the case of \"<i>antifa</i>\", \"<i>patriot</i>\" or \"<i>barbmuenchen</i>\"* etc, there are more clearly divisive terms that stand out.  As a step further, the language used far more frequently in the IRA sample suggests an almost galvanizing tone as highlighted by terms such as \"<i>join</i>\", \"<i>us</i>\", or \"<i>army</i>\".  This would confirm many reports that there were events and rallies  organized by Russian operatives to further polarize and energize the public (United States, 25).

    "A crucial ingredient in a successful disinformation campaign is emotional fervor.  In other words, creating content that polarizes people likely relies on prompting a human, emotional response. An important part of the social media echo chamber effect relies on the principle of \"homophily\", or the tendency of humans to relay content shared by their friends on a given social media site (M. De Choudhury).  IRA efforts to expand their reach were clearly successful, so in this section I analyzed the emotional content of the Tweets. Also known as Sentiment Analysis, there are various methods to score language. I used both a macro and micro approach, once again, in evaluating the emotional content of IRA tweets.  After feeding all the IRA tweets for the Charlottesville Rally filter through a Sentiment Analyzer, we got these two scores:"

    "The first score (-0.20) represents the mean composite score of all the IRA Tweets (remember, we filtered by Charlottesville rally content), and the second score (-0.08) is the general corpus of Tweets scraped directly from Twitter that specifically mention the Charlottesville Rally.  A score of 1 is perfectly positive.  A score of -1 is perfectly negative.  Overall it would seem that the majority of Tweets posted tended toward the negative side.  Interestingly, IRA Tweets tended to possess slightly more negative content.  The difference between both corpora does not appear to be all that significant, suggesting that the IRA was able to seamlessly fit into the Twitter narrative frenzy.  In order to confirm this, we need to be targeted with our emotional analysis.  Using a more sophisticated method, we can estimate the sentiment of these Tweet using VAD scores for each Tweet in each corpus.

Even if the information wasn't false, by harnessing the echo chamber effect of Twitter, the IRA could accomplish its task.  Put more succinctly, by adding to the noise, it only helped the IRA's chances.

My project dealt with a large quantity of data and at times was difficult to sort through to find trends or anything of note. Looking into the future, it is likely that there will be more disinformation spreading attempts.  Additionally, as the quality of the content improves, it will likely become more difficult to trace to a foreign nation state.  This will be an incredibly difficult task that both the public and private sector will need to tackle."
