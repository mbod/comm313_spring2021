Finishing it has left such an empty void in me and I can’t help but make comparisons with any other dramas I watch.\\n\\nThis drama is such a unique case for me because usually I only have interest in Korean dramas and have struggled to enjoy a Chinese drama despite been Chinese myself. I also generally dislike dramas where the female chases after the male. However this drama has a special charm that I am unable to resist, making it probably even my most favourite drama ever in my 4 years of watching Asian dramas.\\n\\nMany people may think of Xiaoxi as a dumb bimbo whose life revolves around a guy and while this may be true we must remember that she is a high school girl and at the time where the desire for romance is very strong.\\xa0She makes mistakes and is most definitely not perfect.\\xa0As the drama progresses, we begin to see her development into an independent lady that is not as easily swayed by Jiangchen until she is treated right. Also she too has her own hobbies and aspirations that do not revolve around Jiangchen which is something that is not commonly shown in dramas with similar themes. No she does not become a nurse for Jiangchen.\\n\\nNONE of the character are perfect. Not even the seemingly perfect Jiangchen whose jealously often gets the better of him and also has his own insecurities just like the next person. \\xa0This makes the drama even more likeable and relatable. They all make mistakes and all learn from it.\\xa0\\n\\nThe drama is a perfect example of taking a very cliche and used plot and twisting it into a unique and charming drama that will remain in our hearts for a very very long time.',\n",

It started because Jiang Chen started to show he liked Xiaoxi and would do little things to show that he was interested. I also liked the second lead Bu Wongsu and how he tried his best, but I especially loved how Jiang Chen would feel jealous and threatened by him.\\n\\nBut Xiaoxi is such a nothing, whiny, submissive, pathetic character!\\n\\nA lot of the series is spent on school life, but because it was hard to connect to anyone, it wasn't particularly moving or interesting, so I began fastforwarding. Only the bits with Jiang Chen showing how he liked Xiaoxi got me squealing and excited.\\n\\nThen it moved to being in university and they did a LOT of time jumps. There was a lot of in the sky, of the sun or of leaves montages which was just unnecessary.\\n\\nVery strange writing, odd beats and pacing. It didn't really seem to have much left to go with.\\n\\nWhen it came to the last episode, I barely noticed because it was so anti climatic and seemed to not really give any real message at the end. It was nice to see the monologue of Jiang Chen and why he liked Xiaoxi.\\n\\nWeird writing and almost mediocre in some parts. It could have been done a whole lot better. Very fluffy, and I would rewatch for those cute moments, but the rest is a bit of rubbish to be honest...\",\n",

Although I like that the OTPs friends were important and had all their own story lines, this dragged out the drama.\\n\\nThe male lead was really static and seemed to have no emotions at all. The female lead on the other hand was often annoying (some might call it bubbly) and all over the place.\\n\\nAgain, the basic idea of showing their love from the beginning to end is great. However, the beginning took about 16 episodes (their high school years), while their collage and after-collage life was wrapped up in 7...this also means 16 episodes of no real deep or romantic encounters, and 7 episodes where they are adults, but again we don't see many lovely scenes. Actually, the last episode was the best, as there was a lot of love included! \\n\\nActing/Cast:\\n\\nAs this was my first cdrama I don't know any of the cast. They made an okay job, though. The characters were quite annoying...\\n\\nMusic:\\n\\nNothing to to remember.\\n\\nRewatch:\\n\\n0/0 I seriously don't know, if I will even watch a cdrama again.... \\n\\nOverall:\\n\\nI get how their deep bond from the beginning is meant to be shown, however it's more suited for a younger audience (about 13+ years) as the focus is on the high school years. I would have loved to watch their adult life more.\",\n",

Sure, the story wasn't original and there are tons of dramas out there with the same theme, but at least they hundled it pretty neat and the final result was decent. Also, the girl was cute and funny, whether the boy was kind of a snob at first, got better afterwards, but kept his attitude, which was refreshing because in most dramas the male lead starts with a i-hate-you-i-am-too-cynical and makes a 360 degrees turn a few episodes later.

       "['Amidst all the positivity and perfection that others see in this drama, you can count on me to be a real grinch and center in on all the reasons that it was not entirely flawless. That is not to say I hated it; far from it, but I fail to share the unwavering, absolute love that many others seem to.\\n\\nMany things about A Love So Beautiful was a surprise to me. I\\'ll be the first to admit that I harbor a real prejudice each time I enter the realm that is a Chinese drama - watching them throughout my childhood, they were unfailingly littered with a) tragedy, b) horrible CG, and/or c) gagworthy storylines (typically, an entertaining combination of all three). And quite honestly, few nowadays seem to impress me. Call it bias, but I still think the Mainland has much to learn regarding what constitutes a good show.\\n\\nA Love So Beautiful was different from the moment I picked it up. It does not present melodramatic conflict for you to brood over, but instead focuses on the innocence of a teenager trying to get through the struggles of school and first love. I did not grow up within the Chinese education system, but there is something incredibly charming and nostalgic about seeing a group of five friends trudge through their high school years. Having teachers scold you, finding unpredictable friendships, secretly liking someone...A person is only naive in such a way for a small amount of time, and this drama perfectly captures that foolish yet heartwarming attitude of youth.\\n\\nIt only helped that the cast consisted of young, yet capable actors. How annoying is it when you watch a show about high school and the actors are in their mid- to late-twenties? And then you spend the entire duration brooding over how old they look and how nothing about them reminds you of a cute teenager. A Love So Beautiful never suffers from this issue; because not only do the main actors look young - they are. They act their parts perfectly, accurately presenting the turbulent feelings of their characters and how they grow over the course of the drama. It\\'s difficult to find five lead actors who interact with one another with so much natural chemistry that it\\'s hard to believe that they\\'re acting.\\n\\nBut turn on the sad music - I\\'m done gushing about all the things I absolutely adored. Here\\'s what dragged it down from a perfect 10: as soon as the characters left high school, the plot began to wander. There is a distinct imbalance between the warmth that is their high school lives and the confusion that is their \"growing up.\" \\n\\nI would like to ensure you that I don\\'t hate the fact that they got older. It was the delivery; how the writers depicted their \"maturing\" that was irksome. What I found particularly problematic was how you spend over half of the drama watching them in high school - and you love it to pieces - but then you have less than eight episodes to watch them speed carelessly through cliche relationship problems and time skips. The transition is rough and the trip doesn\\'t get any smoother. It would have made far more sense to me to either limit the story of this show to their high school years, or add more episodes to spread out their time as they age past university and through adulthood. \\n\\nI simply didn\\'t feel the magic in the latter part of the drama, which follows their post-graduation lives. It\\'s still fine to watch, but it just isn\\'t the same. I wanted to see the ways they carefully sort out problems between themselves and thus mature, not watch as they get angry at one another and resolve it merely because - well, merely because that\\'s the way the writers want it to be. I did not feel as connected to their characters; not because they aren\\'t bubbly teenagers, but because the story slowly becomes more about their problems and less about who they are. To me, their characters are one of the greatest strengths of the plotline, and as it fades throughout, so does the show\\'s primary charm.\\n\\nI would feel bad shutting this drama down entirely, since that would be unfair to the refreshing fun that it brought to me as I marathoned it. It is not without its flaws. However, it made me remember my first feelings of romance and filled my heart to the brim with both happiness and bittersweetness. It\\'s hard to find a drama capable of such an effect on a viewer - and I\\'m glad this one found a way.',\n",
       " 'This drama is said to be another adaptation of the \"It Started With A Kiss\" franchise. I personally haven\\'t watched any of these except for this version thus I\\'m gonna base my review from this alone without any comparison :D.\\n\\nMost of us have experienced studying in high school. Although not everyone had experiences of relationships in high school, most likely we have observed this happenings around us. \"A Love So Beautiful\" is that drama that highlights the \\xa0innocence of high school as well as the experiences of having a crush or falling in love with someone. This drama has a typical high school drama plot line which focuses on the lives of the main characters during high school. This is another instance wherein a drama doesn\\'t appeal to be deep, but merely to be relatable. I\\'ll delve deeper with this review by discussing each components for rating, from its story until the rewatch value.\\n\\nThe story of this drama is light. It\\'s a story that is easy to digest since the story is told in a linear manner. The pacing was kind of steady but the ratio between the past and present was kind of unsatisfying. I believe that the story would\\'ve been more interesting if it was able to balance the two parts of the story since the character development can be highlighted more in a setting as such. Another characteristic of the story is that it\\'s romantic. But this characteristic is a double edged sword. It was able to create a story that can be fantasized by many but it can create misconceptions in terms its main theme: love. It was my dilemma while watching the drama since at times it challenges my thoughts about relationships.\\n\\nNext is the Acting and the Cast. Personally, this component is the one that made me continue watching the series. It might seem a bit contrary since I only gave it an 8.5 out of 10 but I considered many factors in rating this criteria. The casting for this drama is really great. The chemistry between them is really commendable.\\n\\nShen Yue and Hu Yi Tian\\'s chemistry however, is what made this drama special. It can tug heartstrings and it can make you punch or slap the back of someone who is beside you. If the casting was the only thing to take into consideration in rating, I would\\'ve gave this a perfect rating, but there is a need to rate the acting, thus lowering my score. There are many times while watching that I felt sad because there were many opportunities to show more emotions, to give more adlibs but there wasn\\'t anything. Character relationships aren\\'t even an excuse because the acting could\\'ve been better and sometimes, you feel that the acting is a bit too calculated. The latter lines however, pertains to the acting for the two main actors, Shen Yue and Hu Yi Tian. The acting isn\\'t perfect, nor excellent, but it\\'s still commendable.\\n\\nThe music for this drama is actually good but the thing is, it can only be memorable if you don\\'t skip the opening sequence. The theme songs are beautiful, but I the music lacked variety, thus lowering my score.\\n\\nLastly the rewatch value. I personally think that this drama has a really high rewatch value since it\\'s a light watch and also because of the cast remarkable and memorable chemistry. \\n\\nIt has been a long time since I last watched a Chinese drama and I must day, watching this drama was a good and pleasant experience. I recommend that people to watch this if they want a light and a heartwarming drama :D.',\n",
       " \"Finished\\xa0A Love so Beautiful in just 2 days, and I am so glad I was able to watch it right as the year ends! This drama really brought my year of 2017 to a happy ending :)\\n\\nStory/plot: -10- I heard that this storyline was very similar to a Japanese drama/manga called “Itazura na Kiss”; however, I have never watched the drama, or any of their remakes, so I am writing this review with nothing to compare it to, pretty much. With that being said, I loved the storyline of this cutesy, heart-warming drama! The cliche style of a not-so-smart girl liking the perfect guy definitely took a positive turn in this show! The transition between high school to college to adult life was pretty smooth, in my opinion, with majority of it focused during their high school years, which made it an innocent and light drama. As the story moves on to the adult life, the relationship between the main leads became more intimate, which made me squeal so many times at 2 o'clock in the morning.\\n\\nActing/cast: -10- The height difference between the 160cm Chen Xiao Xi (played by Shen Yue) and the tall 188cm Jiang Chen (played by Hu Yi Tian) made me squeal every time! Both of the main leads are decently new faces to the entertainment world, and they definitely made a good impression, on me at least haha! For her first main-lead role in a drama, Shen Yue did a spectacular job of performing the different sides and attitudes of the character, Chen Xiao Xi, from the happy, always positive high school youth to the independent grown women that Chen Xiao Xi becomes later on in the drama. NOW, LET’S TALK ABOUT HU YI TIAN! OMG, HE IS SOME HAWT STUFF! So cute, and for his first main-lead role, he played it really well! It’s hard to fall in love with someone who plays a, supposedly, cold-hearted, not caring character, but later on, we find out that the character, Jiang Chen, is pretty much the opposite! The way Hu Yi Tian smirks and acts to care for Chen Xiao Xi in the drama can make any girl's heart flutter! (I think I found my next man crush tbh) The supporting roles might have not done a whole lot, but their contribution played a huge impact throughout the whole show, and it made the drama 100X better! Nothing to complain in general, great leads, great actors/actresses, and great chemistry! :)\\n\\nMusic: -10- The opening song is truly the perfect fit for the drama! When I first heard it, I already loved it and how the melody matches the drama’s theme, but after reading the lyrics, it made me love the song even more! If you don’t believe me, take a look yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIKib5Bymz8 I especially love the line “wo xihuan ni pei wo kanshu fen xin kan wo tou xiao” which translates to “I like you when you’re accompanying me to read a book, distracted by looking at me, smiling quietly,” it brings back many ridiculous smiles when I watched the drama, and I can't seem to stop replaying the song in my head now!\\n\\nRewatch value: -9.5- I love A Love so Beautiful and I have rewatched my favorite parts more than a dozen time, but I am sorry, I can’t rewatch the whole drama from the beginning to end more than once. I am not sure exactly why, but I guess the whole drama wasn’t capturing enough for me? For the parts that I love though, I have rewatched it so many times, and I will never get bored of rewatching them!\\n\\nOverall: -10- This drama truly created a great end to my 2017! The sweet, yet simple story is my cup of tea! I can’t seem to let go of this drama, it was too good and too sweet! The characters played their parts so well, the mixture of the songs and the cute relationships between the characters are too much to be given up so easily. So sad that I watched it in only 2 days! I wish I would have spent more time to savor every second!\\n\\nIf you are looking for a romantic, and heart-warming drama that takes place mainly during the high school life and transitions to more serious matters later on, A Love so Beautiful is definitely the drama for you! Hope this helps and thanks for reading!\\n\\nChào for Now!\\n\\nLily L.\",\n",
       " 'The only regrets I have with this drama is binge watching it so quickly. Finishing it has left such an empty void in me and I can’t help but make comparisons with any other dramas I watch.\\n\\nThis drama is such a unique case for me because usually I only have interest in Korean dramas and have struggled to enjoy a Chinese drama despite been Chinese myself. I also generally dislike dramas where the female chases after the male. However this drama has a special charm that I am unable to resist, making it probably even my most favourite drama ever in my 4 years of watching Asian dramas.\\n\\nMany people may think of Xiaoxi as a dumb bimbo whose life revolves around a guy and while this may be true we must remember that she is a high school girl and at the time where the desire for romance is very strong.\\xa0She makes mistakes and is most definitely not perfect.\\xa0As the drama progresses, we begin to see her development into an independent lady that is not as easily swayed by Jiangchen until she is treated right. Also she too has her own hobbies and aspirations that do not revolve around Jiangchen which is something that is not commonly shown in dramas with similar themes. No she does not become a nurse for Jiangchen.\\n\\nNONE of the character are perfect. Not even the seemingly perfect Jiangchen whose jealously often gets the better of him and also has his own insecurities just like the next person. \\xa0This makes the drama even more likeable and relatable. They all make mistakes and all learn from it.\\xa0\\n\\nThe drama is a perfect example of taking a very cliche and used plot and twisting it into a unique and charming drama that will remain in our hearts for a very very long time.',\n",

       " 'A love so beautiful was a great love story. I loved the storyline and how it flowed, It wasn\\'t rushed and it wasn\\'t too slow it was perfect. I usually don\\'t like high school centered dramas and when I found out that this story focused a lot of time in High school I almost didn\\'t watch. However, The cast is awesome, great chemistry. I was drawn in throughout the storyline I didn\\'t even know who to root for the second lead was as mature, sweet and handsome as the main lead.  I hated how the mother kind of disliked the second lead because of his \"dark skin\" but it wasn\\'t a big deal and didn\\'t overshadow the show at all it was just something that bugged me personally because I thought he was a cutie.  I love how the show didn\\'t waste time on trivial things other shows would be the main character failed her college entrance exam and had to retake the exam instead of focusing on that for 5 episodes the audience got a condensed episode of study scene and college life which was great because it cuts out the filler episodes and leaves room for more productive content.  Overall great show, great cast, and storyline.',\n",
       " \"This drama is absolutely amazing, 10/10 my favorite drama of all time. I have watched it 4 times in total! And I have never rewatched anything this much. The story and overall show and characters is very different from your typical Chinese drama. This one is very special. It isn't over exaggerated and fake like most Chinese dramas such as Meteor Garden or Boys Over Flowers. This drama depicts REAL life in China as a highschool student. It really brings you into their lives and the things they deal with. This is a must see for anyone who likes Asian dramas.\",\n",
       " 'Firstly, I have seen many Chinese dramas and this one balanced every factor beautifully. I felt that it was just the right length (24 eps, compared to the usual 40+ with terrible plot lines, and episodes that just drag), and seemed to follow the formula for a Korean drama, in that it was clever and not too predictable. \\n\\nI was fully invested in both the lead and supporting characters, in most dramas I tend to skip the part of the supporting characters, but not this time; everyone really held their weight. I really thought the actors outdid themselves in every aspect, and the chemistry made me hold my breath at times. \\n\\nEven though many compare this to Playful Kiss, I\\'d say that yes, there are some similarities, but it is very unique and not nearly as \"silly\" and \"annoying\" as that show. This felt similar to a slice of life/school anime initially which developed into a very sweet romance. There is also that trait that is often seen with the girl with really short hair being loud and spontaneous, like in Reply 1984, and even the Taiwanese version of Skip Beat (which is the closest, I just kept thinking of Ivy Chen). It was nice to see maturity evolve particularly in the female lead character, from start to finish. \\n\\nOne final thought that kept crossing my mind throughout the show was that I really wanted to have such supportive friends as the lead character had, I was actually jealous at times because they portrayed such a genuine friendship. I laughed with them and cried when it was tough, the emotional investment was there. I think that is why this show also reminded me of animes like Toradora and Kokoro Connect (and even Clannad, but don\\'t take it too far)',\n",
       " \"The drama was quite cute and I appreciated being able to watch the main characters age and grow together, especially the high school portions of the drama. There were a few parts of the plot and the writing which I found particularly week, especially about the main couple's inability to communicate properly. After dating for a while, I wasn't expecting their first big spat to end as childishly as it did, and I found the heroine pretty selfish, leading on a guy when she knew she wasn't fully over her first love, dragging on a relationship for actual years, which was so disrespectful on her part. There were a lot of moments where she was too irrational and too brash, but I respected that despite that, it seemed to somehow work with her character. Their relationship was awkward, but it really felt right, and the ending was more than satisfying, I admit I shed a tear when I saw them walk down the path as adults, holding hands, slowly becoming their teenage selves again, really the beautiful finish that the drama deserved.\\n\\nI think that while the main couple were amazing, the real stars came in the form of the lead roles. The second male lead was the perfect mixture of too kind and too quiet to really make the audience empathise with his position, and while I was rooting for the main couple, I always felt upset when I saw the Bu Song's (second-male-lead) reaction. His acting was so convincing and his character was perfect in balancing out their fivesome.\\n\\nMy personal favourites were Lu Yang and Jing Xiao. They were amazing best friends and were genuinely supportive of everyone  in their little group. When they overcame their High School problems and became a strong couple i university, I was so happy, but they also made me want to hit the main couple's heads because really,  couldn't they just look to their friends for example and realise that communication is integral in a relationship?? \\n\\nWhile the drama largely centered around romance, I really think that the moments that focused on friendship were the strongest written parts. All the scenes where the fivesome help each other overcome problems, or just hang out for fun is ingrained in my memory, because they really made such a lovely little family for themselves.\"]"

    "    * When the reviewers are writing a review for a drama, they are likely to often refer to themselves and talk about their personal feelings or engagement with the drama, so the word *`i`* occurs a lot in the review text.\n",
    "    * Similarly, since they are writing about a drama, they would keep referring to the drama, too. This might explain the frequent occurrence of the words *`it`*, *`this`*, and *`drama`*.\n",
    "* The word *`love`* ranks the 17th. This is reasonable since the drama is about puppy love and might trigger the reviewers to talk about love -- either their own love stories or the love stories in the drama.\n",
    "* The word *`school`* occurs 57 times. The drama has a setting in school, which might remind the reviewers of their youth memories in school.\n",
    "* The word *`cute`* occurs 54 times. It is very likely the word that the reviewers would use to describe the story or the characters in the drama.\n",
    "* One word that worths paying attention to is *`chen`*. This is the last name of the female lead character; it is also the first name of the male lead character. It is common that the reviews mention about the characters, but in this case, the problem with the one-word frequency list is that we would not know which character the *`chen`* is referring to. So it might be a good idea to look at a bigram frequency list or even a trigram frequency list."

       "[\"I was putting off watching this drama for a while. I always saw it under 'top dramas', my recommendation feed, reviews where it was called as another ISWAK/Itazura na Kiss/Playful Kiss, etc.\\n\\nBefore I began watching this I was only familiar with the male lead in a drama where his role wasn't too big. I did know that he is quite decent so decided to go ahead. Here's what I thought finally:\\n\\nSTORY: On the surface it comes off as another youth drama. However what I liked most about the drama was the simplicity of the plot. It's just about a group of friends, an annoying love triangle, a jerk male lead and ditz female lead. I can see the comparisons with ISWAK but nothing tops that. It would be fair to say this was at least inspired from that story. But what sets this drama apart are the likeable characters and the trivial-yet-relatable situations they go through. Their friendship was excellent and it was best part for me over the romantic plot. \\n\\nCHARACTERS AND LOVE TRIANGLE: I had a love-hate relationship with Xiao Xi. She's cute, simple but was too dense for my liking. I also don't like how she seemed not to have any self-respect. I was often uncomfortable with the message this drama keeps giving- it's fine to keep chasing someone even if they walk all over you. Not saying that Jiang Chen didn't like her, but he was mean to her majority of the drama. For me I was all in on the second lead ship. I haven't suffered such major Second Lead Syndrome since AGES. Bo Song deserved Xiao Xi's love. I hated how stone cold she was to him and even seemed ungrateful at times. He did so much for her but she always had one person in her heart. I would blame the writer for this plot because the better moments were written between Xiao Xi and Bo Song. She kept hanging with him till the last 2 episodes, not acknowledging his love. For god's sake, she spent her entire life with a one-sided love and I couldn't buy how she couldn't recognise Bo Song's love throughout regardless of what he said to her. I didn't really buy Jiang Chen as a character, his reason for being mean to her and why he liked her. He just seemed like a selfish person to me who played and manipulated her as he wished. I liked his adult side better because he had at least become more mature and expressive by then. I did enjoy his interactions with Xiao Xi towards the end. The other two friends were awesome and I was glad about having a secondary couple on the show.\\n\\nFLAWS: It was slow, seemed to have borrowed ideas and lack of plot in between episodes. One thing that is rarely explained in Chinese dramas is why the leads fall for each other. In this drama also I had no clue. Especially Xiao Xi's devotion to JC was hard to understand. It was more than just fangirl feelings or puppy love. She was stupid, playful and childish but was bold when it came to pursuing him and had only him in her heart forever.\\n\\nI think this drama is cute if you want to watch something relaxing without much drama. The drama was slow but it was consistent in following its own pacing in all the episodes. Just don't root for the second lead and this drama might just be more enjoyable.\",\n",
       " 'Story :\\n\\nFresh! That\\'s my first thought when I start to watch this series. This series is quite mild, but the development of everyone\\'s personality and feelings are clearly visible here. One thing I like the most here is the friendship. This series does not recognize the phrase \"love will destroy the friendship\". They still support each other even though the person they like likes someone else. And I really love how that friendship continues to develop until they are grow up.\\n\\nSometimes I feel exasperated by Chen Xiao Xi\\'s childish attitude, but well, maybe when I was in school I did the same thing. LOL. And I really love to see when Jiang Chen feels jealous seeing Chen Xiao Xi and Wu Bo Song\\'s closeness ^_^\\n\\nActing/Cast :\\n\\nThey all did great and so natural, but I especially love Shen Yue acting. She\\'s so cute I can\\'t help it but to adore her ^_^\\n\\nMusic :\\n\\nThe opening and ending song are so easy listening, and I put them both on my Spotify playlist now ^_^\\n\\nRewatch Value :\\n\\nI definitely will watch this series again if I need some cuteness in my life.',\n",
       " \"''A Love So Beautiful'' was the first C-Drama that I've ever watched!\\n\\nThe story isn't something fresh or new, talks about a looong friendship that turns into something more into a 12 year timelapse.\\n\\nI've really appreciated it because doesn't tend to fall into boring long and unappropriated scenes like many other Chinese dramas, everything super smooth and easy-going.\\n\\nI absolutely loved the second lead, also the main couple made wonderful work!\\n\\nMore than a drama, I can consider it more as a long journey with the cast into their life as teenagers till adults!\\n\\nAbsolutely worth the time spent by watching it!\",\n",
       " 'First of all, I am a sucker for teen dramas (especially high school dramas), so I absolutely loved this drama! I thought the story was so well organised and interesting. I usually don’t watch Chinese dramas as I think they often overact and can be too cringe but I found this drama extremely fun watching despite the amount of cringy scenes. \\n\\nThe main characters chemistry is so amazing and I think that the love story in the drama is really good and sweet. The main couple is definitely the reason that I kept watching the drama as they show so sincere love. And who doesn’t love a love triangle. \\n\\nThe friendship between the five main characters is what I really liked in the drama. However I do think that the story was too slow in some aspects. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to start watching Chinese dramas.',\n",
       " 'I watched this on Netflix and I have re-watched this over a dozen times!\\n\\nThis series brought me back to my childhood, where I had crushes and a lot of  heartbreaks!  It is very relatable!\\n\\nShen Yue, Hu Yi Tian and the rest of the cast portrayed their roles well.  \\n\\nHaving read the book, I wish it had more episodes to really show their life together as an \"adult couple\".\\n\\nThis series brought laughter, excitement, tears and admiration for me and I love that it brought that many emotions.']"

For example, we see words such as *`school`* and *`cute`* that show up very often in the reviews, but we cannot tell from the frequency list in what contexts these words appear and how these words are used. So for the next part, I am going to choose a word of interest from the word frequency list for each year and use concordance analysis to take a closer look at them. By investigating a specific word in context, we can summarize certain patterns used with the word and discover meaning in these patterns."

       "  'Review Text': 'Amidst all the positivity and perfection that others see in this drama, you can count on me to be a real grinch and center in on all the reasons that it was not entirely flawless. That is not to say I hated it; far from it, but I fail to share the unwavering, absolute love that many others seem to.\\n\\nMany things about A Love So Beautiful was a surprise to me. I\\'ll be the first to admit that I harbor a real prejudice each time I enter the realm that is a Chinese drama - watching them throughout my childhood, they were unfailingly littered with a) tragedy, b) horrible CG, and/or c) gagworthy storylines (typically, an entertaining combination of all three). And quite honestly, few nowadays seem to impress me. Call it bias, but I still think the Mainland has much to learn regarding what constitutes a good show.\\n\\nA Love So Beautiful was different from the moment I picked it up. It does not present melodramatic conflict for you to brood over, but instead focuses on the innocence of a teenager trying to get through the struggles of school and first love. I did not grow up within the Chinese education system, but there is something incredibly charming and nostalgic about seeing a group of five friends trudge through their high school years. Having teachers scold you, finding unpredictable friendships, secretly liking someone...A person is only naive in such a way for a small amount of time, and this drama perfectly captures that foolish yet heartwarming attitude of youth.\\n\\nIt only helped that the cast consisted of young, yet capable actors. How annoying is it when you watch a show about high school and the actors are in their mid- to late-twenties? And then you spend the entire duration brooding over how old they look and how nothing about them reminds you of a cute teenager. A Love So Beautiful never suffers from this issue; because not only do the main actors look young - they are. They act their parts perfectly, accurately presenting the turbulent feelings of their characters and how they grow over the course of the drama. It\\'s difficult to find five lead actors who interact with one another with so much natural chemistry that it\\'s hard to believe that they\\'re acting.\\n\\nBut turn on the sad music - I\\'m done gushing about all the things I absolutely adored. Here\\'s what dragged it down from a perfect 10: as soon as the characters left high school, the plot began to wander. There is a distinct imbalance between the warmth that is their high school lives and the confusion that is their \"growing up.\" \\n\\nI would like to ensure you that I don\\'t hate the fact that they got older. It was the delivery; how the writers depicted their \"maturing\" that was irksome. What I found particularly problematic was how you spend over half of the drama watching them in high school - and you love it to pieces - but then you have less than eight episodes to watch them speed carelessly through cliche relationship problems and time skips. The transition is rough and the trip doesn\\'t get any smoother. It would have made far more sense to me to either limit the story of this show to their high school years, or add more episodes to spread out their time as they age past university and through adulthood. \\n\\nI simply didn\\'t feel the magic in the latter part of the drama, which follows their post-graduation lives. It\\'s still fine to watch, but it just isn\\'t the same. I wanted to see the ways they carefully sort out problems between themselves and thus mature, not watch as they get angry at one another and resolve it merely because - well, merely because that\\'s the way the writers want it to be. I did not feel as connected to their characters; not because they aren\\'t bubbly teenagers, but because the story slowly becomes more about their problems and less about who they are. To me, their characters are one of the greatest strengths of the plotline, and as it fades throughout, so does the show\\'s primary charm.\\n\\nI would feel bad shutting this drama down entirely, since that would be unfair to the refreshing fun that it brought to me as I marathoned it. It is not without its flaws. However, it made me remember my first feelings of romance and filled my heart to the brim with both happiness and bittersweetness. It\\'s hard to find a drama capable of such an effect on a viewer - and I\\'m glad this one found a way.',\n",

       "  'Review Text': 'This drama is said to be another adaptation of the \"It Started With A Kiss\" franchise. I personally haven\\'t watched any of these except for this version thus I\\'m gonna base my review from this alone without any comparison :D.\\n\\nMost of us have experienced studying in high school. Although not everyone had experiences of relationships in high school, most likely we have observed this happenings around us. \"A Love So Beautiful\" is that drama that highlights the \\xa0innocence of high school as well as the experiences of having a crush or falling in love with someone. This drama has a typical high school drama plot line which focuses on the lives of the main characters during high school. This is another instance wherein a drama doesn\\'t appeal to be deep, but merely to be relatable. I\\'ll delve deeper with this review by discussing each components for rating, from its story until the rewatch value.\\n\\nThe story of this drama is light. It\\'s a story that is easy to digest since the story is told in a linear manner. The pacing was kind of steady but the ratio between the past and present was kind of unsatisfying. I believe that the story would\\'ve been more interesting if it was able to balance the two parts of the story since the character development can be highlighted more in a setting as such. Another characteristic of the story is that it\\'s romantic. But this characteristic is a double edged sword. It was able to create a story that can be fantasized by many but it can create misconceptions in terms its main theme: love. It was my dilemma while watching the drama since at times it challenges my thoughts about relationships.\\n\\nNext is the Acting and the Cast. Personally, this component is the one that made me continue watching the series. It might seem a bit contrary since I only gave it an 8.5 out of 10 but I considered many factors in rating this criteria. The casting for this drama is really great. The chemistry between them is really commendable.\\n\\nShen Yue and Hu Yi Tian\\'s chemistry however, is what made this drama special. It can tug heartstrings and it can make you punch or slap the back of someone who is beside you. If the casting was the only thing to take into consideration in rating, I would\\'ve gave this a perfect rating, but there is a need to rate the acting, thus lowering my score. There are many times while watching that I felt sad because there were many opportunities to show more emotions, to give more adlibs but there wasn\\'t anything. Character relationships aren\\'t even an excuse because the acting could\\'ve been better and sometimes, you feel that the acting is a bit too calculated. The latter lines however, pertains to the acting for the two main actors, Shen Yue and Hu Yi Tian. The acting isn\\'t perfect, nor excellent, but it\\'s still commendable.\\n\\nThe music for this drama is actually good but the thing is, it can only be memorable if you don\\'t skip the opening sequence. The theme songs are beautiful, but I the music lacked variety, thus lowering my score.\\n\\nLastly the rewatch value. I personally think that this drama has a really high rewatch value since it\\'s a light watch and also because of the cast remarkable and memorable chemistry. \\n\\nIt has been a long time since I last watched a Chinese drama and I must day, watching this drama was a good and pleasant experience. I recommend that people to watch this if they want a light and a heartwarming drama :D.',\n",

       "  'Review Text': \"Finished\\xa0A Love so Beautiful in just 2 days, and I am so glad I was able to watch it right as the year ends! This drama really brought my year of 2017 to a happy ending :)\\n\\nStory/plot: -10- I heard that this storyline was very similar to a Japanese drama/manga called “Itazura na Kiss”; however, I have never watched the drama, or any of their remakes, so I am writing this review with nothing to compare it to, pretty much. With that being said, I loved the storyline of this cutesy, heart-warming drama! The cliche style of a not-so-smart girl liking the perfect guy definitely took a positive turn in this show! The transition between high school to college to adult life was pretty smooth, in my opinion, with majority of it focused during their high school years, which made it an innocent and light drama. As the story moves on to the adult life, the relationship between the main leads became more intimate, which made me squeal so many times at 2 o'clock in the morning.\\n\\nActing/cast: -10- The height difference between the 160cm Chen Xiao Xi (played by Shen Yue) and the tall 188cm Jiang Chen (played by Hu Yi Tian) made me squeal every time! Both of the main leads are decently new faces to the entertainment world, and they definitely made a good impression, on me at least haha! For her first main-lead role in a drama, Shen Yue did a spectacular job of performing the different sides and attitudes of the character, Chen Xiao Xi, from the happy, always positive high school youth to the independent grown women that Chen Xiao Xi becomes later on in the drama. NOW, LET’S TALK ABOUT HU YI TIAN! OMG, HE IS SOME HAWT STUFF! So cute, and for his first main-lead role, he played it really well! It’s hard to fall in love with someone who plays a, supposedly, cold-hearted, not caring character, but later on, we find out that the character, Jiang Chen, is pretty much the opposite! The way Hu Yi Tian smirks and acts to care for Chen Xiao Xi in the drama can make any girl's heart flutter! (I think I found my next man crush tbh) The supporting roles might have not done a whole lot, but their contribution played a huge impact throughout the whole show, and it made the drama 100X better! Nothing to complain in general, great leads, great actors/actresses, and great chemistry! :)\\n\\nMusic: -10- The opening song is truly the perfect fit for the drama! When I first heard it, I already loved it and how the melody matches the drama’s theme, but after reading the lyrics, it made me love the song even more! If you don’t believe me, take a look yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIKib5Bymz8 I especially love the line “wo xihuan ni pei wo kanshu fen xin kan wo tou xiao” which translates to “I like you when you’re accompanying me to read a book, distracted by looking at me, smiling quietly,” it brings back many ridiculous smiles when I watched the drama, and I can't seem to stop replaying the song in my head now!\\n\\nRewatch value: -9.5- I love A Love so Beautiful and I have rewatched my favorite parts more than a dozen time, but I am sorry, I can’t rewatch the whole drama from the beginning to end more than once. I am not sure exactly why, but I guess the whole drama wasn’t capturing enough for me? For the parts that I love though, I have rewatched it so many times, and I will never get bored of rewatching them!\\n\\nOverall: -10- This drama truly created a great end to my 2017! The sweet, yet simple story is my cup of tea! I can’t seem to let go of this drama, it was too good and too sweet! The characters played their parts so well, the mixture of the songs and the cute relationships between the characters are too much to be given up so easily. So sad that I watched it in only 2 days! I wish I would have spent more time to savor every second!\\n\\nIf you are looking for a romantic, and heart-warming drama that takes place mainly during the high school life and transitions to more serious matters later on, A Love so Beautiful is definitely the drama for you! Hope this helps and thanks for reading!\\n\\nChào for Now!\\n\\nLily L.\",\n",

However this drama has a special charm that I am unable to resist, making it probably even my most favourite drama ever in my 4 years of watching Asian dramas.\\n\\nMany people may think of Xiaoxi as a dumb bimbo whose life revolves around a guy and while this may be true we must remember that she is a high school girl and at the time where the desire for romance is very strong.\\xa0She makes mistakes and is most definitely not perfect.\\xa0As the drama progresses, we begin to see her development into an independent lady that is not as easily swayed by Jiangchen until she is treated right. Also she too has her own hobbies and aspirations that do not revolve around Jiangchen which is something that is not commonly shown in dramas with similar themes. No she does not become a nurse for Jiangchen.\\n\\nNONE of the character are perfect. Not even the seemingly perfect Jiangchen whose jealously often gets the better of him and also has his own insecurities just like the next person. \\xa0This makes the drama even more likeable and relatable. They all make mistakes and all learn from it.\\xa0\\n\\nThe drama is a perfect example of taking a very cliche and used plot and twisting it into a unique and charming drama that will remain in our hearts for a very very long time.',\n",

I hated how the mother kind of disliked the second lead because of his \"dark skin\" but it wasn\\'t a big deal and didn\\'t overshadow the show at all it was just something that bugged me personally because I thought he was a cutie.  I love how the show didn\\'t waste time on trivial things other shows would be the main character failed her college entrance exam and had to retake the exam instead of focusing on that for 5 episodes the audience got a condensed episode of study scene and college life which was great because it cuts out the filler episodes and leaves room for more productive content.

It isn't over exaggerated and fake like most Chinese dramas such as Meteor Garden or Boys Over Flowers. This drama depicts REAL life in China as a highschool student.

I felt that it was just the right length (24 eps, compared to the usual 40+ with terrible plot lines, and episodes that just drag), and seemed to follow the formula for a Korean drama, in that it was clever and not too predictable. \\n\\nI was fully invested in both the lead and supporting characters, in most dramas I tend to skip the part of the supporting characters, but not this time; everyone really held their weight. I really thought the actors outdid themselves in every aspect, and the chemistry made me hold my breath at times. \\n\\nEven though many compare this to Playful Kiss, I\\'d say that yes, there are some similarities, but it is very unique and not nearly as \"silly\" and \"annoying\" as that show. This felt similar to a slice of life/school anime initially which developed into a very sweet romance. There is also that trait that is often seen with the girl with really short hair being loud and spontaneous, like in Reply 1984, and even the Taiwanese version of Skip Beat (which is the closest, I just kept thinking of Ivy Chen). It was nice to see maturity evolve particularly in the female lead character, from start to finish. \\n\\nOne final thought that kept crossing my mind throughout the show was that I really wanted to have such supportive friends as the lead character had, I was actually jealous at times because they portrayed such a genuine friendship. I laughed with them and cried when it was tough, the emotional investment was there. I think that is why this show also reminded me of animes like Toradora and Kokoro Connect (and even Clannad, but don\\'t take it too far)',\n",

       "  'Review Text': \"The drama was quite cute and I appreciated being able to watch the main characters age and grow together, especially the high school portions of the drama. There were a few parts of the plot and the writing which I found particularly week, especially about the main couple's inability to communicate properly. After dating for a while, I wasn't expecting their first big spat to end as childishly as it did, and I found the heroine pretty selfish, leading on a guy when she knew she wasn't fully over her first love, dragging on a relationship for actual years, which was so disrespectful on her part. There were a lot of moments where she was too irrational and too brash, but I respected that despite that, it seemed to somehow work with her character. Their relationship was awkward, but it really felt right, and the ending was more than satisfying, I admit I shed a tear when I saw them walk down the path as adults, holding hands, slowly becoming their teenage selves again, really the beautiful finish that the drama deserved.\\n\\nI think that while the main couple were amazing, the real stars came in the form of the lead roles. The second male lead was the perfect mixture of too kind and too quiet to really make the audience empathise with his position, and while I was rooting for the main couple, I always felt upset when I saw the Bu Song's (second-male-lead) reaction. His acting was so convincing and his character was perfect in balancing out their fivesome.\\n\\nMy personal favourites were Lu Yang and Jing Xiao. They were amazing best friends and were genuinely supportive of everyone  in their little group. When they overcame their High School problems and became a strong couple i university, I was so happy, but they also made me want to hit the main couple's heads because really,  couldn't they just look to their friends for example and realise that communication is integral in a relationship?? \\n\\nWhile the drama largely centered around romance, I really think that the moments that focused on friendship were the strongest written parts. All the scenes where the fivesome help each other overcome problems, or just hang out for fun is ingrained in my memory, because they really made such a lovely little family for themselves.\",\n",

       "  'Review Text': \"I was putting off watching this drama for a while. I always saw it under 'top dramas', my recommendation feed, reviews where it was called as another ISWAK/Itazura na Kiss/Playful Kiss, etc.\\n\\nBefore I began watching this I was only familiar with the male lead in a drama where his role wasn't too big. I did know that he is quite decent so decided to go ahead. Here's what I thought finally:\\n\\nSTORY: On the surface it comes off as another youth drama. However what I liked most about the drama was the simplicity of the plot. It's just about a group of friends, an annoying love triangle, a jerk male lead and ditz female lead. I can see the comparisons with ISWAK but nothing tops that. It would be fair to say this was at least inspired from that story. But what sets this drama apart are the likeable characters and the trivial-yet-relatable situations they go through. Their friendship was excellent and it was best part for me over the romantic plot. \\n\\nCHARACTERS AND LOVE TRIANGLE: I had a love-hate relationship with Xiao Xi. She's cute, simple but was too dense for my liking. I also don't like how she seemed not to have any self-respect. I was often uncomfortable with the message this drama keeps giving- it's fine to keep chasing someone even if they walk all over you. Not saying that Jiang Chen didn't like her, but he was mean to her majority of the drama. For me I was all in on the second lead ship. I haven't suffered such major Second Lead Syndrome since AGES. Bo Song deserved Xiao Xi's love. I hated how stone cold she was to him and even seemed ungrateful at times. He did so much for her but she always had one person in her heart. I would blame the writer for this plot because the better moments were written between Xiao Xi and Bo Song. She kept hanging with him till the last 2 episodes, not acknowledging his love. For god's sake, she spent her entire life with a one-sided love and I couldn't buy how she couldn't recognise Bo Song's love throughout regardless of what he said to her. I didn't really buy Jiang Chen as a character, his reason for being mean to her and why he liked her. He just seemed like a selfish person to me who played and manipulated her as he wished. I liked his adult side better because he had at least become more mature and expressive by then. I did enjoy his interactions with Xiao Xi towards the end. The other two friends were awesome and I was glad about having a secondary couple on the show.\\n\\nFLAWS: It was slow, seemed to have borrowed ideas and lack of plot in between episodes. One thing that is rarely explained in Chinese dramas is why the leads fall for each other. In this drama also I had no clue. Especially Xiao Xi's devotion to JC was hard to understand. It was more than just fangirl feelings or puppy love. She was stupid, playful and childish but was bold when it came to pursuing him and had only him in her heart forever.\\n\\nI think this drama is cute if you want to watch something relaxing without much drama. The drama was slow but it was consistent in following its own pacing in all the episodes. Just don't root for the second lead and this drama might just be more enjoyable.\",\n",

I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to start watching Chinese dramas.',\n",

Although I like that the OTPs friends were important and had all their own story lines, this dragged out the drama.\\n\\nThe male lead was really static and seemed to have no emotions at all. The female lead on the other hand was often annoying (some might call it bubbly) and all over the place.\\n\\nAgain, the basic idea of showing their love from the beginning to end is great. However, the beginning took about 16 episodes (their high school years), while their collage and after-collage life was wrapped up in 7...this also means 16 episodes of no real deep or romantic encounters, and 7 episodes where they are adults, but again we don't see many lovely scenes. Actually, the last episode was the best, as there was a lot of love included! \\n\\nActing/Cast:\\n\\nAs this was my first cdrama I don't know any of the cast. They made an okay job, though. The characters were quite annoying...\\n\\nMusic:\\n\\nNothing to to remember.\\n\\nRewatch:\\n\\n0/0 I seriously don't know, if I will even watch a cdrama again.... \\n\\nOverall:\\n\\nI get how their deep bond from the beginning is meant to be shown, however it's more suited for a younger audience (about 13+ years) as the focus is on the high school years.

I watched this drama because 1) it\\'s pretty popular in China for a webdrama and I pretty much check out whatever is popular in China regardless whether it is popular here on MDL and 2) my best friend likes cute romances and I really wanted to make her watch something Chinese this winter break before we parted ways again.\\n\\nStory:\\n\\nWhat I liked:\\n\\n1) The entire group of friends together was very fun to watch. Loved the chemistry of their friendship together. I didn\\'t skip any friendship scenes.\\n\\n2) Their high school lives were more interesting than their adult lives.\\n\\n3) Need a friend like Lin Jingxiao in life. Supportive, smart, and caring.\\n\\nWhat I disliked:\\n\\n1) the main girl was literally SOOOOOO dumb like I don\\'t think I know of a dumber female lead than her character. very few get into a good university like Zhejiang on their second gaokao\\n\\n2) when Jiang Chen was jealous, he would act mean to her. I get this is supposed to be out of jealousy, but his actions seriously irked me.\\n\\n3) Jiang Chen giving up the chance to go to Qinghua. And then almost giving up the internship opportunity. And also selling his car to pay for her manhua thing. Like yeah, I guess those actions are supposed to be romantic, but I thought they were straight up stupid moves.\\n\\n4) liked the second lead initially. towards the end, I\\'d really wish he could just move on to someone else\\n\\n5) lack of communication in their relationship was sooooo idek what to say lol\\n\\n6) their break up was sooooooo.....anticlimatic didn\\'t feel a thing\\n\\n7) the drama felt like it was slowing down at the end\\n\\n8) the second couple scenes were pretty boring, skipped a lot of their scenes as the drama progressed\\n\\n9) I didn\\'t like how even though Chen Xiaoxi knew her grades sucked, she hardly put any work into bringing them up. Like yeah, if she didn\\'t want to ask Jiang Chen, then I get it, but her BEST FRIEND is literally one of the top students in the class and she still didn\\'t use her resources LOL\\n\\nActing/Cast:\\n\\nActing-wise, they were okay. They\\'re all new actors, so I have nothing to compare to. They weren\\'t spectacular, but they weren\\'t terrible either. I think one of my biggest issues was with Hu Yitian\\'s line-reading skills. He speaks pretty unclearly and has poor enunciation (I am fluent in Chinese so this bothered me while I was listening, but if you don\\'t speak it, then you should be okay with it). Also his voice is really monotonous LOL. But he\\'s tall and pretty cute.\\n\\nMusic:\\n\\nI don\\'t really think there was much music played for this drama, but I quite like the opening theme song!! Ending theme song is meh but the opening one is nice.\\n\\nRewatch Value:\\n\\nNever rewatching this again LOL I mean the drama wasn\\'t terrible but I was pretty bored and not captivated\\n\\nOverall:\\n\\nIt\\'s a good drama to watch if you have nothing to do, or if you\\'re like me, have a friend who likes cute romances. I heard they deviated quite a bit from the book. \"Prime example of an adaption gone wrong by removing all the likeable traits from the main characters. Chen Xiaoxi was never this brainless, and Jiang Chen never leads his potential love interests on. I would’ve preferred a story that spent more time on their adulthood (as in the original), especially when it’s clear the only purpose of the schoolyard love triangles was to drag out the episode coount.\" (Source: Cfensi).

I also liked the second lead Bu Wongsu and how he tried his best, but I especially loved how Jiang Chen would feel jealous and threatened by him.\\n\\nBut Xiaoxi is such a nothing, whiny, submissive, pathetic character!\\n\\nA lot of the series is spent on school life, but because it was hard to connect to anyone, it wasn't particularly moving or interesting, so I began fastforwarding. Only the bits with Jiang Chen showing how he liked Xiaoxi got me squealing and excited.\\n\\nThen it moved to being in university and they did a LOT of time jumps. There was a lot of in the sky, of the sun or of leaves montages which was just unnecessary.\\n\\nVery strange writing, odd beats and pacing. It didn't really seem to have much left to go with.\\n\\nWhen it came to the last episode, I barely noticed because it was so anti climatic and seemed to not really give any real message at the end. It was nice to see the monologue of Jiang Chen and why he liked Xiaoxi.\\n\\nWeird writing and almost mediocre in some parts. It could have been done a whole lot better.

I actually feel pity for her sometimes, but then she does a stupid thing and I don't feel pity anymore.\\n\\nSecond male (Bosong(?)): had good intentions but was too annoying sometimes.

There were a few parts of the plot and the writing which I found particularly week, especially about the main couple's inability to communicate properly. After dating for a while, I wasn't expecting their first big spat to end as childishly as it did, and I found the heroine pretty selfish, leading on a guy when she knew she wasn't fully over her first love, dragging on a relationship for actual years, which was so disrespectful on her part. There were a lot of moments where she was too irrational and too brash, but I respected that despite that, it seemed to somehow work with her character. Their relationship was awkward, but it really felt right, and the ending was more than satisfying, I admit I shed a tear when I saw them walk down the path as adults, holding hands, slowly becoming their teenage selves again, really the beautiful finish that the drama deserved.\\n\\nI think that while the main couple were amazing, the real stars came in the form of the lead roles. The second male lead was the perfect mixture of too kind and too quiet to really make the audience empathise with his position, and while I was rooting for the main couple, I always felt upset when I saw the Bu Song's (second-male-lead) reaction. His acting was so convincing and his character was perfect in balancing out their fivesome.\\n\\nMy personal favourites were Lu Yang and Jing Xiao. They were amazing best friends and were genuinely supportive of everyone  in their little group. When they overcame their High School problems and became a strong couple i university, I was so happy, but they also made me want to hit the main couple's heads because really,  couldn't they just look to their friends for example and realise that communication is integral in a relationship?? \\n\\nWhile the drama largely centered around romance, I really think that the moments that focused on friendship were the strongest written parts. All the scenes where the fivesome help each other overcome problems, or just hang out for fun is ingrained in my memory, because they really made such a lovely little family for themselves.\",\n",

Everything is beautiful and sweet. This drama is appropriately named. There were only sparks of love though which I will get into later. The writing for this drama is  realistic albeit somewhat childish.  Yet, even with the childish lens, there were occasional moments of great acting from our fresh faced actors.\\n\\nCons: One major con for me is the length of time the producers chose to focus on the high school portion of their lives. I had no qualms with the time period.  I was more annoyed that our protagonists had to remain in that simple and childish mindset for nearly 17 episodes.  I got way too bored.  I hoped that with the group moving on to college that things will start to pick up in drama land.  It does a bit but not in the way that I expected. I was not expecting that college and career life meant spending a LOT of time with Xiao Xi and Jiang Chen while everyone else just falls into background noise.  \\n\\nMoving on to our love duo of Xiao Xi and Jiang Chen.  I am sorry. I just didn\\'t buy it. Jiang Chen spent a lot of time in the first few episodes closing doors in Xiao Xi\\'s face, looking annoyed that she\\'s around and overall just looking like he was just not into her.  Even when he ends up falling in love with her, I just did not see it in Yi Tian\\'s face.  His face is like an emotional void.  It might be his character but Yi Tian was a man of few expressions so who knew what emotion he was really trying to portray in that scene.  Maybe it was supposed to be love but it came across as bleh...?\\n\\nAlso for heaven sake can this drama be any harsher to Wu Bo Song?  He spends the entire time playing 5th wheel while also selflessly being the sweetest human being alive to Xiao Xi. I don\\'t have second lead syndrome.  I have \"can my boy catch a break\" syndrome. That poor pitiful fool.\\n\\nAnyway, I did find the height difference between Shen Yue and Hu Yi Tian to be quite adorable.  Definitely a plus for all of the cute koala hugging moments.',\n",

       "  'Review Text': 'Sorry if this is long. I rarely finish a drama so I want to write thoughtful reviews whenever I do from now on! \\n\\nShort review:\\n\\nThis drama is cute! If you want a cute fluff, this drama is definitely for you! Think: Itazura Na Kiss but less elaborate and a bit more variety in characters and instances. \\n\\nThe more elaborate review: \\n\\nI RARELY finish a drama but for some reason, I breezed through this one pretty easily! I watched this in less than 24 hours (I skipped scenes that didn\\'t interest me), it\\'s on youtube too so that helped a lot!  I think each ep is only 40 mns if u skip the intro song (it showed lots of spoilers so I recommend skipping it), preview (tip: skip to 160 secs on yt to go straight to the ep!) and the credits! \\n\\nThe story revolved mostly during their time in highschool. Lots of school dramas, as u can imagine: jealousy, love, family, friendship and ofc the infamous asian grade pressuring of parents to their children.\\n\\nThe story after they graduated felt VERY rushed. I wish they could\\'ve presented it in a more elaborate way. The story telling was pretty messy and everything was happening SO FAST. There was a time (I think around ep 17-18) where I was like, wait did i skip an ep??? bc everything was so sudden. \\n\\nFor the characters:\\n\\nXiaoXi. Sigh. Girl, where\\'s the self-respect?? She really didn\\'t know when to distance herself from Jiang Chen. I guess he doesn\\'t mind but it\\'s frustrating for me, a girl viewer, to see someone submitting themselves so much to a guy who barely even shows his real feelings towards her. I get that she\\'s like that at first but during the last legs of the highschool story arc, I was just fed up. She also didn\\'t mature that much when they graduated. Not as annoying but she really does forgive him too easily and when she doesn\\'t, she becomes annoying again by not even listening properly to him and what he has to say. She\\'s cute though and I now stan Shen Yue (the actress). She so smol tho aw\\n\\nJiang Chen. Sigh again. BOI IF U DON\\'T-!!!!! Idk how to feel about his character, he\\'s cold but not too cold. I relate to to him in a way tho, idk how to express feelings properly. I was so annoyed he kept on entertaining Lee Wei but I guess in  the end, she really needed his help. He needed to learn to express his feelings and his motives for the things that he does for XX. I liked tho that he\\'s become open about his feelings for her to his friend. Also, during the times XX and him were together, he was open to doing what she wants eventho he\\'s not a fan of them. He\\'s a tad bit possessive and selfish tho (not that much of a bad thing ;)). I also like his arc as a doctor bc he never neglected his duties. He\\'s given a proper bg story for me to understand why he was the way that he was so I guess I didn\\'t remember much of what annoyed me of his character.\\n\\nWu Bo Song. He\\'s such a sweetheart. A generous, kind and loving sweetheart. I like his story arc as a swimmer. I don\\'t have much to say about him as his character was the typical nice 2nd male lead. We\\'re all used to that. He\\'s the Kin-chan of this story, basically.\\n\\nSecond main couple: their characters were very well written from beginning to end and honestly, they might just be the reason you\\'ll keep on watching. \\n\\nOTP:\\n\\nChemistry was great! The height difference never fail to surprise me whenever I see it lol. \\n\\nSome annoying things abt their relationship: misunderstandings. They literally got separated for a long time just bc there was a misunderstanding (also bc both of then are hardheaded). They never communicate properly (as u do in these stories) that\\'s why they don\\'t meet halfway. It git annoying so I definitely skipped some of those parts. \\n\\nOne thing I liked about their relationship is when he was having his internship/job at the hospital, XX never complained of how him being a doctor gets in the way of their relationship. Whenever he gets a call, she can get upset but still, she understands. That\\'s why she\\'s perfect for him. As for the sweet moments, it takes a while before we get there and there\\'s not much but when there is, it\\'s very very cute!! We should\\'ve gotten a bit more intimate moments, I remember having an ep where they were just acting SO CUTE and next ep was literally hell. One step forward, two step backwards (as u do ofc). It was even worse the second time around. \\n\\nThe ending felt VERY rushed so we didn\\'t get to have enough otp moments. They were very cute tho! Love the scenes on her apartment. He\\'s so into her, it\\'s great. I\\'m getting Scorpio vibes from Jiang Chen, and XiaoXi is the Cancer to his obsessed Scorpio! Lol.\\n\\nFinal thoughts: \\n\\nAll in all, despite my rants above, this was an easy watch! I recommend it bc seems like lots of people liked it too. Many says this is the greatest drama they\\'ve ever watched (which confuses me bc it\\'s pretty average), it\\'s pretty good when you\\'re looking for a lighthearted drama! The otp is so cute!!! I would love to watch them again (I\\'ve known about the \"scandal\" midway through the drama and it did kinda ruin the fantasy for me but i got over it eventually). I\\'ve became a fan of Shen Yue. \\n\\nPs. Hu Yi Tian looks like Park Bo Gum + Sehun in some angles and Shen Yue looks like Mugi Kadowaki + Tsuchiya Tao!',\n",

       "  'Review Text': 'As a huge sucker for high school fluff (although I haven\\'t watched a lot to say I\\'m an expert), I was pretty excited to watch this drama after the hype it received from my facebook timeline. I had already planned to only watch the first episode and delay the next episodes for a week or until I get a little free but it drove me to watch more episodes and I ended up watching it in 2 days, somehow managed to squeeze it in my tight schedule.\\n\\nStarting with the plot, it\\'s not the best but it isn\\'t that bad either. The story started fine but as soon as they graduated from High School, everything felt rushed - it felt like huge chunks of their adulthood were missing. Also, there were too many issues in main protagonists\\' relationship that weren\\'t addressed well or maybe it\\'s because they lacked in communication which is one of the things I disliked in this drama.\\n\\nMoving on to the characters, I honestly loved the chemistry and dynamics of the five main characters. Each of them had their own identity which made their group interesting to watch. However, I didn\\'t like some of their behaviours individually. I don\\'t want to spoil much but I\\'ll take Jiangchen as an example. His anger always leads to bad decisions and at some point, it gets tiring that you start questioning how Xiaoxi was able to tolerate him and like him after all his actions specifically his \"coldness.\" I know it\\'s what makes him Jiangchen but the excitement dies down since you how his choices will widely affect the storyline and where it is heading. Nonetheless, I really liked Jingxiao\\'s and Luyang\\'s character. They made the drama more light-hearted than it was supposed to be. I also have nothing but respect for my hero, Wu Bosong.\\n\\nOverall, A Love So Beautiful is a cute drama. I had problems here and there but after all, I came for the fluff. It did give nostalgic vibes and reminded me of my puppy love days. You surely do everything for the person you like whether it\\'s dumb or not. Happy watching!',\n",

       "  'Review Text': 'Amidst all the positivity and perfection that others see in this drama, you can count on me to be a real grinch and center in on all the reasons that it was not entirely flawless. That is not to say I hated it; far from it, but I fail to share the unwavering, absolute love that many others seem to.\\n\\nMany things about A Love So Beautiful was a surprise to me. I\\'ll be the first to admit that I harbor a real prejudice each time I enter the realm that is a Chinese drama - watching them throughout my childhood, they were unfailingly littered with a) tragedy, b) horrible CG, and/or c) gagworthy storylines (typically, an entertaining combination of all three). And quite honestly, few nowadays seem to impress me. Call it bias, but I still think the Mainland has much to learn regarding what constitutes a good show.\\n\\nA Love So Beautiful was different from the moment I picked it up. It does not present melodramatic conflict for you to brood over, but instead focuses on the innocence of a teenager trying to get through the struggles of school and first love. I did not grow up within the Chinese education system, but there is something incredibly charming and nostalgic about seeing a group of five friends trudge through their high school years. Having teachers scold you, finding unpredictable friendships, secretly liking someone...A person is only naive in such a way for a small amount of time, and this drama perfectly captures that foolish yet heartwarming attitude of youth.\\n\\nIt only helped that the cast consisted of young, yet capable actors. How annoying is it when you watch a show about high school and the actors are in their mid- to late-twenties? And then you spend the entire duration brooding over how old they look and how nothing about them reminds you of a cute teenager. A Love So Beautiful never suffers from this issue; because not only do the main actors look young - they are. They act their parts perfectly, accurately presenting the turbulent feelings of their characters and how they grow over the course of the drama. It\\'s difficult to find five lead actors who interact with one another with so much natural chemistry that it\\'s hard to believe that they\\'re acting.\\n\\nBut turn on the sad music - I\\'m done gushing about all the things I absolutely adored. Here\\'s what dragged it down from a perfect 10: as soon as the characters left high school, the plot began to wander. There is a distinct imbalance between the warmth that is their high school lives and the confusion that is their \"growing up.\" \\n\\nI would like to ensure you that I don\\'t hate the fact that they got older. It was the delivery; how the writers depicted their \"maturing\" that was irksome. What I found particularly problematic was how you spend over half of the drama watching them in high school - and you love it to pieces - but then you have less than eight episodes to watch them speed carelessly through cliche relationship problems and time skips. The transition is rough and the trip doesn\\'t get any smoother. It would have made far more sense to me to either limit the story of this show to their high school years, or add more episodes to spread out their time as they age past university and through adulthood. \\n\\nI simply didn\\'t feel the magic in the latter part of the drama, which follows their post-graduation lives. It\\'s still fine to watch, but it just isn\\'t the same. I wanted to see the ways they carefully sort out problems between themselves and thus mature, not watch as they get angry at one another and resolve it merely because - well, merely because that\\'s the way the writers want it to be. I did not feel as connected to their characters; not because they aren\\'t bubbly teenagers, but because the story slowly becomes more about their problems and less about who they are. To me, their characters are one of the greatest strengths of the plotline, and as it fades throughout, so does the show\\'s primary charm.\\n\\nI would feel bad shutting this drama down entirely, since that would be unfair to the refreshing fun that it brought to me as I marathoned it. It is not without its flaws. However, it made me remember my first feelings of romance and filled my heart to the brim with both happiness and bittersweetness. It\\'s hard to find a drama capable of such an effect on a viewer - and I\\'m glad this one found a way.',\n",

       "  'Review Text': 'This drama is said to be another adaptation of the \"It Started With A Kiss\" franchise. I personally haven\\'t watched any of these except for this version thus I\\'m gonna base my review from this alone without any comparison :D.\\n\\nMost of us have experienced studying in high school. Although not everyone had experiences of relationships in high school, most likely we have observed this happenings around us. \"A Love So Beautiful\" is that drama that highlights the \\xa0innocence of high school as well as the experiences of having a crush or falling in love with someone. This drama has a typical high school drama plot line which focuses on the lives of the main characters during high school. This is another instance wherein a drama doesn\\'t appeal to be deep, but merely to be relatable. I\\'ll delve deeper with this review by discussing each components for rating, from its story until the rewatch value.\\n\\nThe story of this drama is light. It\\'s a story that is easy to digest since the story is told in a linear manner. The pacing was kind of steady but the ratio between the past and present was kind of unsatisfying. I believe that the story would\\'ve been more interesting if it was able to balance the two parts of the story since the character development can be highlighted more in a setting as such. Another characteristic of the story is that it\\'s romantic. But this characteristic is a double edged sword. It was able to create a story that can be fantasized by many but it can create misconceptions in terms its main theme: love. It was my dilemma while watching the drama since at times it challenges my thoughts about relationships.\\n\\nNext is the Acting and the Cast. Personally, this component is the one that made me continue watching the series. It might seem a bit contrary since I only gave it an 8.5 out of 10 but I considered many factors in rating this criteria. The casting for this drama is really great. The chemistry between them is really commendable.\\n\\nShen Yue and Hu Yi Tian\\'s chemistry however, is what made this drama special. It can tug heartstrings and it can make you punch or slap the back of someone who is beside you. If the casting was the only thing to take into consideration in rating, I would\\'ve gave this a perfect rating, but there is a need to rate the acting, thus lowering my score. There are many times while watching that I felt sad because there were many opportunities to show more emotions, to give more adlibs but there wasn\\'t anything. Character relationships aren\\'t even an excuse because the acting could\\'ve been better and sometimes, you feel that the acting is a bit too calculated. The latter lines however, pertains to the acting for the two main actors, Shen Yue and Hu Yi Tian. The acting isn\\'t perfect, nor excellent, but it\\'s still commendable.\\n\\nThe music for this drama is actually good but the thing is, it can only be memorable if you don\\'t skip the opening sequence. The theme songs are beautiful, but I the music lacked variety, thus lowering my score.\\n\\nLastly the rewatch value. I personally think that this drama has a really high rewatch value since it\\'s a light watch and also because of the cast remarkable and memorable chemistry. \\n\\nIt has been a long time since I last watched a Chinese drama and I must day, watching this drama was a good and pleasant experience. I recommend that people to watch this if they want a light and a heartwarming drama :D.',\n",

       "  'Review Text': \"Finished\\xa0A Love so Beautiful in just 2 days, and I am so glad I was able to watch it right as the year ends! This drama really brought my year of 2017 to a happy ending :)\\n\\nStory/plot: -10- I heard that this storyline was very similar to a Japanese drama/manga called “Itazura na Kiss”; however, I have never watched the drama, or any of their remakes, so I am writing this review with nothing to compare it to, pretty much. With that being said, I loved the storyline of this cutesy, heart-warming drama! The cliche style of a not-so-smart girl liking the perfect guy definitely took a positive turn in this show! The transition between high school to college to adult life was pretty smooth, in my opinion, with majority of it focused during their high school years, which made it an innocent and light drama. As the story moves on to the adult life, the relationship between the main leads became more intimate, which made me squeal so many times at 2 o'clock in the morning.\\n\\nActing/cast: -10- The height difference between the 160cm Chen Xiao Xi (played by Shen Yue) and the tall 188cm Jiang Chen (played by Hu Yi Tian) made me squeal every time! Both of the main leads are decently new faces to the entertainment world, and they definitely made a good impression, on me at least haha! For her first main-lead role in a drama, Shen Yue did a spectacular job of performing the different sides and attitudes of the character, Chen Xiao Xi, from the happy, always positive high school youth to the independent grown women that Chen Xiao Xi becomes later on in the drama. NOW, LET’S TALK ABOUT HU YI TIAN! OMG, HE IS SOME HAWT STUFF! So cute, and for his first main-lead role, he played it really well! It’s hard to fall in love with someone who plays a, supposedly, cold-hearted, not caring character, but later on, we find out that the character, Jiang Chen, is pretty much the opposite! The way Hu Yi Tian smirks and acts to care for Chen Xiao Xi in the drama can make any girl's heart flutter! (I think I found my next man crush tbh) The supporting roles might have not done a whole lot, but their contribution played a huge impact throughout the whole show, and it made the drama 100X better! Nothing to complain in general, great leads, great actors/actresses, and great chemistry! :)\\n\\nMusic: -10- The opening song is truly the perfect fit for the drama! When I first heard it, I already loved it and how the melody matches the drama’s theme, but after reading the lyrics, it made me love the song even more! If you don’t believe me, take a look yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIKib5Bymz8 I especially love the line “wo xihuan ni pei wo kanshu fen xin kan wo tou xiao” which translates to “I like you when you’re accompanying me to read a book, distracted by looking at me, smiling quietly,” it brings back many ridiculous smiles when I watched the drama, and I can't seem to stop replaying the song in my head now!\\n\\nRewatch value: -9.5- I love A Love so Beautiful and I have rewatched my favorite parts more than a dozen time, but I am sorry, I can’t rewatch the whole drama from the beginning to end more than once. I am not sure exactly why, but I guess the whole drama wasn’t capturing enough for me? For the parts that I love though, I have rewatched it so many times, and I will never get bored of rewatching them!\\n\\nOverall: -10- This drama truly created a great end to my 2017! The sweet, yet simple story is my cup of tea! I can’t seem to let go of this drama, it was too good and too sweet! The characters played their parts so well, the mixture of the songs and the cute relationships between the characters are too much to be given up so easily. So sad that I watched it in only 2 days! I wish I would have spent more time to savor every second!\\n\\nIf you are looking for a romantic, and heart-warming drama that takes place mainly during the high school life and transitions to more serious matters later on, A Love so Beautiful is definitely the drama for you! Hope this helps and thanks for reading!\\n\\nChào for Now!\\n\\nLily L.\",\n",

       "  'Review Text': 'The only regrets I have with this drama is binge watching it so quickly. Finishing it has left such an empty void in me and I can’t help but make comparisons with any other dramas I watch.\\n\\nThis drama is such a unique case for me because usually I only have interest in Korean dramas and have struggled to enjoy a Chinese drama despite been Chinese myself. I also generally dislike dramas where the female chases after the male. However this drama has a special charm that I am unable to resist, making it probably even my most favourite drama ever in my 4 years of watching Asian dramas.\\n\\nMany people may think of Xiaoxi as a dumb bimbo whose life revolves around a guy and while this may be true we must remember that she is a high school girl and at the time where the desire for romance is very strong.\\xa0She makes mistakes and is most definitely not perfect.\\xa0As the drama progresses, we begin to see her development into an independent lady that is not as easily swayed by Jiangchen until she is treated right. Also she too has her own hobbies and aspirations that do not revolve around Jiangchen which is something that is not commonly shown in dramas with similar themes. No she does not become a nurse for Jiangchen.\\n\\nNONE of the character are perfect. Not even the seemingly perfect Jiangchen whose jealously often gets the better of him and also has his own insecurities just like the next person. \\xa0This makes the drama even more likeable and relatable. They all make mistakes and all learn from it.\\xa0\\n\\nThe drama is a perfect example of taking a very cliche and used plot and twisting it into a unique and charming drama that will remain in our hearts for a very very long time.',\n",

Reviews with a score in the range of 3.0 ~ 6.0 have the lowest positive average compound score, which indicates almost a neutral feeling towards the drama.

       "  'Review Text': \"I was putting off watching this drama for a while. I always saw it under 'top dramas', my recommendation feed, reviews where it was called as another ISWAK/Itazura na Kiss/Playful Kiss, etc.\\n\\nBefore I began watching this I was only familiar with the male lead in a drama where his role wasn't too big. I did know that he is quite decent so decided to go ahead. Here's what I thought finally:\\n\\nSTORY: On the surface it comes off as another youth drama. However what I liked most about the drama was the simplicity of the plot. It's just about a group of friends, an annoying love triangle, a jerk male lead and ditz female lead. I can see the comparisons with ISWAK but nothing tops that. It would be fair to say this was at least inspired from that story. But what sets this drama apart are the likeable characters and the trivial-yet-relatable situations they go through. Their friendship was excellent and it was best part for me over the romantic plot. \\n\\nCHARACTERS AND LOVE TRIANGLE: I had a love-hate relationship with Xiao Xi. She's cute, simple but was too dense for my liking. I also don't like how she seemed not to have any self-respect. I was often uncomfortable with the message this drama keeps giving- it's fine to keep chasing someone even if they walk all over you. Not saying that Jiang Chen didn't like her, but he was mean to her majority of the drama. For me I was all in on the second lead ship. I haven't suffered such major Second Lead Syndrome since AGES. Bo Song deserved Xiao Xi's love. I hated how stone cold she was to him and even seemed ungrateful at times. He did so much for her but she always had one person in her heart. I would blame the writer for this plot because the better moments were written between Xiao Xi and Bo Song. She kept hanging with him till the last 2 episodes, not acknowledging his love. For god's sake, she spent her entire life with a one-sided love and I couldn't buy how she couldn't recognise Bo Song's love throughout regardless of what he said to her. I didn't really buy Jiang Chen as a character, his reason for being mean to her and why he liked her. He just seemed like a selfish person to me who played and manipulated her as he wished. I liked his adult side better because he had at least become more mature and expressive by then. I did enjoy his interactions with Xiao Xi towards the end. The other two friends were awesome and I was glad about having a secondary couple on the show.\\n\\nFLAWS: It was slow, seemed to have borrowed ideas and lack of plot in between episodes. One thing that is rarely explained in Chinese dramas is why the leads fall for each other. In this drama also I had no clue. Especially Xiao Xi's devotion to JC was hard to understand. It was more than just fangirl feelings or puppy love. She was stupid, playful and childish but was bold when it came to pursuing him and had only him in her heart forever.\\n\\nI think this drama is cute if you want to watch something relaxing without much drama. The drama was slow but it was consistent in following its own pacing in all the episodes. Just don't root for the second lead and this drama might just be more enjoyable.\",\n",

This series is quite mild, but the development of everyone\\'s personality and feelings are clearly visible here. One thing I like the most here is the friendship. This series does not recognize the phrase \"love will destroy the friendship\". They still support each other even though the person they like likes someone else. And I really love how that friendship continues to develop until they are grow up.\\n\\nSometimes I feel exasperated by Chen Xiao Xi\\'s childish attitude, but well, maybe when I was in school I did the same thing. LOL. And I really love to see when Jiang Chen feels jealous seeing Chen Xiao Xi and Wu Bo Song\\'s closeness ^_^\\n\\nActing/Cast :\\n\\nThey all did great and so natural, but I especially love Shen Yue acting. She\\'s so cute I can\\'t help it but to adore her ^_^\\n\\nMusic :\\n\\nThe opening and ending song are so easy listening, and I put them both on my Spotify playlist now ^_^\\n\\nRewatch Value :\\n\\nI definitely will watch this series again if I need some cuteness in my life.',\n",

I usually don’t watch Chinese dramas as I think they often overact and can be too cringe but I found this drama extremely fun watching despite the amount of cringy scenes. \\n\\nThe main characters chemistry is so amazing and I think that the love story in the drama is really good and sweet. The main couple is definitely the reason that I kept watching the drama as they show so sincere love. And who doesn’t love a love triangle. \\n\\nThe friendship between the five main characters is what I really liked in the drama. However I do think that the story was too slow in some aspects. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to start watching Chinese dramas.',\n",
