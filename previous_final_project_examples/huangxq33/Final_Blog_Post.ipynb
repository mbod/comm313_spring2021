    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Near the end of 2017, a youth romance drama called *A Love So Beautiful* swept across the Chinese Internet. It tells the love story between a girl named Chen Xiao Xi and a boy named Jiang Chen. They have known each other since childhood and go to the same high school. As a handsome student with good grades, Jiang Chen is popular among the girls in school. Xiao Xi, on the other hand, does not study hard but loves drawing, and she is always so cheerful on expressing her admiration towards Jiang Chen. Jiang Chen seldom shows his affections toward Xiao Xi but often takes care of her. After graduating from high school, they go to the same college studying different majors. As they step into society and start working in different fields, some misunderstandings develop between the two. However, throughout nineteen years, their love and affections towards each other never change. At the end, they both learn to follow their hearts and fall in love with each other. Their high school classmates Lu Yang, Lin Jing Xiao, and Wu Bo Song accompany them throughout the years, too. While providing help and care to Jiang Chen and Xiao Xi, the three also have their love and friendship mingled with those of the couple.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the official account of the drama posted the trailers and posters on Weibo (a Chinese social media platform similar to Twitter), #A Love So Beautiful# and related topics quickly went on the Weibo Hot Search. This Chinese drama was first released on Tencent Video in Mainland China on November 9th, 2017 and finished the last episode on December 7th, 2017. During its broadcasting period, discussions related to the drama spread across various Chinese social media platforms, such as Weibo and a review platform called Douban. There were also mash-up videos of the drama going viral on Bilibili, a video website where users can post their own video productions, including those made with clips from drama series.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was in senior year in high school when *A Love So Beautiful* was being broadcasted. I remember that near the end of my senior year, I heard many classmates talking about this Chinese drama that it for once became a hot topic among certain groups of people in my school. When I posted about this phenomenon on my WeChat Moments, a friend of mine from another high school in Philadelphia commented that many of her friends were also crazy about this drama. As an immigrant student moving to the U.S. from China, I held a notion that Chinese dramas were not popular in the Western Hemisphere, so my U.S. friends' fondness of *A Love So Beautiful* really surprised me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I want to investigate how the English-speaking audience thinks about this popular Chinese drama. To do this, I decide to look at the English reviews for the drama posted in 2017 to 2019 and conduct text analysis on them. What do the viewers focus on when they watch the drama? What impresses them the most? Does the drama receive a good reputation outside of Mainland China?"

    "### Corpus Description\n",
    "\n",
    "To collect reviews for *A Love So Beautiful*, I checked out some review websites and found that Rakuten Viki and MyDramaList both have long reviews that come along with a rating score. Rakuten Viki has more than 10,000 reviews, which makes a good corpus in terms of the number of texts. However, the filtering function of the website does not work well—it includes reviews in languages other than English when I only ask for those in English. In addition, the website address does not change when I navigate to the next page for more reviews, which makes it difficult to use `BeautifulSoup` to conduct web-scraping and collect review data. Therefore, I chose MyDramaList as the source for my corpus. The reviews can be seen by the public without logging in to MyDramaList. The language filtering function also works well, and there is a separate website address for each new page of reviews. `BeautifulSoup` should be able to work well on collecting reviews from this website.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no official information about the drama's release outside of Mainland China, but the earliest review on MyDramaList.com was posted on December 6th, 2017, so we can reasonably assume that audience from outside of Mainland China began to have access to the drama soon after—if not simultaneously with—its original release in Mainland China. For this blog post, I am going to use the reviews from December 2017 to December 2019 for my corpus because a two-year period is a reasonable time range for understanding the performance of a drama series.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collecting the Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I downloaded the HTML for each page of reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, \n",
    "1. Use `requests` to get HTML\n",
    "2. Write the text of response objects to the `data/raw_HTML` folder\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Note: To the day I finished collecting the reviews, there are 9 pages of reviews on MyDramaList.com. Since I sorted the reviews from the most recent, I needed to navigate through all the pages to make sure I get all the older reviews. If new reviews are posted recently, make sure to check how many pages of reviews there are on the website now and change the page range in the code accordingly so that all the older reviews can be collected.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/screenshot_11.png)\n",
    "![](images/screenshot_12.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I extracted the reviews from each downloaded HTML page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four steps need to be done:\n",
    "1. Load the HTML into a `string` object;\n",
    "2. Parse the `string` object into `BeautifulSoup`;\n",
    "3. Find all `<div>` elements that contain reviews;\n",
    "4. Extract the *review text*, *username*, *overall score*, and *date* on which the review was posted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two functions were built to carry out these steps.\n",
    "* `process_html` function - To load the HTML from the files saved earlier and to get a list of `<div class=\"review\">` BeautifulSoup objects\n",
    "* `process_review` function - To take a BeautifulSoup object for the `<div class=\"review\">` and to return a dictionary that contains the *review text*, *username*, *overall score*, and *date*\n",

    "![](images/pro_rev.png)\n",
    "![](images/screenshot_13.png)\n",
    "![](images/review_data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To this day, there are 107 English reviews on MyDramaList.com; each review comes along with an overall score for the drama, and the username of the reviewer and the date of which the review was posted were also displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/screenshot_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/screenshot_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the 107 reviews, seven were posted in 2020, which are out of the time range I am interested in. I will disregard these seven reviews and only analyze the rest 100 reviews posted from 2017 to 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I have a list of reviews; each review is a dictionary that has four keys:\n",
    "1. Date\n",
    "2. Overall Score\n",
    "3. Review Text\n",
    "4. Username\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how the dictionary looks like.\n",

    "\n",
    "I organized the review data in two ways:\n",
    "1. by `date`\n",
    "2. by `overall score`\n",
    "\n",
    "These are also the two key dimensions of my analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the \"date\" dimension, I separated the reviews by year.\n",
    "* 18 reviews from 2017\n",
    "* 58 reviews from 2018\n",
    "* 24 reviews from 2019\n",

    "![](images/screenshot_5.png)\n",
    "![](images/screenshot_6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the \"overall score\" dimension, I separated the reviews by the overall score given by the reviewer.\n",
    "* 0 reviews with a score between 0 to 3.0 -- these scores mean the drama is \"poor\"\n",
    "* 7 reviews with a score between 3.0 to 6.0 -- these scores mean the drama is \"so-so\"\n",
    "* 13 reviews with a score between 6.0 to 8.0 -- these scores mean the drama is \"good\"\n",
    "* 80 reviews with a score between 8.0 to 10.0 -- these scores mean the drama is \"excellent\"\n",

    "### Approach to Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We have learned several kinds of text analysis in class. For my research question, I think conducting **word and phrase frequency analysis**, **concordance analysis**, and **sentiment analysis** on the reviews would be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In writings, words and phrases can reveal a lot about the writers, for example, their vocabulary levels, their personal thoughts, and their stances. Creating a word or phrase frequency list from reviews can provide an idea on what the viewers focus on or what impresses them the most when they watch the drama series. What aspect of the drama catches their attention? Does the drama remind them of their own experiences?\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a further step from word and phrase frequency analysis, concordance analysis allows me to look into details of the reviews and analyze the words of my interest. By investigating a word in context, I can discover and summarize patterns used with the word and discover meaning in these patterns. For example, interpreting the usage of a word in the reviews can help me understand what the reviewers are referring to with this specific word and why that might be important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, conducting sentiment analysis is a good idea because I want to know the attitudes of the English-speaking audience towards the drama and whether or not the drama gains a good reputation in regions other than Mainland China. Sentiment analysis can quantify the types and degree of emotions that are expressed in the text. For example, if the result of the sentiment analysis shows that a review conveys positive/negative sentiments, I may be able to infer that the reviewer likes/dislikes or recommends/does not recommend the drama series."

    "### Analyzing the Corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "### I. Word and Phrase Frequency Analysis\n",
    "#### A. Analyzing Reviews from 2017\n",
    "##### 1. Word frequency list\n",
    "\n",
    "First, extract the review text from each dictionary in the list `reviews_2017` (loaded from the JSON file that holds the list `review_2017`) and put the review texts into a list called `review_texts_2017`. Then, we need to 1) loop over the list of review texts from 2017, 2) tokenize the text using the `tokenize` function and turning the letters to lowercase and removing certain punctuations, and 3) update the frequency list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the word frequency list showing the 50 most common words in the review texts from 2017. In each tuple, the number of occurrence is shown along with the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/word_freq_2017.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**A few observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Function words like *`the`*, *`and`*, *`to`*, and *`a`* appear frequently in the reviews. Other words worthy of attention are *`i`*, *`my`*, and *`me`*. Reviewers refer to themselves very often in their reviews, probably to express their feelings and address their opinions about the drama.\n",
    "* The words *`cute`* and *`beautiful`* are among the 50 most frequent words. The reviewers might use *`cute`* to describe the story plot or the characters, but *`beautiful`* might more likely be used to describe a character or a specific scene. It might also be possible that they use the word *`beautiful`* frequently because they mention the name of the drama (which contains the word *`beautiful`*) very often in their reviews.\n",
    "* Another word that appears frequently is *`school`*. Most parts of the story plot take place in school, so it makes sense that reviewers mention school in their reviews. But which school are they referring to? The \"school\" in the drama or the \"school\" in the reviewer's actual life?\n",
    "* Ranking the 49th place is the word *`chen`*. An interesting fact about *`chen`* is that it is the last name of the female lead character and also the first name of the male lead character, so the word frequency list cannot really tell us which specific character the reviewers frequently write about, or whether or not the reviewers mention both lead characters together.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Bigram frequency list and trigram frequency list\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we create a bigram frequency list and a trigram frequency list, we need to use the `get_ngram_tokens` function to tokenize the review texts. Instead of having one word as one token, this function makes two words (bigram, where n=2) or three words (trigram, where n=3) as one token. Then, we can create a bigram frequency list (`review_texts_2017_bigram_dist`) and a trigram frequency list (`review_texts_2017_trigram_dist`).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/bi_tri_freq_2017.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**A few observations**\n",
    "* The phrase *`high school`* occurs 27 times and ranks the 4th in the bigram frequency list. Notice also that phrases like *`high school life`* and *`high school years`* also appear in the most common 50 trigrams list. The drama probably reminds many viewers about their times in high school.\n",
    "* In the bigram frequency list, we can see that the male lead character's name *`jiang chen`* appears 12 times, and the female lead character's name *`xiao xi`* appears 9 times. If we look at the trigram frequency list, some reviewers write the full name of the female lead character *`chen xiao xi`* in their reviews. This probably explains why *`chen`* appears frequently. And the number of occurrence of each name also suggests that there is not a big difference in how often the reviewers talk about the male lead character and the female lead character.\n",
    "* A little surprise is the phrase *`the music`*, which is among the 50 most common bigrams. This shows that when people watch a drama, they not only focus on the story, sometimes they pay attention to the music, too."

    "\n",
    "![](images/word_freq_2018.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**A few observations**\n",
    "* Besides some function words (e.g., *`the`*, *`and`*, *`a`*, *`to`*, *`of`*, etc.), the words *`i`*, *`it`*, *`this`*, and *`drama`* are among the top 10 words that appear the most in the review texts.\n",
    "    * When the reviewers are writing a review for a drama, they are likely to often refer to themselves and talk about their personal feelings or engagement with the drama, so the word *`i`* occurs a lot in the review text.\n",
    "    * Similarly, since they are writing about a drama, they would keep referring to the drama, too. This might explain the frequent occurrence of the words *`it`*, *`this`*, and *`drama`*.\n",
    "* The word *`love`* ranks the 17th. This is reasonable since the drama is about puppy love and might trigger the reviewers to talk about love -- either their own love stories or the love stories in the drama.\n",
    "* The word *`school`* occurs 57 times. The drama has a setting in school, which might remind the reviewers of their youth memories in school.\n",
    "* The word *`cute`* occurs 54 times. It is very likely to be the word that the reviewers would use to describe the story or the characters in the drama.\n",
    "* One word that worths paying attention to, again, is *`chen`*. This is the last name of the female lead character; it is also the first name of the male lead character. It is common that the reviews mention about the characters, but in this case, the problem with the one-word frequency list is that we would not know which character the *`chen`* is referring to. So it might be a good idea to look at a bigram frequency list or even a trigram frequency list.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Bigram frequency list and trigram frequency list\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/bi_tri_freq_2018.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**A few observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The bigram *`jiang chen`* ranks the third in the bigram frequency list! This is the full name of the male lead character. The bigram *`xiao xi`* ranks the 17th. This is the first name of the female lead character. The occurrence of *`jiang chen`* is almost twice of that of *`xiao xi`*. But notice that there is a bigram *`female lead`* that occurs 19 times. If we take this 19 times into account for *`xiao xi`* when we consider the number of times that the reviews mention about the two lead characters, there isn't a big difference between the two. The reviewers do not seem to prefer writing about one more than the other in their reviews.\n",
    "* The bigram *`high school`* appears 37 times. This suggests that high school as the setting actually leaves an impression among the audience, probably because it is a place where many people can relate to especially when it mingles with love stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "* More names! The trigram *`hu yi tian`* is the name of the actor who plays *`jiang chen`*. It appears 8 times. Interestingly, one cannot find the name of the actress who plays *`xiao xi`* in the frequency list showing the top 50 bigrams or trigrams. Actually, the actress who plays *`xiao xi`* is Shen Yue; we would look into the bigram frequency list to find her name. In fact, the bigram *`shen yue`* occurs 12 times, though it is not in the top 50. Reviewers usually write about the characters because they are the ones directly related to the drama. But sometimes, they also write about the actors or actresses. For example, they might discuss the acting skills or the appearance of these actors and actresses.\n",
    "* Reviewers did not forget about the second male lead character, whose name *`wu bo song`* occurs 7 times in the reviews. Though much fewer times of mentioning compared to those of *`xiao xi`* and *`jiang chen`*, it shows that *`wu bo song`* also plays an impressive role and is worthy of audience discussion.\n",
    "* Notice the trigrams like *`jiang chen and`*, *`and xiao xi`*, *`chen and xiao`*, and *`xiao xi and`*. Audience in fact often talk about the two main characters together.\n",
    "* One interesting trigram is *`the chemistry between`*. When people talk about love, they often use the word \"chemistry\" when they describe the interactions between the couple -- this applies to their discussion of the couples in drama as well."

Generally, there is not a big difference between the numbers of occurrence of the male lead character and the female lead character, but reviewers from 2019 seem to talk more often about the male lead character. Besides the plot and the characters, some reviewers also talk about the music of the drama.

    "Though word and phrase frequency analysis can give us a general idea of what the reviewers cover in their reviews, it cannot provide more detailed information about the reviewers' thoughts about the drama. For example, we see words such as *`school`* and *`cute`* that show up very often in the reviews, but we cannot tell from the frequency list that in what contexts these words appear and how these words are used. So for the next part, I am going to choose a word of interest from the word frequency list for each year and use concordance analysis to take a closer look at them. By investigating a specific word in context, we can summarize certain patterns used with the word and discover meaning in these patterns.\n",

    "\n",
    "By conducting word and phrase frequency analysis, concordance analysis, and sentiment analysis on the MyDramaList reviews posted from 2017 to 2019 for the Chinese drama series *A Love so Beautiful*, we learn that the audience focus on various aspects when they watch a drama. For example, they pay attention to the plot, the setting, the characters, and even the music. We also see that different reviewers might use the same word in their reviews for different purposes: to refer to the elements in the drama or to something related to but not directly involved in the drama, to describe the story plot, and to describe the characters. The sentiment analysis reveals a potential phenomenon of drama-watching -- the audience may like the drama better when it is on air or recently finished, but such interest of the audience in the drama may decrease as the drama has ended and as time passes. Nevertheless, the general result of sentiment analysis suggests a similar attitude to what the website rating suggests, which is that the drama actually receives a good reputation among the English-speaking audience outside of Mainland China.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some limitations of this project. For example, MyDramaList.com has only 100 reviews posted in the time range from 2017 to 2019, which yields a small corpus; because of some technical issues, I did not use Rakuten Viki as my source for collecting reviews, which could have provided me a corpus of a larger size and might be useful when conducting the word and phrase frequency analysis and the concordance analysis since there would be a greater number of texts. Another limitation is that I did not look into other dimensions (e.g., emotion and arousal) of sentiment analysis, which might provide interesting insights into the reviewers' thoughts and opinions about the drama. It would also be a good idea to take a closer look at the specific words that yield a certain score in sentiment analysis. Since these are not within the range of my research question, I did not include them, but a project that examines these aspects would also be interesting."
