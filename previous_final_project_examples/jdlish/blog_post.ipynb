    "# Introduction\n",
    "***\n",
    "### While the novel coronavirus spread around the world, ravaging healthcare systems, economies, and daily living, most Americans turned to popular media outlets to garner live updates and information about the mysterious virus. With so much unknown about the virus, from how it spreads to whether people can develop immunity, these media outlets have become vital sources of coronavirus coverage, providing all of the information people need to form opinions about its severity, spread, and how they should act in response. The news and media outlets are always on and people are always watching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Since the 2016 election, the mainstream media has become highly politically polarized. Fox and CNN are two news outlets that have positioned themselves in opposite political spheres and are representative of this polarization. For example, Pew Data has shown that 75% of conservative republicans say that Fox is their main source of information. CNN and Fox are also two of the most watched news outlets in the U.S. for coronavirus coverage; both CNN and Fox have had between 2-5 million daily viewers. Given the increased attention placed on these news outlets during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as their starkly differing political affiliations, it is understandable that they would report coronavirus news differently, and that each of their viewers would therefore develop different opinions and viewpoints about the virus, its spread, and its severity. Recently, studies have been published that delve into this. For example, in April, a Pew Poll was published that highlighted differences in viewer responses to the coronavirus between different politically leaning news outlets. One thing the poll was found was that 80% of Fox News viewers believed that the media exaggerated the threat from coronavirus compared to 54% of CNN viewers. While this highlights how viewers of different politically leaning news outlets have formed different opinions and beliefs about the coronavirus, studies haven’t yet delved into the exact causes of these differing viewer reactions. Have these different politically leaning news outlets differed in their responses to the coronavirus? If so, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "### I aimed to investigate this, by studying CNN and Fox news transcripts containing coronavirus coverage, and searching for linguistic differences between the two popular and different politically leaning news outlets. This would enable me to paint a picture of how CNN and Fox have differed in their coronavirus responses, and thus shed light on what may have caused differing viewer reactions to the coronavirus coverage of the different politically leaning news outlets."

    "# Data Collection\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### The news transcript data for both CNN and Fox that I required was obtained from Lexis Nexis, an online library database that stores comprehensive news content, including news transcripts for all the major news outlets. I culled Fox and CNN news transcripts from January to the second week in April that contained the words ‘coronavirus’, ‘pandemic’, and/or ‘covid19.’ This provided me with almost 2,000 CNN and over 450 Fox news transcripts containing coronavirus coverage. Because news broadcasts tend to cover many different topics and contain tangents and side conversations between news anchors, I filtered each news transcript down to only the parts that directly addressed coronavirus and the above key words specifically. Doing this enabled me to create an accurate representation of each news transcript’s coronavirus coverage and response, by focusing directly on the areas of each news transcript that mentioned coronavirus."

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "### It appears that CNN began to report about coronavirus on January 18th, and Fox began to report about the coronavirus on January 22nd. \n",
    "\n",
    "### It also appears that CNN has been reporting about coronavirus much more than Fox has over time. CNN's daily number of news broadcasts covering coronavirus started at around 5 per day in January, and increased over time to range between approximately 15 per day to 40 per day. Fox's daily number of news broadcasts covering coronavirus hovered between approximately 0 and 5 per day between January and February, before increasing to a range between approximately 5-10 per day. CNN has had many more daily news broadcasts containing coronavirus coverage than Fox has each day over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next, I wanted to assess differences between Fox and CNN coronavirus responses. Specifically, I analyzed differences in sentiment, messaging, and word choice, three key elements that could shape Fox and CNN coronavirus responses, and provide evidence to explain differences between each of their viewers' reactions to the coronavirus pandemic."

    "## CNN and Fox Coronavirus Response Sentiment \n",
    "***\n",
    "### Sentiment Analysis is a broad term used to describe natural language processing approaches used to quantify the types and degree of emotions expressed in text. Emotion, particularly the balance of negative and positive emotion, is a key element of a response to an event/topic. Two news outlets covering the same news topic may convey similar information with different emotion, and this ultimately can create major differences between the resulting emotions their viewers adopt themselves towards that topic. Additionally, different emotions may indicate that the two sources convey different content and information altogether while reporting on a given topic. Thus, conducting sentiment analysis on both Fox and CNN news broadcasts covering the coronavirus, analyzing sentiment trends over time, and comparing the results between the two news outlets, can reveal important differences between their overall responses to the coronavirus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I used Valence Aware Dictionary and sentiment Reasoner (VADER), a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. Specifically, I used a VADER algorithm to give each news transcript a compound sentiment score, ranging between -1 to 1, which represents the overall positive or negative direction and magnitude of the emotions of the text. I then created a sentiment score time series for both Fox and CNN as shown below, in order to observe differences in both the magnitudes and trajectories of the sentiment scores of their news transcripts over time.\n",

    "### First, I found the average sentiment score of both Fox and CNN coronavirus responses between January and April. Despite coronavirus news broadcasts feeling very negative, both Fox and CNN appear to have sentiment scores that are only slightly negative on average, with Fox news transcripts being slightly more negative on average than CNN news transcripts (-0.18 vs. -0.09 average sentiment score). \n",
    "\n",
    "### As shown above, it appears that the sentiment of Fox news transcripts is more inconsistent compared with that of CNN news transcripts; Fox's daily news transcript sentiment varies much more than that of CNN's between January and April. In fact the average standard deviation of the daily sentiment scores of Fox and CNN are 0.275 and 0.199 respectively; there appears to be a meaningful difference between the standard deviations of the news outlets' sentiment. Inconsistency in sentiment could confuse viewers, and muddle the overall effectiveness and quality of a news outlet's response to a given topic. This data could indicate that Fox’s overall response to coronavirus has been all over the place/inconsistent relative to CNN’s. However, in order to support a broader conclusion like this, additional analyses delving into the consistency of each news outlet’s coronavirus response needed to be conducted.\n"

    "## CNN and Fox Coronavirus Response VAD Consistency\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Several influential factor analysis studies have shown that the primary dimensions of word meaning are valence, arousal, and dominance (VAD). Thus, analyzing the VAD scores of the news broadcasts of both Fox and CNN over time could provide another dimension to make conclusions about the consistency of the overall sentiment and response of each of the news outlet's news broadcasts surrounding the coronavirus. To do this, I plotted VAD over time for each news outlet at the daily level as shown below. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<img src='images/figures/daily_cnn_VAD.png' width='1000'>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<img src='images/figures/daily_fox_VAD.png' width='1000'>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looking at the daily news broadcast VAD scores of each news outlet reveals that the overall variance of each component of VAD between the news outlets over time appears to be different. CNN's VAD scores appear to have a lower overall range and variance over time compared with those of Fox. These results appear to support the findings revealed in the sentiment analysis conducted above; both the compound sentiment and VAD of Fox's response to the coronavirus over time appear to be inconsistent and all over the place compared with those of CNN's response to the coronavirus. It is important to note that, as shown below, on average each component of VAD between the news outlets appears to be similar, consistent with the aforementioned sentiment scores. \n",

    "<img src='images/figures/fox_VAD_avg.png' width='500'>\n",
    "\n",
    "### While sentiment and VAD trends are important for drawing insights about the overall responses of Fox and CNN to coronavirus, messaging itself is a very important component as well, consisting of the content, vocabulary, and phraseology used to convey information over time. Given this, and that on average it appears that the differences between the VAD and sentiment scores of the news outlets are small, in order to bolster support for the above findings related to response consistency, analyzing messaging consistency is important. Messaging analysis could also help reveal information about how exactly Fox and CNN differ in their response consistency, and why this might be. "

Their response has contained significantly more coverage of the number of deaths in the U.S., the symptoms patients have suffered from, the number of confirmed cases, and the evolution of testing in the U.S. compared with Fox's response. Fox appears to have focused its messaging around China, focusing its coverage around both the country and Chinese people much more than CNN has. Fox mentions China significantly more than it mentions America (362 times versus 127 times), and mentions Chinese more than it mentions America as well (183 times versus 127 times). Fox mentions the words China and Chinese significantly more than CNN does. Moreover, it appears that Fox has made its messaging significantly more political than CNN has. Fox has mentioned the words democrats and Biden a total of 166 times which is not only significantly more than CNN has mentioned them, but is also more than Fox has mentioned America (127 times). Moreover, Fox appears to have focused a lot more attention around the response to coronavirus than CNN has.

The results of the model and its quality can be found below.\n",

    "### From my logistic regression results shown above, I was able to create a classifier that is able to distinguish between Fox and CNN news transcripts with a 75% accuracy. The quality of my logistic regression is further bolstered by the output of a classification report above which shows high precision and recall scores (75% average each), two additional metrics which show classification model performance and quality. These values are much higher than what one would expect under random guessing (approximately 50%). These results indicate the following:\n",

    "<li>Logistic Regression helped to confirm the results of Keyness Analysis by revealing many of the same words which Fox or CNN use significantly more relative to one another. For example, Keyness Analysis showed that CNN uses the words 'outbreak' and 'confirmed' significantly more than Fox does. Keyness Analysis also showed that Fox uses the word 'covid19' significantly more than CNN does. This was all confirmed by the logistic regression I created, which showed that these words are very important at distinguishing between the news outlets' responses at a 99% significance threshold.</li>\n",

    "### Fox and CNN coronavirus responses differ in their consistency, word choice, and messaging focus. Consistency, along the lines of overall sentiment, VAD, and messaging, is lacking in Fox’s coronavirus response compared with CNN’s. CNN and Fox also differ significantly in their word choice as shown by both Keyness Analysis and Logistic Regression, and this has contributed to significant differences in coronavirus response messaging focus between the news outlets. The evidence produced above could help to explain why Fox and CNN viewers have adopted different behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes towards the coronavirus; if CNN and Fox viewers hear different responses to the coronavirus in sentiment, VAD, and messaging focus, it is not surprising they would develop starkly different outlooks on the coronavirus pandemic. This could also help to explain why coronavirus has become a political issue instead of a bipartisan response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If we are going to overcome the challenges and issues brought about by the coronavirus pandemic, we need to take a unified outlook and approach in both our behaviors and beliefs. However, if this is to occur, CNN and Fox must band together to provide the general public with consistent and reliable coronavirus responses and throw aside their political differences. Only coordinated efforts to combat the coronavirus and its spread will be successful. \n"
