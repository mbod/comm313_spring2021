    "### Key word in context (KWIC) analysis might give a sense of the consistency of the messaging surrounding the word 'coronavirus' between Fox's and CNN's news broadcasts. I analyzed a random sample of 10 KWICs for each news outlet in both February and April, where each KWIC centers around the word coronavirus, and contains the 10 words before and 10 words after the word 'coronavirus.' By analyzing February and April as well as February vs. April KWICs for each news outlet, I will be able to assess how consistent each news outlet's coronanvirus response/messaging varies within the same month as well as over time. I hypothesized that Fox's messaging/response would be inconsistent in both February and April and over time, in line with their more inconsistent sentiment revealed through sentiment analysis and VAD analysis above. I also hypothesized that CNN's messaging/response would be more consistent in both February and April and over time, which would be consistent with what CNN's sentiment appears to have revealed from sentiment and VAD analysis above. If my hypotheses are correct, then it would provide additional evidence to support the conclusion that Fox and CNN differ in the consistency of their coronavrus responses, with evidence from both messaging and sentiment.
