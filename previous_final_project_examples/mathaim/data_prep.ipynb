EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Today I’d like to provide you with an update in our war against the coronavirus.\\xa0 Thanks to our comprehensive strategy and extraordinary devotion to our citizens — we’ve had such tremendous support all over — we continue to see encouraging signs of progress.\\n\\nCases in New York area, New Orleans, Detroit, Boston, and Houston are declining.\\xa0 Denver, Seattle, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Nashville, Indianapolis, and St. Louis are all stable and declining.\\xa0 All parts of the country are either in good shape, getting better.\\xa0 In all cases, getting better.\\xa0 And we’re seeing very little that we’re going to look at as a superseding hotspot.\\xa0 Things are moving along.\\xa0 Really, a horrible situation that we’ve been confronted with, but they’re moving along.\\n\\nAs we express our gratitude for these hard-fought gains, however, we continue to mourn with thousands of families across the country whose loved ones have been stolen from us by the invisible enemy.\\xa0 We grieve by their side as one family — this great American family.\\xa0 And we do grieve.\\n\\nWe also stand in solidarity with the thousands of Americans who are ill and waging a brave fight against the virus.\\xa0 We’re doing everything in our power to heal the sick and to gradually re-open our nation, and to safely get our people back to work.\\xa0 They want to get back to work, and they want to get back to work soon.\\xa0 There’s a hunger for getting our country back, and it’s happening, and it’s happening faster than people would think.\\n\\nEnsuring the health of our economy is vital to ensuring the health of our nation.\\xa0 These goals work in tandem.\\xa0 They work side by side.\\n\\nIt’s clear that our aggressive strategy to slow the spread has been working and is saving countless lives.\\xa0 For those who are infected, we have taken unprecedented action to ensure they have the highest level of care anywhere in the world.\\xa0 The federal government has built more than 11,000 extra beds, shipped or delivered hundreds of millions of pieces of personal protective equipment, as you know — in fact, some of the people here are going to be talking about it; some of our greatest executives — some of the greatest anywhere in the world — and distributed over 10,000 ventilators.\\n\\nAnd we now have, in a very short period of time — many have been delivered, and hundreds of thousands are being built.\\xa0 And frankly, every governor has more ventilators right now than they know what to do with.\\xa0 They’re actually shipping them to different locations, and we’re shipping some to our allies and others throughout the world, because we have ventilators like — the job that they’ve done in getting this very complex piece of equipment built is actually incredible.\\xa0 You don’t hear about ventilators anymore except in a positive way.\\n\\nWe’ve launched the most ambitious testing effort, likewise, on Earth.\\xa0 The United States has now conducted more than 5.4 million tests — nearly double the number tested in any other country.\\xa0 More than twice as much as any other country.\\xa0 Think of that.\\n\\nMoments ago, I came from a meeting with some of our nation’s largest retailers, including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, and Kroger.\\xa0 We’re joined by leaders of those great companies.\\xa0 And we also have with us the leaders from the world’s top medical diagnostics companies and suppliers: Thermo Fisher, LabCorp, Quest, U.S. Cotton, and the American Clinical Laboratory Association.\\xa0 These are great — great companies.\\n\\nThese private-sector leaders, along with others such as Roche, Abbott, Becton Dickinson, Hologic, and Cephe– Cepheid, have been exceptional partners in an unprecedented drive to expand the states’ capabilities and our country’s capabilities.\\xa0 The job they’ve done has been incredible.\\xa0 The testing that’s been developed and being developed right now has been truly an amazing thing.\\n\\nI want to thank Abbott Laboratories for the job they’ve done.\\xa0 I want to thank Roche.\\xa0 And in particular, those two have really stepped forward.\\xa0 Abbott with a five-minute test that people can take, and in five minutes they know what the — what the answer is.\\n\\nI’d like to ask, if I could, the executives of these great companies — and they are — they have really helped us a lot over the last 45-day period.\\xa0 We’re talking about a 45-day period when many of us met.\\xa0 And since then, what Walmart and the others have done has been nothing short of amazing.\\n\\nSo I just want to ask them to come forward and say a few words about their company.\\xa0 Plus, they’re going to make a big contribution to our country.\\n\\nPlease.\\xa0 Come forward, please.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nMR. RUSCKOWSKI:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for — all of you for being here today.\\xa0 And what we’d like to talk about is the progress we’ve made.\\n\\nThe last time we were here was March 13th, and we’ve made tremendous progress.\\xa0 And none of that progress could be made without the 47,000 people at Quest Diagnostics that are working around the clock, working up the test and running the test and delivering the results that we need.\\n\\nAs far as results, we’ve made tremendous progress.\\xa0 We are currently, at Quest Diagnostics, testing about 50,000 tests per day.\\xa0 We’ve been pushed by the task force to bring up that number by the end of May.\\xa0 We’ll have 100,000 tests per day — about 3 million tests — and these are the molecular tests that we do today.\\n\\nWe have also brought up serological testing.\\xa0 We started that this past week, and by the end of May, we’ll be close to 250,000 a day, about 7,000 a month.\\xa0 So you put those two numbers together, and it’s about 10 million tests by the end of May that we’ll be doing at Quest Diagnostics.\\n\\nWe’re doing that also in a quicker way.\\xa0 Turnaround times were somewhat of an issue in the early days.\\xa0 We’ve reduced that to one to two days.\\xa0 Our turnaround time for people in beds — hospital beds — is less than 24 hours.\\xa0 And we’re doing that in the same way we’ve done it with the FDA and with CLIA, delivering the quality that you all expect.\\xa0 And convenience will improve, as well, with convenient solutions that we’ll be able to swab individuals more easily and also deliver to consumer — the ability to have consumers choose a test online with a telehealth provider.\\n\\nSo with that, I’d like to offer my colleague the podium as well.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nMR. SCHECHTER:\\xa0 Mr. President, thank you very much for your leadership and for having us all here today.\\xa0 Our scientists and our lab technicians are working day and night in order to do as many tests as we possibly can for the American public and to turn those tests around as quickly as possible.\\n\\nJust 45 days ago, we said we could do several thousand tests a day.\\xa0 We can now do 60,000 tests a day, and we’re continuing to expand that capacity every single day.\\n\\nIn addition, our scientists are working to make testing more convenient and easier.\\xa0 We have the swabs now that are much smaller than the original ones that we originally launched with, but we also have the Pixel by LabCorp at-home test.\\xa0 That test, right now, is for healthcare workers on the frontline and first responders, but we will be rolling that out much more broadly over the coming weeks, and we’re going to roll it out with absolutely no upfront cost for the individual consumers.\\n\\nAt the same time, we are building our capacity for serology testing, and we can currently do about 50,000 today, and we’ll be able to do several hundred thousand per day by the middle of May.\\xa0 And we’re going to be working with the retailers — our colleagues that are here today — to help them as they expand their testing capabilities across the entire country.\\n\\nAnd lastly, Mr. President, we have a rather large drug development business, and we will continue to work with our colleagues in the pharmaceutical and the biotech — biotechnology industry to ensure we do everything we possibly can to enroll clinical trials fast so that we can get new treatments and potential vaccines.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Please, go ahead.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nMR. CASPER:\\xa0 Mr. President, thank you and thank — and thank the administration for all of the collaboration to enable Thermo Fisher Scientific to be able to produce the test kits that companies like LabCorp and Quest and the public health labs around the world run.\\n\\nWe met our original commitments of producing 5 million kits a week, and we’re up to scaling that to double that in the coming weeks in terms of supporting testing around the world.\\n\\nI’d like to thank my 75,000 colleagues around the world for their tireless effort to make that a reality and supporting all of — all of our customers to have the testing necessary to get America back to work.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Great job.\\n\\nMR. NIMS:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 I’m John Nims with U.S. Cotton, and we are the company that is going to produce the swabs to be used in these testing kits.\\xa0 We have about 1,200 people in our company.\\xa0 And in our Cleveland operation, they have pivoted from, as you’ve said, the Q-tip-style swab to a swab that’s going to have a plastic stick with a polyester tip so that they can be assembled into these kits.\\n\\nOur Cleveland team has done a wonderful job with this, and I’m very — they’re very excited to be able to help in this effort.\\n\\nSo thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Great job.\\n\\nMR. MERLO:\\xa0 Mr. President, thank you.\\xa0 I’m Larry Merlo with CVS Health.\\xa0 And it was just over a month ago that we opened up our first drive-through test site.\\xa0 And since that time, we have opened large-scale testing facilities across five states in partnership with the administration and working with the governors of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Georgia, and Michigan.\\n\\nAnd these sites are enabling us to test approximately 1,000 individuals a day with real-time results.\\xa0 We now have a capacity to test about 35,000 individuals each week.\\xa0 And this afternoon, we announced plans to expand that capacity even further.\\n\\nBeginning in May, we will install testing capabilities in up to 1,000 CVS pharmacies.\\xa0 We’ll be using our drive-throughs and our parking lots with swab testing.\\xa0 So again, you’ll see that coming online, you know, in May.\\n\\nAnd we also recognize the fact that the virus is disproportionately affecting our minority communities.\\xa0 So we’re working in partnership with organizations like the National Medical Association to bring testing and care into the traditionally underserved communities.\\n\\nWe’re also beginning to implement mobile capabilities with which to do that.\\xa0 And as businesses are restarting their workforce, we’ll also be looking to assist them, you know, as they begin to come back to a normal operation.\\n\\nAnd finally, as my other colleagues, I just want to thank my CVS colleagues.\\xa0 They have done a phenomenal job in terms of helping people in many different ways all across communities in the country.\\xa0 And they’re part of this army of healthcare professionals and, you know, front-store and, you know, first-line supervisors and workers that are doing terrific things to bring our country together.\\xa0 And, for that, we owe them a huge amount of gratitude.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Great job.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nMR. ASHWORTH:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Appreciate the invitation to be here today.\\xa0 And it was just 45 days ago when we were here.\\xa0 I’m Richard Ashworth.\\xa0 I oversee Walgreens in the U.S.\\xa0 And I just want to start off — Larry, like you — thanking the over 200,000 Walgreen team members who are in stores every day all across America, taking care of our patients and our customers — you know, giving them essential daily needs; the prescriptions, obviously, that they need; and even COVID testing while we’re here.\\n\\nWe also announced today we’ll be expanding our testing capabilities across all states, including Puerto Rico.\\xa0 We’ll be able to triple the volume that we do now, in partnership with our lab partners, and we’re excited to be able to do that.\\n\\nWe’re really excited with the public-private partnership that we have here, because that’s what’s enabling us to do this, and we look forward to working with the additional states to get these sites up and running as fast as possible.\\n\\nAs a pharmacist, I just want to say one quick thing: I’m really proud to be part of this profession.\\xa0 And not just Walgreens pharmacists and pharmacy employees, but all of them, across grocery — mass, independents.\\xa0 You’re really doing what you should be doing and what you went to school for: to help patients, counseling them on their medicines, and helping them understand the problems that we’re facing.\\n\\nYou know, pharmacy is right here in it with everyone, together in the community, and we look forward to being part of the testing like we are now; serology, whatever that might look like in the future; and eventually treatment when the vaccine does come.\\n\\nSo thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Great job.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\n\\nMR. ASHWORTH:\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nMR. MCMULLEN:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr.\\xa0President.\\xa0 Thank you, Mr.\\xa0Vice President.\\xa0 We appreciate all you’re doing to get America back to work and doing it safely.\\n\\nI represent Kroger, and my name is Rodney McMullen, and I am so proud of our nearly half a million associates that are doing everything, every day, to keep customers safe and our associates safe.\\n\\nAnd one of the things that we were able to do is provide the basic practices we’re doing.\\xa0 We call it “blueprint.”\\xa0 And it’s the things that all of us can learn from on how to get America back working.\\n\\nWe also announced earlier today, continuing to accelerate our practice on testing.\\xa0 We are actively engaged in six states.\\xa0 Next — in the next couple of weeks, we’ll take that to 12 states, and the number of tests that we do continues to grow faster than that.\\n\\nTogether, we will win.\\xa0 Together, we will solve this problem and move on.\\xa0 America is always great.\\xa0 Thank you again.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nMR. MCMILLON:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr.\\xa0President.\\xa0 My name is Doug McMillon.\\xa0 I’m a Walmart associate.\\xa0 And I too would like to start by thanking our associates for everything that they’re doing in our stores, Sam’s Clubs, distribution centers, and in our e-commerce fulfillment centers.\\xa0 They’ve been inspiring and continue to have a can-do attitude and step up.\\xa0 It’s much appreciated.\\n\\nWe started 45 days ago, as did everyone else, and we’ve been operating sites for a while now.\\xa0 We’re now up to 20 sites across 11 states.\\xa0 By the end of next week, we’ll be to 45, and by the end of the May — end of May, we’ll be at 100.\\n\\nWe also — a few weeks ago, Vice President Pence and I were in a distribution center in Virginia — a food distribution center.\\xa0 He was kind enough to come and thank our associates for us there, which is much appreciated.\\n\\nAnd the President and Vice President were speaking on the phone about surgical gowns, and the President asked if we could put in an order for millions of surgical gowns.\\xa0 And we don’t normally buy those, so I wasn’t sure if we were going to be able to do that.\\xa0 But I’d like to thank our apparel team, and McKesson in particular, for partnering with us.\\xa0 We’ve been able to, in the month of April, secure an additional two and a half million surgical gowns.\\xa0 And by the end of May, we’ll have an additional 6 million available to help.\\n\\nSo thank you for the opportunity to serve and for being here.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Doug.\\xa0 Great job.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nMS. DONIGAN:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President, and thanks to the team for getting this great operation up and running for the benefit of the country.\\xa0 I’m Heyward Donigan with Rite Aid.\\xa0 And we are currently operating 40 percent of the current test sites in 25 locations across eight states.\\n\\nAnd we had the — I had the opportunity, as I was driving up, to stop at our Richmond location and see the testing in action and thank the associates — whether it be security or pharmacy front end, everybody who’s helping with this great effort and all of the customers that appreciate this so much.\\xa0 It was really amazing to see.\\n\\nAnd I want to thank my 50,000 associates also for keeping these retail locations up and running during these really, really tough times.\\xa0 It’s been quite amazing.\\xa0 And we too are going to expand our testing, and we’re doing about 1,500 a day.\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\n\\nSo thank you all very much.\\xa0 It’s incredible what we’ve done together over a short period of time.\\xa0 I want to thank our Vice President for the task force and the work.\\xa0 Every day, it gets better.\\n\\nAnd we had a fantastic goal with the governors today, and I would say that they are as — as thrilled as they can be, considering that the fact is that there has been so much unnecessary death in this country.\\xa0 It could have been stopped and it could have been stopped short, but somebody a long time ago, it seems, decided not to do it that way.\\xa0 And the whole world is suffering because of it — 184 countries at least.\\n\\nBut I want to thank all of these great businessmen and women for the job they’ve done.\\xa0 They have been fantastic with us, working with us.\\xa0 And, as you know, for several weeks, my administration has encouraged the governors to leverage unused testing capacity in states.\\xa0 Very few understood that we have tremendous capacity.\\n\\nThen, one week ago, we provided each governor with a list of names, addresses, and phone numbers of the labs where they could find additional testing capacity in their states.\\xa0 Within 48 hours, the number of tests performed across the country began to absolutely skyrocket.\\n\\nOn Saturday alone, more than 200,000 test results were reported, which is a gigantic number — bigger than any country anywhere in the world for a much longer period of time; a number that is an increase earlier in the month when we tested roughly less than 100,000 a day.\\xa0 So we much more than doubled it, and that will be doubling again very shortly.\\n\\nWe are continuing to rapidly expand our capacity and confident that we have enough testing to begin reopening.\\xa0 And the reopening process — we want to get our country open.\\xa0 And the testing is not going to be a problem at all.\\xa0 In fact, it’s going to be one of the great assets that we have.\\n\\nToday we’re releasing additional guidance on testing to inform the states as they develop their plans for a phased and very safe reopening.\\xa0 Our blueprint describes how states should unlock their full capacity, expand the number of testing platforms, establish monitoring systems to detect local outbreaks, and conduct contact tracing.\\xa0 We have it all.\\n\\nOther countries are calling to find out what are we doing and how do you do it.\\xa0 And we’re helping them.\\xa0 We’re dealing with a lot of countries, helping them on testing, just like we did on the ventilators.\\n\\nI directed our Medicare program to make it easier for seniors to get the testing that they need.\\xa0 And the pharmacies — as you know, we are allowing pharmacies now to do testing.\\xa0 And we have other testing locations that we’re going to be allowing also, but having pharmacies get involved in testing is a very big deal.\\xa0 We’re also asking governors to do the same in their Medicaid program.\\xa0 So they’re going to be able and authorized to do the same in Medicaid.\\xa0 So it’s a big — that’s a big deal.\\n\\nSo we’re deploying the full power and strength of the federal government to help states, cities — to help local government get this horrible plague over with and over with fast.\\xa0 There’s tremendous energy in our country right now.\\xa0 There’s energy like people haven’t seen in a long time — a spirit that they have not seen.\\xa0 And we’re doing very well — very well — considering what happened to us and considering if you look at what happened to others.\\n\\nThis is something that the world has not seen for a long, long time.\\xa0 You can probably go back to 1917, where it was a terrible period of time.\\xa0 You all know what happened in 1917.\\xa0 That’s over 100 years ago.\\n\\nWith that, I’d like to introduce, if I might — Dr. Birx, if you could come up.\\xa0 And then, Admiral, you’ll come up.\\xa0 And between the two of you, you’ll explain the entire process and how much progress we’ve made and where we’re going.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 So the blueprint lays out the roles and responsibilities to enhance our partnership between the private sector and the public sector, bringing together state and local governments with the federal government to ensure that we can accomplish and achieve our core principles and objectives.\\n\\nIf we can have the first slide.\\xa0 The core elements of the testing plan include both three elements: robust diagnostic testing plans developed in partnerships with state — and I just really want to thank the governors and the health officials, both at the state and local levels who have been working with us day and night to work through these issues, and also all the laboratory directors in many of those states, as well as the American Society for Microbiology, who have been working with us to ensure that the plans were efficient and effective.\\n\\nWithin the robust diagnostic testing plans, it was really unlocking the full capacity of the state: increasing the number of testing planforms — we now have multiple tests for different platforms; increasing the ability to collect samples; increasing testing and laboratory supplies; and ensuring that we work together to make sure that every client receives the test that they need.\\n\\nThis is added with timely monitoring systems.\\xa0 And what do I mean by that?\\xa0 Systems where we bring together the ability to not only diagnose the symptomatic, but proactively and interactively work with individuals that we know are at higher risk.\\xa0 We’ve worked with states to look at where the outbreaks have occurred when they’re not in the large metros, and we see that it occurs very often in places of close settings, among our Native Americans and among our long-term care facilities.\\xa0 So an active monitoring program that’s active, integrated, and innovative.\\n\\nAnd then combining this with the third element, which is the rapid response program, relying on CDC to be working with state and local governments to ensure that every symptomatic case — and, critically, the asymptomatic cases — are quickly tracked and traced to ensure that we can not only control this epidemic, but predict outbreaks before they expand.\\n\\nAnd then, finally, the plan includes an approach of using science and technology to develop even newer platforms, more efficient testing, really ensuring that the antibody tests that are utilized and recommended by both FDA and CDC have high quality and predicting both exposure to the virus and antibody development.\\n\\nAnd then, finally, working on innovative tests that could be high throughput and point-of-care — an antigen-based test or a point-of-care expanded nucleic acid test.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Very good.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Good job.\\n\\nAdmiral, please.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 And thank you, Ambassador Birx.\\xa0 If I could have the next slide, please.\\n\\nI want to spend just a couple minutes about telling — going over where we’ve been, but more importantly where we’re going.\\xa0 I think we all can understand how we can group this into three distinct phases.\\n\\nFirst is our launch phase, when we were really engaging the emerging epidemic and the types of things we need to do.\\xa0 For example, mobilize the private sector to develop tests and have EUAs.\\xa0 And I think you know, over the past two months, the FDA has issued 67 emergency use authorizations, which is far outpacing anything that has been done or could ever have been imagined.\\xa0 Galvanizing the research community and the commercial labs — the reason why we’re here with ACLA labs, having done about 3 million tests, is because of that day when it was galvanized by the President and the Vice President.\\n\\nWe also set models in the community.\\xa0 Those first community-based testing sites that were federally supported and, really, under the direction of the U.S. Public Health Service — people who had been in Japan, testing people on the Diamond Princess, to assure that it would be done right and it would be done safely for everyone involved.\\n\\nThen we moved to, really, scaling.\\xa0 That phase was very, very important because we knew we needed to be at an immense scale to enter the third phase about supporting opening again.\\xa0 This again — for example, a lot of my life is about swabs.\\xa0 It was enhancing the production capability of a small company in Maine, called Puritan, that you’ll hear a whole lot more about that has — that is, sort of, the swab provider for the country — but also, because of the FDA actions and the actions of scientific community, being able to broaden the types to spun polyester, so U.S. Cotton can now come in and start delivering, within the next couple of weeks, 3 million swabs per week of a different type.\\n\\nIt also did things like expanding the community-based testing sites.\\xa0 Whereas we started small with the commercial partners, you see today, right now, we have 73 of these 2.0 sites going to 110.\\xa0 And very importantly, this demonstrated the model.\\xa0 And 68 percent of those sites are in communities of moderate or high social vulnerability.\\xa0 And 22 percent are in the highest social vulnerability communities so that we can make sure that testing gets where it needs to be.\\xa0 You’ve just heard that that could be expanded to thousands of sites.\\n\\nAnd finally, stage three, which is very exciting: coordinating with governors to support testing plans and rapid response programs.\\xa0 Over the past week, a multidisciplinary team from the White House, HHS, FDA, FEMA has met virtually with multidisciplinary teams from every state, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia to understand what their testing aspirations are and to make sure that we can meet those demands.\\xa0 We’re going to have another round of those calls this week.\\n\\nBut as we talked about earlier today, we will be able to supply every state with the — with the supplies and the tests that they need.\\xa0 That will dramatically increase the number of tests we’ve done to this point.\\xa0 And just to give you an idea, the supplies that we will be providing to states — the minimum that we’re supplying to states is approximately double, in that month, than the Republic of Korea has performed in the four months to now accumulated — to give you an idea of the amount of testing that we’re going to be — going to be doing.\\n\\nSo I’m very exciting right now, as we complete this ecosystem with the large reference labs — the LabCorp and Quest providing the very high-throughput, large-scale testing; the galvanizing of the hospitals and academic labs that Dr. Birx has done, by a machine to machine, understanding and promoting that with the governors; and, of course, using point-of-care testing when and where that’s very important to stop outbreaks or in remote areas, like in the Indian Health Service or in Alaska.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Great job.\\xa0 Thanks, Brett.\\n\\nOkay.\\xa0 So with that, we’re here to answer some questions, and Mike is up here also.\\xa0 So, we’ll answer.\\n\\nSteve, please go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, as the governors grapple with when and how to open their states, what’s the best advice from you on what they should do — how quickly, how slowly?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we want them to do it.\\xa0 We recommend that they do it as quickly as possible, but safely.\\xa0 We want everyone to be safe.\\xa0 And I think you’re seeing that.\\xa0 You’re seeing a lot of governors get out and they want to open it up.\\xa0 Many are thinking about their school system.\\xa0 Not a long way to go in the school system right now for this season, for this year, but I think you’ll see a lot of schools open up even if it’s for a very short period of time.\\xa0 I think it would be a good thing.\\n\\nBecause, as you see, in terms of what this vicious virus goes after, young people seem to do very well.\\xa0 Young people seem to do very well.\\n\\nSo I know that there are some governors that aren’t necessarily ready to open up their states, but they may be ready to open up their school systems.\\xa0 We’ll see.\\xa0 But that’s their choice.\\xa0 But the word is “safety.”\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 Rapid, but safety.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 I have a question for you regarding one of the members of your Coronavirus Task Force, and that’s Secretary of HHS Alex Azar.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On January the 28th, he was in the briefing room.\\xa0 And in the briefing room, he told reporters that, for the individual American, the virus should not be an impact on their day-to-day life.\\xa0 Three months later, more than 55,000 of our fellow Americans have now lost their lives.\\xa0 Mr. President, why is he still your top health advisor?\\xa0 Why is he still serving as the HHS Secretary?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think it’s a very unfair question because you have many great professionals, some of them you have great respect for, and you have many people in the other party — you mention Alex Azar, but you have many people in the other party that have said the same thing and with even more confidence.\\xa0 So a lot of people didn’t get that right.\\n\\nI was — I was very fortunate, whether it was through luck or whatever, that we closed the border.\\xa0 We put a ban on China — other than our citizens coming in.\\xa0 We had our citizens — you can’t keep out American citizens.\\xa0 You know, “Gee, you can’t come back into your country.”\\xa0 That’s a little tough to do.\\n\\nBut we put a ban on China that was very fortunate.\\xa0 But I could tell you that Nancy Pelosi was dancing in the streets in Chinatown.\\xa0 She wanted to go, “Let’s go out and party.”\\xa0 That was late into February.\\xa0 So you don’t mention that, but you could mention that.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 Any other?\\xa0 Please, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s April, Mr. President.\\xa0 He has not been in a briefing, Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, please.\\xa0 Stand up.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — since April the 3rd.\\xa0 Does that show confidence in him?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You — you should have no complaints.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Yesterday, you retweeted someone who alleged that Democrats have quoted — quote, inflate — inflated “the mortality rate[s]” of the coronavirus “by underreporting the infection rate[s].”\\xa0 Do you believe that’s true — that there is some sort of conspiracy theory regarding the number of infections states are reporting?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0Well, I can only say what we’re doing. We’re reporting very accurately.\\xa0 If you look at other countries, other countries are not.\\xa0 I mean, you can look at China.\\xa0 You can look at numerous countries where I don’t think those are right numbers.\\n\\nI can only say what we’re doing.\\xa0 It’s very important to us to do very accurate reporting, and that’s what we’re doing.\\n\\nJon, go ahead.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible) by retweeting that, Mr. President?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about the Payment Protection Plan — the PPP plan — to help small businesses.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There have been a lot of concerns today with the website just not working.\\xa0 In fact, I heard from the American Bankers Association, saying that they are deeply frustrated, and until it’s fixed, American banks will not be able to help struggling small businesses.\\xa0 Do you know — can you give us an update?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I just came out and I hadn’t heard.\\xa0 I heard there was a glitch.\\xa0 We’ll find out whether or not that’s so.\\xa0 Certainly it did work out very well for the original amount of money.\\xa0 This is the second amount.\\xa0 And I’ll find out about that.\\xa0 We’ll find — we’re relying on the banks to go out and do an accurate job.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\xa0 In the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And will you list all the companies that get aid, Mr. President?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I wouldn’t mind doing that.\\xa0 I don’t know what the legal status of something like that — I would like to do that, as far as I’m concerned.\\xa0 I’m not involved in that process, but I would certainly like to have it listed.\\xa0 I’d have to find out if there’s a legal problem.\\xa0 But if there isn’t, I would do it gladly.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, Charlie Spiering from Breitbart News.\\xa0 And a majority of polls show that Americans blame China for the spread of the coronavirus, and yet they’re taking advantage of the crisis to make the world more dependent on their supply chains.\\xa0 How do you get — how do you hold China accountable and how do you keep our country — how do you incentivize our businesses?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0 Well, Charlie, there are a lot of ways you can hold them accountable.\\xa0 We’re doing very serious investigations, as you probably know.\\xa0 And we are not happy with China.\\xa0 We are not happy with that whole situation because we believe it could have been stopped at the source, it could have been stopped quickly, and it wouldn’t have spread all over the world.\\xa0 And we think that should have happened.\\xa0 So we’ll let you know at the appropriate time, but we are doing serious investigations.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How do you keep American businesses from relying on China for their supply chains?\\xa0 How do you — how do you fix that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’ve already discussed that, and especially having to do with medical supplies and others — and others.\\xa0 If you look prior to this virus, the deficit was coming way down under my administration because I put massive tariffs on China.\\xa0 We took in tens of billions of dollars.\\xa0 Gave some of it to the farmers who were unfairly targeted by China.\\xa0 Nobody has ever done that before.\\xa0 We never took in 10 cents from China.\\n\\nNow, all of a sudden, I think you know very well, we’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars.\\xa0 I helped the farmers by giving them, two years ago, $12 billion — all coming from China — and we had plenty leftover too.\\xa0 And then the following year, $16 billion.\\xa0 And this year, we’re also going to help our farmers.\\xa0 But nobody has ever done a thing like that.\\xa0 Because they were targeted unfairly by China.\\n\\nSo we’re doing a very strong investigation, and we’ll let you know what the result of that is.\\xa0 We should be able to get the answers too.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, as you talk about potentially reopening up America again, as we see in the slides behind you, what data are you going to look at in the future to see if restrictions need to be re-imposed?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, we’re looking very much and reliant very much on the local areas, the governors.\\xa0 And that’s been the way it has been for me, maybe not for everybody.\\xa0 But for me, that’s the way it’s been at the beginning and from the beginning.\\n\\nThe governors — some of them — are doing an extraordinary job.\\xa0 Not all of them, but some of them.\\xa0 And I think all of them maybe hasn’t have a chance to do that.\\xa0 Some will be a little bit different.\\xa0 The areas are much different.\\xa0 Manhattan is much different than Montana.\\xa0 You have a lot of different circumstances, but — and obviously, if you look at the virus, it hits some areas.\\xa0 Hasn’t hit very much other areas, not even at all.\\xa0 Almost not at all.\\n\\nBut the entire country has been infected.\\xa0 West Virginia — as an example, I spoke to Jim Justice, the governor of West Virginia, and they were along before anything hit and they had numerous deaths, even in West Virginia.\\xa0 And they were really the last one to be hit.\\n\\nSo we’re dealing with the governors.\\xa0 We had a really great call today, as I told you.\\xa0 Very, very solid.\\xa0 These are — these were not complaining people.\\xa0 These were people that were — they had everything they needed.\\xa0 They had their ventilators. They have their testing.\\xa0 They see their testing is growing. They’re growing their testing.\\xa0 We’re helping them.\\xa0 We’re getting them what they need.\\xa0 And that was a group — I wish — I mean, I’m sure some of you were on the line, even though supposed to be.\\xa0 And I think you know what the result you weren’t of that call was.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Could you talk about the supply chains, sir?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Following up on Charlie’s question on making China — holding them responsible — Germany sent a bill to China for 130 billion dollars in — excuse me, 130 billion euros for the damages caused by the coronavirus.\\xa0 Would your administration look at doing the same?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we can do something much easier than that.\\xa0 We have ways of doing things a lot easier than that.\\xa0 But Germany is looking at things and we’re looking at things.\\xa0 And we’re talking about a lot more money than Germany is talking about.\\n\\nYeah, please go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We haven’t determined the final amount yet.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s very substantial.\\xa0 If you take a look at the world — I mean, this is worldwide damage.\\xa0 This is damage to the U.S., but this is damage to the world.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Attorney General William Barr directed federal prosecutors to watch out for state and local officials that might be violating the Constitution by some of their stay-at-home orders.\\xa0 What’s the strategy there?\\xa0 Will the federal government sue local authorities or give the governors —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, you’d have to ask Attorney General Barr, but I think he wants to see — like everybody, he wants to see people get back and wants to see people get back to work.\\xa0 He doesn’t want people to be held up when there’s no reason for doing it.\\xa0 In some cases, perhaps it’s too strict.\\xa0 He wants to make sure people have their rights and they maintain their rights, very importantly.\\n\\nSo a lot of people would agree with him.\\xa0 But you’d actually have to ask that question specifically, from a legal standpoint, to Attorney General Barr.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you support the federal government suing state officials?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It would depend on the state.\\xa0 It would depend on the circumstances of the state.\\xa0 I mean, some states are, you know, perhaps a little early, and some states are a little bit late.\\xa0 And the Attorney General — I read that and I saw that — and, frankly, the Attorney General doesn’t want to have rights taken away.\\xa0 Because, you know, there are some people, they’re not allowed to open up a store or — you know, they’re going to lose their livelihood.\\n\\nAnd, by the way, that causes death also, between all of the things that happen.\\xa0 And this has been a big study.\\xa0 You know, the fact that people aren’t allowed to have their freedom causes a tremendous amount of problems, including death.\\xa0 So that’s what he’s talking about.\\n\\nPlease, in the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Maryland and other states — Governor Larry Hogan specifically said they’ve seen a spike in people using disinfectant after your comments last week.\\xa0 I know you said they were sarcastic, but do you take any —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I can’t imagine why.\\xa0 I can’t imagine why.\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you yeah take any responsibility if someone were to die?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I don’t.\\xa0 No, I can’t imagine — I can’t imagine that.\\n\\nYeah, go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, Dr. Anthony Fauci says that we need to increase testing by — double it at least, and so does the Rockefeller Foundation.\\xa0 When are we going to be doubling testing?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, that — it doesn’t really matter what they say there — and we just left him; we just had a meeting –but — because we’re going to have much more than double it very soon.\\n\\nNow, there are big believers in testing, and then there are some governors that don’t feel as strongly about it at all.\\xa0 You understand that.\\xa0 They feel much differently about it.\\n\\nBut we’re going with maximum testing, because it’s something we’re very capable of doing.\\xa0 But we’ll be much more than doubled.\\n\\nYou know, Mike, I’d like you to answer that.\\xa0 We’re going to be much higher than doubled on testing very shortly.\\n\\nMike, please.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 I hope the American people looking on today are as proud as the President and I are of the incredible public and private partnership that you heard from today.\\xa0 It was two months ago that we had done less than 10,000 tests for the coronavirus in the United States.\\xa0 But because the President brought together these incredible commercial labs, brought together the best-known retailers in America, now, Mr. President, we have 5.4 million tests.\\xa0 And as you said earlier today, we’ve — we’ve done more than 200,000 tests in a single day.\\n\\nAnd as we met with governors today, I sense the enthusiasm among governors for the way that testing is scaling all across the country.\\xa0 And we assured them on the call today that we’re going to continue to directly partner with them to make sure that all of the resources you heard about today continue to be expanded.\\n\\nBut I want to ask, Admiral Giroir, who is literally working day in and day out with the governors, to describe some of the numbers for exactly where we will be.\\xa0 We’re north of 5 million tests done now.\\xa0 It is — it is remarkable to think of the pace of acceleration.\\n\\nBut, Admiral, maybe you could speak about exactly when we will reach the point that some of the experts say that they think we need to be at, whether that be 300,000 tests a day or 500,000 tests a day.\\n\\nBut what’s remarkable to me as a layperson, Mr. President, is because of this partnership you’ve forged, we’re — we’re almost there.\\xa0 And we’ll be there very, very soon for the American people.\\n\\nBut everyone who is as anxious to see America reopen, as this President and our entire administration are, should know that the three-phased approach that the President outlined 10 days ago, we believe — and I believe, increasingly, governors understand around America — that we have a sufficient amount of testing today for every state that qualifies to enter phase one to begin to reopen their economies.\\n\\nAnd, Mr. President, with your permission, I’ll just ask Admiral Giroir to give some specific numbers about — about how quick — for all that we’ve done, how much more quickly you’ll see an expansion of testing because of the partnership that you witnessed again here today.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 The number of tests that need to be done depends on the state level. \\xa0You understand that places where there’s high virus circulating will need many, many more tests.\\xa0 Places that do not have high virus circulating may need less tests.\\n\\nBut let’s just assume Dr. Fauci was talking about a 4 million-per-month number, which was, sort of a week ago, where we — where we are.\\xa0 So, we will — according to the governors’ plans for next month, we will easily double that 4 million number.\\xa0 We will have over 20 million swabs that we’re going to send out.\\xa0 We will have over 15 million tubes of media.\\xa0 We have all the tests matched, machine to machine, in a focused area.\\xa0 We’ve gone state by state, and understand that.\\n\\nAnd this is not even including what you just heard: the 5 million-per-month test by LabCorp and Quest, or the point-of-care tests by Abbott, or all the other tests that are out there.\\n\\nSo, in May, we are going to be doing more testing in this country.\\xa0 And people talk about South Korea a lot.\\xa0 The state — the states with the least amount of testing will double the overall cumulative number, per capita, that South Korea has done in four months — to give you that understanding.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, Jon.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 I’m just wondering — this sounds incredibly promising — Walgreens, CVS with the drive-through tests, the diagnostic (inaudible).\\xa0 But we sat here in the Rose Garden, back on March 13, and these companies were here, some other companies were here.\\xa0 By my count, only 69 drive-through test sites have been set up by the companies that were here.\\n\\nI’m wondering if you — and, of course, Mr. Vice President, back in early March, you said we’d be at 4 million tests by the following week.\\xa0 We’re just now got there in the last few days.\\n\\nSo what have you learned about what went wrong, you know, a month and a half — or over the last month and a half or two months?\\xa0 And what’s going to go right, now?\\xa0 What lessons have you learned from the mistakes over the last, you know, month and a half or so?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Jon, I appreciate the question, but it represents a misunderstanding on your part and the — and frankly, the — a lot of people in the public’s part about the difference between having a test versus the ability to actually process the test.\\n\\nI mean, the truth was, when the President tapped me to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force two months ago, we saw the production of lots of test kits going into the marketplace.\\n\\nBut as the President has said many times, what he understood early on was the old system would never be able to process the tests at the massive volume that we would need in the midst of an epidemic.\\xa0 And that’s why the President brought together these extraordinary commercial labs that you’ve heard from today.\\xa0 Literally, sat them down in the Roosevelt Room and said, “We need you to turn all of your energies loose on doing the kind of high-speed testing that would be necessary for us to reach the numbers we’re at today.”\\n\\nAnd so there was no disconnect at all.\\xa0 There were — there were lots of test kits out there, Admiral, and frankly, there still are today.\\xa0 There are literally millions of tests that could be run in the old-style, slow laboratory that are still conducting tests today, whether it be at the CDC or at state laboratories.\\n\\nBut what the President brought about with this public-private partnership, has brought us to the point where we’ve done 5.4 million tests to date.\\xa0 And literally, you just heard that, by next month, it could — we could be doing as many as 2 million tests a week all across the country to give the American people confidence that we can reopen and get our economy moving again.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So when you said 4 million tests, seven weeks ago, you were just talking about tests being sent out, not actually being — being completed?\\xa0 I’m a little confused.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Jon, I think — precisely correct.\\xa0 That in my first week on this job, we were informed that HHS — I believe IDT was the vendor, Admiral Giroir — that had distributed a million, was distributing another 4 million.\\xa0 And we believe they did.\\n\\nBut again, those were tests that, frankly, but for the President’s leadership, we’d still be waiting on those tests to be done in many cases, because they were tests that were designed to be run in the old laboratory model.\\xa0 But early on, at the President’s direction, we brought in these incredible commercial labs.\\xa0 We partnered with these extraordinary retailers.\\xa0 And now we stand here today, literally — one day last week: more than 200,000 tests in a single day.\\xa0 About the time that we were making those comments, we — we’d done less than 25,000 tests in the entire country.\\n\\nBut we’ve met this moment with American ingenuity, with the incredible companies that are represented here.\\xa0 And we couldn’t be more proud.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think it’s very important to know — and this you can get from any other country, I think, if they’re being honest — not only do we have the most testing in the world by far, but we have, by far, the best testing.\\n\\nOAN, please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, thank you.\\xa0 I’d like to switch gears and talk about General Flynn.\\xa0 There are reports circulating now that he may well be fully exonerated this week.\\xa0 If that were — if that were the case, is there any reason why you would not bring him back into the administration?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I will only say this: I think that General Flynn is a wonderful man.\\xa0 He had a wonderful career.\\xa0 And it was a disgrace what happened to General Flynn.\\xa0 Let’s see what happens now.\\xa0 But what happened to General Flynn should never happen again in our country.\\xa0 What happened to other people should never happen again in our country.\\xa0 What happened to your President of the United States should never again be allowed to happen.\\n\\nGo ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, thank you.\\xa0 Today, one of your top economic advisors, Kevin Hassett — he said that the U.S. is likely to experience a 20 to 30 percent decline in the GDP in the second quarter, the worst since the Great Depression.\\xa0 Do you agree with that assessment?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 But I can tell you the third and the fourth quarter, in particular, are going to be, I think, spectacular.\\xa0 We were talking about it with the executives.\\xa0 I think we’re going to have a phenomenal third quarter.\\xa0 Nobody, you know, except one country, can be held accountable for what happened.\\xa0 Nobody is blaming anybody here.\\xa0 We’re looking at a group of people that should have stopped it at the source.\\n\\nBut — so what happens in second, happens in second.\\xa0 What we are doing is — I think we’re going to have — you’re going to see a big rise in the third, but you’re going to see an — an incredible fourth quarter, and you’re going to have an incredible next year.\\n\\nI think you’re going to have a recovery.\\xa0 Look, I built — they were just telling me inside, and it’s fact — I built the greatest economy — with the help of 325 million people, I built the greatest economy in the history of the world.\\xa0 And one day, because of something that should have never been allowed to happen, we had to close our country, we had to close our economy.\\n\\nI built it.\\xa0 We had the best employment numbers and the best unemployment numbers for Hispanic American, for African American, for Asian American, for everybody — best stock market numbers.\\xa0 And, by the way, the stock market was up very substantially today and people are seeing a lot of good things.\\xa0 A lot of very smart people investing in the stock market right now.\\xa0 It’s at 24,000 — approximately 24,000.\\n\\nAnd if you would’ve said, with a tragedy that this country had to endure and go through, with all of the death and the people that died and were so badly hurt by what happened, and you can only say God bless them — but if you would’ve said that our country would be in the position we’re in now — we’re ready to move forward.\\n\\nWe’ll never forget loved ones.\\xa0 We’ll never forget these great people that sacrifice for a reason of incompetence or something else other than incompetence.\\xa0 What happened at a point where they could have protected the whole world — not just us, the whole world.\\n\\nBut we had the greatest economy ever in the history of our world, and I had to turn it off in order to get to a point where we are today.\\xa0 And now we’re making a comeback.\\xa0 And I think we’re going to have, economically — from an economic standpoint, next year — an unbelievable year.\\xa0 And I think that you’re going to see a fantastic fourth quarter, and the third quarter will start to build.\\xa0 But the second quarter, obviously, you’re going to have GDP lack of growth.\\n\\nI’m looking at the head of Walmart.\\xa0 What a job Walmart has done in going through something.\\xa0 I mean, they were — they were doing yeoman’s work, including getting us millions of — of, really, very, very protective outfits.\\xa0 And — and — I mean, the job that Doug and Walmart did was incredible.\\xa0 Millions of outfits.\\xa0 And those are high quality.\\xa0 I’ve seen them.\\xa0 Those a high quality.\\xa0 That’s what we need.\\n\\nSo people have stepped up to the plate.\\xa0 I think we’re going to have a really good — I think it’s good to start building.\\xa0 I think it’s going to build fast.\\xa0 I think it’ll be a tremendous, tremendous comeback.\\n\\nAnd, you know, so I say I built the greatest economy — with all of the people that helped me and all of the people in this country, we built the greatest economy the world has ever seen.\\xa0 And we’re going to do it again.\\xa0 And it’s not going to be that long.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nYes, please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, opening up the country, how long will you keep up the travel restrictions for Europe?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re looking at that, and it depends on how long it’s taken Europe to heal.\\xa0 Italy is starting to make a comeback.\\xa0 I’m very happy to see that, with my friend, the Prime Minister.\\xa0 He’s — it’s tragic what went on in Italy and Spain and France and Germany, frankly, and every — every country over there.\\xa0 It’s tragic.\\xa0 But we’ll be looking at what’s happening in Europe.\\xa0 And certainly, we want to do that and they want to do it too.\\xa0 They want to do it very badly.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you have any update on Kim Jong Un’s health?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Say it?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have you gotten any update on Kim Jong Un’s health?\\xa0 Has he responded to your letter from March?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 On Kim Jong Un?\\xa0 I can’t tell you exactly.\\xa0 Yes, I do have a very good idea, but I can’t talk about it now.\\xa0 I just wish him well.\\xa0 I’ve had a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un.\\n\\nIf I weren’t President, you’d be in war.\\xa0 You would’ve been in war with Korea.\\xa0 You would have been in war with North Korea if I wasn’t President — that, I can tell you.\\xa0 He expected that — that, I can tell you.\\n\\nI — I hope he’s fine.\\xa0 I do know how he’s doing, relatively speaking.\\xa0 We will see.\\xa0 You’ll probably be hearing in the not-too-distant future.\\n\\nAll right.\\xa0 One or two more.\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is he alive?\\xa0 Are — are you confirming he’s alive?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I want to ask you a question about the 2020 election.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Your likely Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, recently suggested that you were considering changing the date of the election, that you might try something like that.\\xa0 That’s my first question.\\n\\nThe second question is —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I never even thought of changing the date of the election.\\xa0 Why would I do that?\\xa0 November 3rd.\\xa0 It’s a good number.\\xa0 No, I look forward to that election.\\n\\nAnd that was just made-up propaganda — not by him, but by some of the many people that are working, writing little statements.\\xa0 I see all the time: “Statement made…”\\xa0 You say, “So, statement made per Joe Biden.”\\xa0 Sleepy Joe.\\xa0 He didn’t make those statements, but somebody did.\\xa0 But they said he made it.\\xa0 No, let him know I — I’m not thinking about it at all.\\xa0 Not at all.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 In the back, please.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee came out with the fourth installment of its report.\\xa0 It concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections and there was not political bias.\\xa0 Do you accept its conclusions?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, I don’t know.\\xa0 I haven’t seen the report.\\xa0 I haven’t seen the report.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, nice to see you.\\xa0 I think you have a good relationship with North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.\\xa0 But last Saturday, Senator Graham — he mentioned in the Fox News — he interviewed.\\xa0 He said —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He didn’t say anything last Saturday.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — that Kim Jong Un —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Nobody — nobody knows where he is, so he obviously couldn’t have said it.\\xa0 If you have a — this is breaking news.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That Kim Jong Un made a statement on Saturday, I don’t think so.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, but the —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, go ahead.\\xa0 Let’s do — let’s do one more.\\xa0 Please, in the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If an American President loses more Americans over the course of six weeks than died in the entirety of the Vietnam War, does he deserve to be reelected?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So, yeah, we’ve lost a lot of people.\\xa0 But if you look at what original projections were — 2.2 million — we’re probably heading to 60,000, 70,000.\\xa0 It’s far too many.\\xa0 One person is too many for this.\\n\\nAnd I think we’ve made a lot of really good decisions.\\xa0 The big decision was closing the border or doing the ban — people coming in from China — obviously, other than American citizens, which had to come in.\\xa0 Can’t say, “You can’t come in.\\xa0 You can’t come back to your country.”\\n\\nI think we’ve made a lot of good decisions.\\xa0 I think that Mike Pence and the task force have done a fantastic job.\\n\\nI think that everybody working on the ventilators — you see what we’ve done there — have done unbelievable.\\xa0 The press doesn’t talk about ventilators anymore.\\xa0 They just don’t want to talk about them and that’s okay.\\xa0 But the reason they don’t want to talk — that was a subject that nobody would get off of.\\xa0 They don’t want to talk about them.\\n\\nWe’re in the same position on testing.\\xa0 We are lapping the world on testing.\\xa0 And the world is coming to us.\\xa0 As I said, they’re coming to us, saying, “What are you doing?\\xa0 How do you do it?”\\xa0 And we’re helping them.\\n\\nSo, no, I think we’ve done a great job.\\xa0 And one person — I will say this: One person is too many.\\n\\nThank you all very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nEND\\n\\n6:33 P.M.

       "  'text': 'James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\\n\\nApril 24, 2020\\n5:39 P.M. EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much, everyone.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 We continue to see evidence that our aggressive strategy is working and working at a very high level.\\xa0 Nationwide, the percent of tests that come back positive has declined very significantly.\\n\\nLast week, roughly 38 percent of the tests in New York were positive.\\xa0 This week, that number is down to 28 percent.\\xa0 New cases in New York are down 50 percent compared to a week ago.\\xa0 And fatalities are down 40 percent over the same period.\\xa0 In Louisiana, the rate of positive test result had declined from 25 percent down to 15 percent in the last seven days alone.\\n\\nEighteen states now show a decline in a number of positive tests in the last seven days.\\xa0 So, over the last seven days, there’s been very, very significant progress.\\n\\nHalf of all Americans live in states that have now taken steps to open their economies.\\xa0 Just yesterday, Governors Gavin Newsom, California; Tim Walz of Minnesota; and Bill Lee of Tennessee announced additional plans to restart certain sectors.\\n\\nWe ask every American to maintain vigilance and hygiene, social distancing and voluntary use of face coverings.\\xa0 We’re opening our country.\\xa0 It’s very exciting to see.\\xa0 We have a lot of talent involved, from governors down to people that just stand there and help you with the doors.\\xa0 There’s been tremendous talent involved and tremendous spirit from our country.\\xa0 The country is a great place, and it’s going to be greater than ever before.\\xa0 I really believe that.\\xa0 I think there’s going to be a tremendous upward shift.\\n\\nI spoke with Tim Cook, today, of Apple.\\xa0 And they have a good sense of the market, and he feels it’s going to be a “V.”\\xa0 The “V” is sharply upward later on as we actually get it fully open.\\n\\nToday, I signed the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, providing $320 billion to keep American workers on the payroll.\\xa0 Thirty billion dollars of the Paycheck Protection funds will be reserved for small financial institutions, including those that serve minority and distressed communities, extending vital relief to thousands of African American and Hispanic American small-business owners and their employees.\\n\\nThe bill also delivers $75 billion for hospitals — so badly needed for hospitals; they’ve taken a very big hit — and medical providers.\\xa0 In areas less affected by the virus, hospitals and doctors should work with their state and local health officials on ways to safely resume elective medical treatments and care.\\n\\nUnder the CARES Act, we’re sending back payments to millions of American workers.\\xa0 More than 80 million Americans have already received their payment: $3,400 for a typical family of four.\\xa0 Three thousand four hundred dollars.\\xa0 That’s great.\\xa0 And you deserve it.\\n\\nThe CARES Act requires that the federal government send out a notice of what benefits Americans are receiving.\\xa0 To fulfill the requirement, the Treasury Department is mailing a letter to me.\\xa0 It will include the amount, their economic impact payment, how it will arrived — direct deposit, check, or prepaid debit card — as well as a message to the nation, letting each American know that we are getting through this challenge together as one American family.\\xa0 And that’s what’s been happening.\\n\\nThe whole world is watching us.\\xa0 You have 184 countries out there that have been hit, and now it’s probably higher than that.\\xa0 But they’re all watching us.\\xa0 They’re all watching and they’re calling, and they respect what we’re doing, so much.\\n\\nI spoke with the leaders of numerous countries today.\\xa0 They’re asking if we can send them ventilators, and I’m agreeing to do it.\\xa0 We have tremendous capacity — now, over-capacity of ventilators.\\xa0 We’re filling up stockpiles for our states and for ourselves.\\xa0 The federal government has over 10,000 ventilators, and we could have a lot more if we wanted to do that.\\xa0 But we’re helping Mexico, Honduras, Indonesia, France.\\xa0 We’re sending to France.\\xa0 We’re sending to Spain.\\xa0 We’re sending to Italy.\\xa0 And we’ll probably be sending to Germany, should they need them.\\n\\nOver the last three years, we built the strongest economy and the most successful country the world has ever seen.\\xa0 Greatest economy the world has ever seen.\\xa0 Nobody has ever done anything like what we were able to do.\\n\\nAnd we will rebuild that economy.\\xa0 Our economy in the not-too-distant future, I really believe, with all that we’ve learned and all that we’ve done, will be just as strong and maybe stronger than ever before — even stronger than it was just two months ago.\\n\\nSome interesting note is that the FDA approved the first at-home COVID-19 test kit.\\xa0 It just got approved. \\xa0And Dr. Stephen — where is Stephen?\\xa0 Stephen Hahn.\\xa0 Stephen?\\xa0 — is going to say a couple of words about that and some other things.\\n\\nI want to thank Stephen.\\xa0 The FDA has been incredible. They’ve been approving not only this, but they’ve been approving many things at a pace that’s never happened before.\\xa0 And they’re being very safe about it, as Stephen told me.\\xa0 He’s told me — told me very strongly.\\xa0 But at the same time, they’re approving things at record numbers, in a record — at a record rate.\\xa0 And it’s really been helpful.\\n\\nMany tests are going on — many vaccine tests and tests of every different kind.\\xa0 And things are happening.\\xa0 Just like this event, things are happening very rapidly.\\xa0 And I’d like to have Stephen tell you a little bit about it.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\xa0 Stephen, please.\\n\\nDR. HAHN:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 I appreciate the opportunity to tell you about what’s happening at the FDA.\\xa0 We have a team of more than 18,000 employees, including 10,000 scientists, doctors, pharmacists, and nurses, and they’ve been working around the clock because, as you probably know, many of the medical products that are being used for the COVID-19 outbreak are, in fact, regulated by FDA.\\xa0 The staff have been hard at work authorizing tests and other medical products.\\n\\nAs part of these efforts to support diagnostic test development during this global pandemic, the President has asked us, and under his leadership, to actually cut down as many barriers as we possibly could to get medical products into the medical community, and we have done that, of course recognizing the urgency of the situation.\\n\\nI do want to emphasize what the President said, that — is that we are very much paying attention to safety and with respect to test validity and reliability of those tests.\\n\\nAnd I think it’s really important to understand how far we’ve come in just a few short months.\\xa0 The academic community, which I come from; the private sector; the government — we’ve come together to develop diagnostics for a completely new infectious disease.\\n\\nAnd it’s really important — we’ve heard from many test developers, both in academia and in the manufacturing world: This normally takes years to develop.\\xa0 You’ve heard Dr. Birx talk about the fact that HIV tests has taken many, many years to develop.\\xa0 This has happened in weeks and months.\\xa0 We’ve been laser focused on working with both industry and academia to actually make this happen.\\n\\nTo date, under our emergency use authorization approach, we’ve quickly reviewed and authorized 63 tests, both diagnostic, as well as serologic — that is the antibody test.\\xa0 We’ve had several point-of-care tests, and that’s important because those can be done in the emergency room or in a doctor’s office, et cetera, and much more convenient for the patient.\\n\\nAnd this week, as the President said, we authorized the first at-home test by a company called LabCorp.\\xa0 This is a test where, under certain circumstances, with a doctor’s supervision, a test can be mailed to a patient and the patient can perform the self-swab and then mail it back and get the results after that time — all under the guidance of a licensed physician.\\n\\nAnd we’re not just letting up with these 63 tests we’ve approved.\\xa0 We are working with more than 400 test developers who are pursuing authorization for their diagnostics under our current policies.\\xa0 And under our regulatory approach, which is quite flexible, many other tests are becoming available.\\n\\nWe are — we have heard, and have reported to us, 220 labs around the country have begun patient testing using their own validated tests.\\xa0 This has allowed us to increase, significantly, tests around the country.\\n\\nI updated you earlier this week on serologic tests — these antibody tests that are used to detect natural immunity — and the FDA’s approach to help make these tests available.\\xa0 While these are just one part of our larger response effort, they can play a role in helping move our economy forward by helping healthcare professionals identify those who have immunity to the COVID-19.\\n\\nAnd just finally, when it comes to therapeutics, we are leaving no stone unturned in finding treatments for COVID-19.\\xa0 You do know that we don’t have any approved currently therapeutics for COVID-19, but we are actively involved with both the academic and the commercial and private sector to find those.\\xa0 Seventy-two trials of therapeutics are underway in the United States under FDA oversight and 211 are in the planning stages, so we expect to see more.\\xa0 This includes convalescent plasma, as well as antiviral therapies.\\n\\nWork continues on vaccines.\\xa0 And two firms have announced that the FDA has authorized their trials to go forward, one of which we’ve mentioned here before.\\n\\nAnd finally, in response to the President’s and Task Force’s request, we’ve stood up the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program.\\xa0 We are leaving no stone unturned, as I said, and we’re working around the clock to develop these therapeutics for the American people.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Hahn, a question about antibody tests, please?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, Doc.\\xa0 Would you like to maybe —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s a quick question —\\n\\nDR. HAHN:\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and it’s timely, because just about an hour ago, a Subcommittee with Oversight released some findings that the FDA doesn’t have any review of the antibody tests that are on the market.\\xa0 There are no guidelines to tell which ones should be out there, and there’s no way to test their accuracy.\\xa0 They’re quite worried that these are junk tests on the market because they weren’t reviewed before they were approved.\\xa0 Is that true?\\n\\nDR. HAHN:\\xa0 So, under our policy, we provide a flexibility.\\xa0 What we’ve told manufacturers is that, in order to market in the U.S., they have to validate their tests, they have to tell us that they validated their tests, and then, in the package insert, they have to let people know — end users, labs, et cetera — that those tests were not authorized by FDA.\\n\\nWe’ve authorized four.\\xa0 As I mentioned, more are in the pipeline.\\xa0 And these tests that have come in without any information to us, but have been self-validated — as I mentioned at the podium a couple days ago, we are working with the National Cancer Institute, as well as CDC, to perform our own validation of the tests that that have been sent to us.\\n\\nSo we’ll provide as much information as we possibly can.\\xa0 And there is transparency on our website about those tests, and also the tests that we have authorized.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\n\\nMike, please.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 From early in this effort, President Trump has called forth a whole-of-government response to the coronavirus epidemic in America.\\xa0 And by that, the President made clear, when he asked me to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force, not merely a whole-of-the-federal government but a full partnership with state and local governments across the country.\\xa0 And today we renewed that with our latest conference call with governors all across America.\\n\\nWe met with them today, specifically to speak about the progress that our governors are making expanding testing across the country.\\xa0 And we were pleased to hear about the extraordinary and rapid progress that governors are making.\\n\\nAt the — at the outset of the call, where we had more than 50 of our nation’s governors, we, of course, had Pete Gaynor of FEMA report on progress: more than 35,000 National Guard stood up, 5,000 active-duty military deployed in 10 states.\\xa0 And we were also pleased to report that FEMA, HHS, and the private sector have coordinated the delivery of shipments to states around the country, including nearly 67 million N95 masks, 105 million surgical masks, surgical gowns, shields, gloves, more than 10,000 ventilators, and more than 8,000 federal field medical station beds.\\n\\nBeyond the report that we provided to the governors, we assured them that, at the President’s direction, this is one team, one mission.\\xa0 And we made it clear to the governors that we know we’re all in this together.\\xa0 And the partnership that we have forged together really begins with mitigation efforts.\\xa0 It moves to making sure our healthcare workers have the support they need, but also testing is in the forefront of all of our minds.\\n\\nWe’re working — working to make it possible for every governor to access the existing capacity to enable our states to be able to reopen responsibly under the phased approach that the President unveiled one week ago.\\n\\nA little bit of context: You may recall that, one month ago, all of the testing that had been done in America — 80,000 Americans had been tested.\\xa0 But as of this morning, 5.1 million Americans have been tested for the coronavirus.\\n\\nA quick reminder to our fellow Americans, and this was something from our scientists today at the task force, and we reminded governors of this as well: that as testing increases dramatically across the country, cases will increase as well.\\xa0 But people should not be discouraged by those numbers.\\xa0 We are looking at very positive trends in hospitalization, in emergency room entrances.\\xa0 And we continue to see, as we’ve said at this podium every day over the last several weeks — we continue to see positive progress not just on the West Coast, but even where the coronavirus epidemic has most deeply impacted in areas of the Greater New York City area, New Orleans, Detroit, and elsewhere.\\n\\nOn our nearly two-hour phone call today with those governors, we heard of the progress governors were making in implementing the resources that we’ve been working to provide them: not just the medical equipment, but also, as you recall, that map, a week ago, that showed where all of the equipment is all across the country in all 50 states.\\n\\nGovernor Cuomo joined us for the call today.\\xa0 He spoke favorably of his meeting here at the White House, Mr. President, and his recognition that testing is a partnership between the federal and state governments.\\xa0 As Governor Cuomo said today, he understood that the federal government works with national manufacturing and supply chain, and the governors deal with the labs to expand and implement testing at the state level.\\n\\nGovernor Cuomo also explained how he’s using his licensing authority as a governor to stand up the more than 300 labs that can do coronavirus testing in the state of New York.\\xa0 And we congratulated him for his leadership in that and urged other governors to use their authority similarly.\\n\\nIn Tennessee, Governor Bill Lee told us that he’s deployed the National Guard to stand up more than 20 drive-through test sites.\\xa0 They’re testing 10,000 people a day and have already tested more than 130,000 people in Tennessee, and they expect to surge another 15,000 people in testing sites this weekend in Tennessee.\\n\\nMassachusetts is an area we’re continuing to watch very closely as cases have not yet stabilized.\\xa0 And Governor Charlie Baker, after he thanked us, Mr. President, for the Army Corps of Engineers deployment of four field hospitals, he described how they have rapidly expanded testing all across Massachusetts.\\xa0 We commended him for that.\\xa0 In the beginning of March, he said they had just one testing site in the state of Massachusetts.\\xa0 And now, thanks to Governor Charlie Baker’s team, they have more than 30 testing sites.\\n\\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz reflected on the call today about the partnership he’s forged with the Mayo Clinic, the University of Minnesota, and state health department.\\xa0 They’re actually collaborating to perform 20,000 molecular tests and 15,000 antibody tests per day.\\xa0 And I’m looking forward to traveling to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota on Tuesday of next week to learn firsthand from the governor about their efforts across the state to expand testing.\\n\\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds gave us an update, Mr. President, on her progress.\\xa0 She’s literally tripling testing capacity in her state through a partnership with the private sector, with the University of Iowa and Iowa State University.\\xa0 She also launched the TestIowa.com website, which actually creates an access point for people to fill out a questionnaire about whether or not their symptoms or circumstances would justify a test.\\xa0 She said, in the first 72 hours, 150,000 people went to the test site to receive an assessment.\\xa0 And Iowa is now testing 4,500 people a day in their state.\\n\\nIn Indiana, I spoke also today with Governor Eric Holcomb.\\xa0 They’ve tested 72,000 Hoosiers to date.\\xa0 They’re adding drive-through sites.\\xa0 They’ll have 10 drive-through sites established by the state of Indiana before the end of the weekend.\\xa0 And as other governors have done, Governor Holcomb, last week, opened up half of their elective surgery sites and hospitals across the state.\\xa0 And they’ll be opening up the balance of their elective surgery sites next week.\\n\\nIn Maryland, another area that we’re watching very closely, Governor Larry Hogan expressed appreciation for federal support, as he’s continuing to scale testing.\\xa0 He had been in touch with the National Institute of Health, which is opening up its laboratories for Maryland to do testing.\\xa0 And we were also able to confirm to him that Walter Reed Hospital’s laboratory capacity is available to Maryland.\\n\\nAnd in Utah, Mr. President, Governor Gary Herbert told us that he actually diverted 1,200 state employees to do contact tracing in their state.\\xa0 In the last 36 hours, 23,000 residents have also signed up for what they’re calling their “Healthy Together” app.\\xa0 And they have 50 different testing locations across Utah and have tested 82,000 people in the state already.\\n\\nOther state examples, Mr. President, were — were just as inspiring.\\n\\nGovernor Phil Murphy of New Jersey has forged a partnership with Rutgers University.\\xa0 Working closely with the FDA, they’ve authorized a saliva-based test that is being deployed just at that site that’s expanding their ability to track what continues to be a very challenging environment in New Jersey.\\n\\nAnd Governor Mike Parson of Missouri, Mr. President, also told us how they’d worked with Google Marketplace to create an online portal for more than 200 companies in Missouri who have repurposed their manufacturing lines to create medical supplies to meet their need within the state.\\n\\nAnd in Connecticut, Governor Ned Lamont spoke about positive trend lines in Connecticut, which has been really at the center of the outbreak in the Greater New York area.\\xa0 But he also said they were hoping to double testing over the next week.\\n\\nMr. President, that’s just a sampling of what we heard today.\\xa0 And I know it’s an encouragement to you, and I trust it’s an encouragement to people all across the country that, at your direction, we are implementing a testing strategy that is supported at the federal level but it is deployed and managed at the state level.\\n\\nAnd we want to express our appreciation to every governor across the country that are — that are standing up all of those labs that are available, that are working with us and our supply chain personnel to make sure that the reagents and the swabs and the equipment is there to be able to process the tests.\\n\\nAnd we’re going to continue to increase testing dramatically in the weeks ahead.\\xa0 So we want to thank our governors for the progress that we’re making on testing and for their role in — in urging their citizens to practice the kind of mitigation and social distancing efforts that are really making real progress.\\n\\nWe’re one team, one mission, and that’s to save lives.\\xa0 And because of all the efforts that have been made at the state level, the strong guidance that’s come from the federal level, and because of the amazing healthcare workers across this country and our first responders, but mostly, I believe, because of the cooperation of millions of Americans who’ve put the guidance into practice, their cooperation and their prayers have set us on a path where we are slowing the spread; we are protecting our most vulnerable.\\n\\nAnd I truly do believe the day will soon come when we will heal our land, and we’ll be able to reopen America and put this great nation back to work.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\n\\nEND\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\n\\n6:01 P.M.

       "  'text': 'James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\\n\\n5:48 P.M. EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Later this evening, we expect the House to pass the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act.\\xa0 I’m grateful that Congress is answering my call to deliver these additional $320 billion in relief for the American worker and for small businesses.\\n\\nAt a time when many Americans are enduring significant economic challenges, this bill will help small businesses to keep millions of workers on the payroll.\\xa0 You see states are starting to open up now, and it’s very exciting to see.\\xa0 I think it’s very awe-inspiring.\\xa0 We’re coming out of it, and we’re coming out of it well.\\n\\nAnd we’re — really, I’m very happy the governors have been — the governors, really, have been doing a really good job working with us, and it’s — it’s, really, pretty impressive to see.\\xa0 I’ve spoken to numerous leaders of countries over the last 48 hours, and they are saying we’re leading the way.\\xa0 We’re really leading the way in so many different ways.\\n\\nI’m also very pleased that Harvard — as you know, it’s Harvard and Stanford and Princeton and numerous other universities and colleges, and also large businesses have sent funds back to us.\\xa0 And in some cases, I stopped funds that I looked at.\\xa0 And we are pleased to report that the funds have either not gone out or it’s about $350 million, and they’ve either not gone out or we’ve renegotiated it and they’re not getting them.\\n\\nSo — and it’s — in a couple of cases, they’re sending them back and sending them back immediately.\\xa0 So I think it was very nice.\\xa0 I want to thank Harvard in particular.\\xa0 They acted very quickly and decisively.\\xa0 And they agreed, when they heard the facts, that they should not be getting it.\\xa0 So we appreciate it very much from Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and other institutions.\\n\\nThe bill also includes $30 billion to support small lending institutions serving distressed communities, helping countless African American and Hispanic American small businesses.\\n\\nAs we continue our battle against the virus, the data and facts on the ground suggest that we’re making great progress.\\xa0 In 23 states, new cases have declined in the peak — week.\\xa0 Forty percent of American counties have also seen a rapid decline in new cases.\\xa0 Forty-six states reported drop in patients showing coronavirus-like symptoms.\\xa0 That’s a big number.\\n\\nTo keep America gaining momentum, every citizen needs to maintain the vigilance.\\xa0 And we all understand that very well; we’ve gone over it many, many times.\\xa0 This includes practicing good hygiene, maintaining social distance, and the voluntary use of face covering.\\n\\nA safe and phased reopening of our economy — it’s very exciting, but it does not mean that we are letting down our guard at all, in any way.\\xa0 On the contrary, continued diligence is an essential part of our strategy to get our country back to work, to take our country back.\\xa0 We’re winning this, and we’re going to win it, and we’re going to keep watching.\\xa0 We’re going to watch very closely for the invisible enemy.\\n\\nWith each passing day, we’re learning more and more about this enemy.\\xa0 The scientists at DHS have released a report offering a number of insights about how the virus reacts to different temperatures, climates, and surfaces.\\xa0 The findings confirm that the virus survives better in cold or in drier environments and does less well in warmer and more humid environments.\\n\\nI have to say that, very excitingly, we’re going to have somebody up; Bill will be up in just a little while.\\xa0 It was a great report you gave.\\xa0 And he’s going to be talking about how the virus reacts in sunlight.\\xa0 Wait until you hear the numbers.\\xa0 You won’t even believe them.\\n\\nU.S. trials of the COVID-19 have been going on and have been approved in the United States, Germany, UK, and China.\\xa0 That’s big news.\\xa0 And we’re — a lot of trials are going on.\\xa0 We have a lot of great, brilliant minds working on this, both from the standpoint of a vaccine and therapeutics.\\n\\nWe must be careful in all conditions, but we will — we will get this done.\\xa0 We’re very close to a vaccine.\\xa0 Unfortunately, we’re not very close to testing because when the testing starts, it takes a period of time.\\xa0 But we’ll get it done.\\n\\nAnd I want to thank the head of DHS Science and Technology, Bill Bryan, for what he’s going to be doing and what he’s going to be saying and the report that he’s about to give.\\xa0 I think it’s going to be something that nobody has ever heard.\\xa0 It’ll be brand-new information and very important information.\\n\\nMy administration continues to leverage the Defense Production Act to dramatically increase the manufacture and delivery of critical medical supplies. \\xa0We finalized three contracts to produce 39 million more N95 masks in 90 days.\\xa0 And as you know, we’re also using a sterilization process.\\xa0 Some great equipment that will sterilize the masks up to 20 times per mask.\\xa0 So that’s like ordering 20 times more masks.\\xa0 And it’s working very well.\\n\\nWe just want the hospitals and the institutions, where it is, to use it.\\xa0 A lot of people don’t use it.\\xa0 They’re so used to getting a new mask, they don’t want to use it.\\xa0 They want to go and immediately get a new one.\\xa0 We’re asking them to use the sterilization process.\\xa0 Every bit as good — up to 20 times.\\xa0 Think of that.\\n\\nIn addition to ramping up our domestic assembly lines, we also have airlifted nearly 750 million pieces of personal protective equipment into the United States through our Project Airbridge, which has been an incredible thing to watch.\\xa0 It’s really a military operation.\\n\\nThe Vice President is now providing each governor with an exhaustive count[y]-by-county breakdown of the privately distributed personal protection.\\xa0 And this is equipment and things that are incredible.\\xa0 It’s personal protective equipment.\\xa0 It’s incredible, and it’s all brand new and at the highest level.\\xa0 We’re getting only the highest level.\\xa0 And also, we’re looking at essential gear within their states, and it’s being delivered to different states quickly and as we speak.\\n\\nThis way, the governor should know exactly what’s being delivered through a private-sector supply chain within their states, as well as through the Project Airbridge.\\xa0 We’re trying to get it immediately from the plane to the state.\\xa0 When we can’t do that, we bring it into our facilities and get it to the governors.\\xa0 And we’re getting them fast, and we’re notifying them very strongly so they know it’s there.\\xa0 Governors can use this information to quickly ensure that they get materials where and when they are needed.\\n\\nToday, I also want to extend my special thanks to our nation’s incredible county emergency management teams who have been working relentlessly for weeks around the clock, end on end, to serve their communities, help distribute critical supplies, and save countless American lives.\\xa0 We salute these heroic officials on the frontlines.\\n\\nAs we continue to develop potential therapies, the FDA has recently begun a national effort to expand access to convalescent plasma donated from the blood of those who have recovered from the virus.\\xa0 The blood of these donors contains antibodies that can potentially reduce the severity of the illness in those who are sick — and frankly, those that are very sick.\\xa0 Nearly 3,000 patients are now enrolled in the Expanded Access Program, receiving transfusions nationwide.\\n\\nAnd I want to thank all of the people that recovered, for what they’ve done.\\xa0 They — as I said yesterday, they raise their hand when they barely can walk, and they’re saying, “I want to donate blood.\\xa0 I want to donate whatever it is that you want, because we want to help people.”\\xa0 It’s really quite incredible.\\n\\nConvalescent plasma will also be used to manufacture a concentrated antibody treatment that does not have to be matched with a particular blood type.\\xa0 This concentrated antibody treatment could be used as a preventative measure to keep healthcare workers and other high-risk populations from contracting the virus in the first place.\\xa0 A very big deal.\\n\\nClinical trials of these products are slated to begin within weeks, and we can maybe have a fairly quick solution.\\xa0 I urge Americans to get in there and keep doing what you’re doing, because again, we want those people recovering or recovered from coronavirus to contact their local blood and plasma donation center to learn how they can help.\\xa0 And they’ve been so great, and I just appreciate it.\\n\\nMy administration has also partnered with leading — and we have really been establishing some great partnerships with leading technology companies and scientific journals to create a database of 52,000 scholarly articles on the virus that can be analyzed by artificial intelligence.\\n\\nTop AI experts are now using this wealth of data to gain insights into potential therapies.\\xa0 And we’re collaborating with tech firms, universities, and our national labs to harness American supercomputers in the search for treatments and vaccines.\\xa0 That search is going on, and it’s being — I think you’ll see in the future — you’ll see it’s very successful.\\xa0 Ultimately, it’ll be a tremendous success.\\xa0 Great progress is being made at a rapid pace — a pace like no other.\\n\\nWe have every hope that with the full might and resources of American science and technology, and with the courage and devotion of the American people who have been so incredible, we will end this plague, and together we will restore the full measure of American strength and power and prosperity.\\n\\nOur country is going to do fantastically well.\\xa0 You see what’s going on.\\xa0 There is a pent-up demand in our country to get it back right where it was and maybe even better, and that’s what’s going to happen.\\n\\nSo with that, I’d like to ask Mike Pence to come up — Vice President.\\xa0 Say a few words please, Mike.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 And good afternoon.\\xa0 Today, the White House Coronavirus Task Force met.\\xa0 And while our hearts are with the families of those who have lost their life to the coronavirus and those who are struggling with serious illness today, our team, led by Dr. Deborah Birx, informs us that the data continues to show promising signs of progress.\\n\\nThe New York metro area, New Jersey, Connecticut, Detroit and New Orleans all appear to be past their peak.\\xa0 And we are seeing consistent declines in hospitalization and cases in regions across the country.\\n\\nOur only conclusion is that we’re getting there, America, because the American people have put into practice the President’s guidelines of social distancing because you’ve been listening and adhering to the guidance of state and local officials.\\xa0 We are — we’re making — we’re making meaningful progress.\\xa0 In a very real sense, sparing Americans to be exposed to the coronavirus and, no less extent, saving lives.\\n\\nOur task force actually believes, Mr. President, that if we continue these mitigation efforts in the days ahead — as states implement their policies, including phased reopening — that we’ll preserve those gains.\\xa0 We do believe, by early summer, we could be in a much better place as a nation with much of this coronavirus epidemic behind us.\\n\\nEarlier today, we also had a conference call led by Secretary Ben Carson and leaders from HUD about the President’s announcement yesterday that he is repurposing the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council to focus on the impact of the coronavirus on minority communities.\\xa0 Secretary Carson will convene the council tomorrow, and we’ll be reporting tomorrow afternoon on their progress.\\n\\nWe want to thank the more than 270 leaders of organizations dedicated to housing, homelessness, and improving the lives of people across our urban communities — not only for being with us today, for the way they have partnered with our administration and partnered with state and local officials to put the health of all of their constituencies first.\\n\\nAs the President mentioned, we’ll — you’ll receive a report that our task force received formally this week from Bill Bryan of the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security.\\xa0 He will outline, as the President said, encouraging news about the impact that heat and sunlight have on the coronavirus, which will increase the confidence that we feel about the coming summer.\\n\\nOn the subject of testing: At the present moment, we have reports of 4.93 million tests having been performed across America.\\xa0 And encouraging news: As states have been engaging commercial labs at a higher level across the country, yesterday our commercial lab system did more than 100,000 tests in a single day.\\xa0 So we’re beginning to activate all of the capacity.\\n\\nAnd tomorrow, at the President’s direction, our task force will convene a conference call with all of the nation’s governors to talk about the progress that they are making on testing.\\xa0 And we’re going to hear from governors about the practices that — and methods that they are employing to significantly increase testing following our briefing about capacity in laboratories this past Monday.\\n\\nFor instance, Governor Mike DeWine just announced that Ohio’s testing has been greatly expanded after the FDA approved Thermo Fisher’s new extraction reagent, saying, in his words, that the action, quote, “probably doubled, maybe even tripled testing in Ohio virtually overnight.”\\n\\nGovernor Tim Walz of Minnesota announced, along with the state’s healthcare system, the Mayo Clinic, and the University of Minnesota, what he described as a breakthrough for rapid, widespread testing — able to test more than 20,000 people using a molecular test per day.\\n\\nGovernor Kim Reynolds of Iowa launched the Test Iowa Initiative that will triple testing capacity by partnering with Nomi Health and DOMO.\\xa0 She also worked with the University of Iowa Hospitals to leverage further capacity.\\n\\nAnd Governor Eric Holcomb and Governor Andy Beshear, of Indiana and Kentucky respectively, both announced additional drive-through testing locations.\\n\\nOur priority has always been to focus first on those impacted by the coronavirus and then on those extraordinary healthcare workers ministering to their needs every day.\\xa0 And I know, Mr. President, how proud you are that our men and women in uniform have come alongside our healthcare workers in communities most impacted, and I know the American people are proud as well.\\n\\nAs of today, FEMA reports that 35,000 National Guard have been deployed across the country to aid in our coronavirus response.\\xa0 Governor Kevin Stitt of Ohio [Oklahoma] actually deployed the National Guard to hospitals across the state to evaluate protective equipment and hospital capacity and report it in to state emergency management and FEMA.\\n\\nAnd Governor Greg Abbott of Texas actually mobilized more than 1,200 National Guard and 45 teams to provide greater access to testing.\\n\\nAlong with the National Guard, at the President’s direction today, more than 4,500 active duty military doctors, nurses, and medical assistants have been deployed across the country.\\xa0 Yesterday, 1,013 medical professionals in our military were actually deployed to 19 hospitals in 7 states to support those amazing healthcare workers.\\n\\nAnd with 4.4 million more Americans filing for unemployment in the past week, I joined the President in welcoming passage in the House today of the Paycheck Protection Program.\\xa0 It’ll support working families.\\xa0 It’ll allow small businesses to keep people on the payroll for a period of two months.\\xa0 But it also, as the President requested, included $75 billion to assist hospitals across the country.\\n\\nAnd in that spirit, the President and I will continue to urge states across the country: Given the unique burden on hospitals, we are now encouraging states to restart elective surgeries, wherever possible — either statewide or on a county-by-county basis.\\xa0 We recognize the role elective surgeries play in finances for local hospitals and we’ll be working with states to enable that.\\n\\nIn that vein, Governor Doug Ducey exec- — issued an executive order not long ago, allowing elective surgeries beginning May 1 for hospitals that meet certain preparedness criteria.\\n\\nAnd Indiana’s governor, Eric Holcomb, is allowing elective clinical procedures to begin on April 21st.\\n\\nFinally, Mr. President, the task force received today our first report on state reopening plans.\\xa0 At the present moment, 16 states have released formal reopening plans.\\xa0 Thirteen of those were actually released since you unveiled the Opening Up America Guidelines to our governors and to the nation last week.\\n\\nAnd to your point, Mr. President, states are beginning to make those plans.\\xa0 And we’re encouraged to see so many states embracing the phased approach to reopening their economies that’s contemplated in our Guidelines for Opening Up America Again.\\n\\nFor instance, Governor Mike Parson of Missouri announced the “Show Me Strong” Recovery Plan as two initial phases intended to protect the most at-risk.\\n\\nGovernor Tom Wolf announced the Plan for Pennsylvania that would begin May 8th — will end a stay-at-home order for just portions of Pennsylvania.\\xa0 But the plan, again, requires regions to have fewer than 50 new positive cases per 100,000 for a period of 14 days, and it also lays out a phased reopening roadmap.\\n\\nGovernor Kate Brown of Oregon updated their framework for reopening, doing three phases — again, on a county-by-county basis.\\n\\nAnd Governor Brad Little of Idaho released “Rebound Idaho” in just the last few days that will consist of four phases and require specific criteria that Idaho and businesses need to meet to begin to reopen.\\n\\nMr.\\xa0 President, with the — with the Guidelines to Open Up America Again, states are making plans.\\xa0 And at your direction, our task force will continue to work very closely, providing them with the data, providing them with the resources to be able to implement those plans in a safe and responsible way.\\n\\nSo, with that, let me just end where I began, and to say thank you to the American people.\\xa0 The progress that we are seeing is a testament to what all of you have done; to our extraordinary healthcare workers; to a partnership between the federal government and to state and local official.\\xa0 And I’m confident it’s also owing to the prayers of millions of Americans each and every day.\\n\\nAll of that combined, we’re — we’re slowing the spread.\\xa0 We’re protecting the most vulnerable.\\xa0 We’re saving lives.\\xa0 And every single day, we are one day closer to opening up America again.\\n\\nWith that, Mr. President, I’d be pleased to call Bill forward.\\xa0 Bill Bryan leads the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security and now will make a presentation on their recent study.\\n\\nACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr.\\xa0 Vice President.\\xa0 Thank you, Mr.\\xa0 President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Bill.\\n\\nACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: — for this opportunity to do this today.\\n\\nGood afternoon everybody.\\xa0 My name is Bill Bryan and I lead the Science and Technology Directorate at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\\xa0 Over the last several months, we’ve intensified the Department’s R&D efforts to identify and deliver information that informs our response to COVID-19.\\xa0 S&T is working to identify, develop, deploy, and deploy the tools and information to support our response to this crisis.\\n\\nAs part of our efforts, we’re leveraging the unique capabilities of S&T’s National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center to study the biology of the COVID-19 virus.\\xa0 This center is a high-biocontainment laboratory located in Frederick, Maryland.\\xa0 It was established in the early 2000s, in response to the Amerithrax attacks, and where we study, characterize, analyze, and develop countermeasures for biological threats to the homeland.\\xa0 We work closely with the CDC, FDA, HHS, and also our Department of Defense colleagues and many others.\\n\\nYesterday, I shared the emerging results of our work that we’re doing now with the Coronavirus Task Force.\\xa0 And today, I would like to share certain trends that we believe are important.\\n\\nIf I may have the first slide, please.\\xa0 And while that’s coming up, our most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that solar light appears to have on killing the virus — both surfaces and in the air.\\xa0 We’ve seen a similar effect with both temperature and humidity as well, where increasing the temperature and humidity or both is generally less favorable to the virus.\\n\\nSo let me illustrate with this first slide.\\xa0 If you look to the right, you’ll see that term “half-life,” with a bunch of timestamps on there.\\n\\nFirst, let me tell you what a “half-life” is.\\xa0 We don’t measure the virus as far as how long we live on the surface; we have to measure the decay of the virus in terms of its half-life, because we don’t know certain elements.\\xa0 We don’t know how much a person expectorates when he — when he spits — right? — when he sneezes, whatever the case may be.\\xa0 We don’t know how much virus is in there.\\xa0 So it’s — that has a long — a bearing on how long the virus is going to be alive and active.\\xa0 So we measure it in half life because half-life doesn’t change.\\n\\nSo if you look at an 18-hour half-life, what you’re basically saying is that every 18 hours, the virus — it’s the life of the virus is cut in half.\\xa0 So if you start with 1,000 particles of the virus, in 18 hours, you’re down to 500.\\xa0 And 18 hours after that, you’re down to 250, and so on and so forth.\\xa0 That’s important, as I explain in the rest of the chart.\\n\\nIf you look at the first three lines, when you see the word “surface,” we’re talking about nonporous surfaces: door handles, stainless steel.\\xa0 And if you look at the — as the temperature increases, as the humidity increases, with no sun involved, you can see how drastically the half-life goes down on that virus.\\xa0 So the virus is dying at a much more rapid pace, just from exposure to higher temperatures and just from exposure to humidity.\\n\\nIf you look at the fourth line, you inject summer — the sunlight into that.\\xa0 You inject UV rays into that.\\xa0 The same effects on line two — as 70 to 35 degrees with 80 percent humidity on the surface.\\xa0 And look at line four, but now you inject the sun.\\xa0 The half-life goes from six hours to two minutes.\\xa0 That’s how much of an impact UV rays has on the virus.\\n\\nThe last two lines are aerosols.\\xa0 What does it do in the air?\\xa0 We have a very unique capability — I was discussing this with the President prior to coming out; he wanted me to convey it to you — on how we do this.\\xa0 I believe we’re the only lab in the country that has this capability.\\n\\nBut if you can imagine a Home Depot bucket — a five-gallon Home Depot bucket — we’re able to take a particle — and this was developed and designed by our folks at the NBACC.\\xa0 We’re able to take a particle of a virus and suspend it in the air inside of this drum and hit it with various temperatures, various humidity levels, multiple different kinds of environmental conditions, to include sunlight.\\xa0 And we’re able to measure the decay of that virus while it’s suspended in the air.\\xa0 This is how we do our aerosol testing.\\n\\nWe worked with John Hopkin Applied Physics Lab, and we actually developed a larger drum to do actually more testing.\\xa0 And it’s four times the size of that.\\xa0 So this is the capability that we bring to this effort.\\n\\nSo, in summary, within the conditions we’ve tested to date, the virus in droplets of saliva survives best in indoors and dry conditions.\\xa0 The virus does not survive as well in droplets of saliva.\\xa0 And that’s important because a lot of testing being done is not necessarily being done, number one, with the COVID-19 virus, and number two, in saliva or respiratory fluids.\\n\\nAnd thirdly, the virus dies the quickest in the presence of direct sunlight under these conditions.\\xa0 And when you — when you look at that chart, look at the aerosol as you breathe it; you put it in a room, 70 to 75 degrees, 20 percent humidity, low humidity, it lasts — the half-life is about an hour.\\xa0 But you get outside, and it cuts down to a minute and a half.\\xa0 A very significant difference when it gets hit with UV rays.\\n\\nAnd, Mr. President, while there are many unknown links in the COVID-19 transmission chain, we believe these trends can support practical decision making to lower the risks associated with the virus.\\n\\nIf I can have my next slide.\\n\\nAnd when that — while that comes up, you’ll see a number of some practical applications.\\xa0 For example, increasing the temperature and humidity of potentially contaminated indoor spaces appears to reduce the stability of the virus.\\xa0 And extra care may be warranted for dry environments that do not have exposure to solar light.\\n\\nWe’re also testing disinfectants readily available.\\xa0 We’ve tested bleach, we’ve tested isopropyl alcohol on the virus, specifically in saliva or in respiratory fluids.\\xa0 And I can tell you that bleach will kill the virus in five minutes; isopropyl alcohol will kill the virus in 30 seconds, and that’s with no manipulation, no rubbing — just spraying it on and letting it go.\\xa0 You rub it and it goes away even faster.\\xa0 We’re also looking at other disinfectants, specifically looking at the COVID-19 virus in saliva.\\n\\nThis is not the end of our work as we continue to characterize this virus and integrate our findings into practical applications to mitigate exposure and transmission.\\xa0 I would like to thank the President and thank the Vice President for their ongoing support and leadership to the department and for their work in addressing this pandemic.\\xa0 I would also like to thank the scientists, not only in S&T and the NBACC, but to the larger scientific and R&D community.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Bill.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Bryan —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 So I asked Bill a question that probably some of you are thinking of, if you’re totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting.\\xa0 So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light — and I think you said that that hasn’t been checked, but you’re going to test it.\\xa0 And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way, and I think you said you’re going to test that too.\\xa0 It sounds interesting.\\n\\nACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:\\xa0 We’ll get to the right folks who could.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute.\\xa0 One minute.\\xa0 And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning.\\xa0 Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs.\\xa0 So it would be interesting to check that.\\xa0 So, that, you’re going to have to use medical doctors with.\\xa0 But it sounds — it sounds interesting to me.\\n\\nSo we’ll see.\\xa0 But the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute, that’s — that’s pretty powerful.\\n\\nSteve, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You’re saying that the country will be in a better place by early summer.\\xa0 Does that mean you’re going to need to extend the social distancing guidelines until then?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we may, and we may go beyond that.\\xa0 We’re going to have to see where it is.\\xa0 And I think people are going to know.\\xa0 You’re going to know.\\xa0 I’m going to know.\\xa0 I think people are going to know just out of common sense.\\xa0 At some point, we won’t have to do that.\\xa0 But until we feel it’s safe, we’re going to be extending.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You said you have 23 cases where new cases — 23 states where new cases are on decline.\\xa0 What does that mean about when the country can be safely reopened to a more normal point?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, but it means we’re going to watch those cases very carefully.\\xa0 I think we’ve all gotten very good at it.\\xa0 We’ve gotten good at tracing.\\xa0 We see where the cases are, where they’re going, and we’re going to be watching it.\\xa0 And it’s called “containment.”\\xa0 At a certain point, we’re going to be able to contain.\\n\\nAnd, you know, when you see this, a lot of people have been talking about summer.\\xa0 Maybe this is one of the reasons.\\xa0 We’ve — I once mentioned that maybe it does go away with heat and light.\\xa0 And people didn’t like that statement very much.\\xa0 The — the fake news didn’t like it at all.\\xa0 And I just threw it out as a suggestion, but it seems like that’s the case, because when it’s on a surface that would last for a long time, when that surface is outside, it goes away very quickly.\\xa0 It dies very quickly with the sun.\\n\\nYeah, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You said yesterday that you’re going to look into Senator McConnell’s suggestion for allowing states to declare bankruptcy versus the aid —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, we’ll look into it, and I have been looking into it.\\xa0 I’ve been talking to a lot of the different senators, but I don’t want to talk about it now.\\xa0 That was a very interesting presentation.\\n\\nGo ahead, Jon.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, I wanted to talk about McConnell’s suggestion that aid to the states amounts to a blue —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0I just told you I’m not talking about it now.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — to a blue-state (inaudible).\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’ll talk about it later.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’d like to talk about something that, right now, is of more interest to people.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Could I ask Mr. Bryan a question?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 When you started your presentation, you described this as an emerging result.\\xa0 Does this mean your study is conclusive?\\xa0 Is there more work to do?\\n\\nACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:\\xa0 We’re continuing with that.\\xa0 For example, on the aerosol side, you notice the figures were 20 percent humidity.\\xa0 We’re looking at higher humidity levels.\\xa0 We would expect that would even have a greater impact on the virus.\\xa0 We’re looking at other types of disinfectants.\\xa0 And — and so we’re — this is a — as a scientific community, we’re continuing to study the virus to understand its characteristics.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Bryan, can you explain why some hotspots we’ve seen in the U.S. are hot and humid, like New Orleans, for example?\\n\\nACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:\\xa0 Let me explain — if you look at the coronavirus as a chain with many links, what we’ve done through our study is we’ve identified some of the weak links in that chain, that the virus — the transmission of the virus depends upon.\\xa0 We identified that heat and humidity is a weakness in that chain.\\xa0 We’ve identified that sunlight, solar light, UV rays is a weakness in that chain.\\xa0 That doesn’t take away the other activities — the guidance from the White House, the guidance from the CDC and others on the actions and steps that people need to take to protect themselves.\\n\\nThis is just another — another tool in our tool belt, right?\\xa0 Another — another weapon in the fight that we can add to it and, in the summer, we know that summer-like conditions are going to create an environment where the transmission can be decreased.\\xa0 And that’s an opportunity for us to get ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But I — just, can I ask about — the President mentioned the idea of cleaners, like bleach and isopropyl alcohol you mentioned.\\xa0 There’s no scenario that that could be injected into a person, is there?\\xa0 I mean —\\n\\nACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:\\xa0 No, I’m here to talk about the findings that we had in the study.\\xa0 We won’t do that within that lab and our lab.\\xa0 So —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It wouldn’t be through injection.\\xa0 We’re talking about through almost a cleaning, sterilization of an area.\\xa0 Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t work.\\xa0 But it certainly has a big effect if it’s on a stationary object.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Bryant, are we simplifying it too much by saying that it’d be better with the warmer weather and the sun coming out more and more, that people would be outside than staying inside their home, confined to the four walls of their house?\\n\\nACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:\\xa0 It would be irresponsible for us to say that we feel that the summer is just going to totally kill the virus and that if it’s a free-for-all and that people ignore those guidelines.\\xa0 That is not the case.\\n\\nWe have an opportunity, though, to get ahead with what we know now and factor that into the decision making for what opens and what doesn’t.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But so are you saying, on surfaces, the heat, the hot summer, and whatever other conditions — humidity and lack of humidity — that that would have an impact so that on surfaces, where it can be picked up, it will die fairly quickly in the summer, whereas in the winter, it wouldn’t die so quickly?\\n\\nACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:\\xa0 Yes, Mr. President.\\xa0 When it’s exposed to UV rays — take playground equipment, for example: The UV rays hitting a piece of playground equipment will kill the virus when it hits that — when it hits on the playground equipment.\\xa0 But underneath, where the sun does not get, if someone touched that and had it on their hands, it could still be there, right?\\xa0 Because it has to be in direct light of the UV rays.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 If it’s on somebody’s hands, right?\\n\\nACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And they haven’t touched their face and all of the things that we’ve all been —\\n\\nACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:\\xa0 If it’s exposed to the sun, it’ll —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I know, but if they’re outside — right — and their hands are exposed to the sun, will that kill it as though it were on a piece of metal or something else?\\n\\nACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:\\xa0 Not — I don’t want to say it will at the same rate, because it’s a non-porous surface.\\xa0 But what we do know — what we do know is that we looked at the worst-case scenario, and the virus lives longer on non-porous surfaces.\\xa0 So porous surfaces, it doesn’t look quite as long.\\xa0 So, in theory, what you said is correct.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 This is sort of semi-non-porous, right?\\xa0 This, right?\\n\\nACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:\\xa0 That’s true.\\xa0 Yes, Mr. President.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Bryan, how can the governors —\\n\\n(Cross-talk.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Wait, wait, wait, wait.\\xa0 Okay, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 One at a time.\\xa0 Mr. Bryan, how should governors who are opening their states, working on that, will incorporate the findings of this study into those guidelines?\\n\\nACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:\\xa0 I would leave that up to the governors.\\xa0 This is a —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What was your advice?\\n\\nACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:\\xa0 This is a decision — this factors into their decision process.\\n\\nAs I mentioned, with knowing this knowledge and having this knowledge, as we continue to study and further know what the virus does and how it reacts, it could impact the way a governor will look at when he opens in a state, how he opens it, in what environments these things are opened up.\\xa0 But I leave that up to the governors to make that decision.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Obviously, at the moment, the advice is stay at home.\\xa0 By the summer, could we be flipping that and saying you’d be much better off being outside with UV rays or the humidity that Washington brings in August?\\n\\nACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:\\xa0 I would not go contrary to the guidance that have been issued right now.\\xa0 I think, though, to tell you that if — if I’m having an event with my family, I’m doing it in the driveway or in the backyard, not inside the house with my children.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 In fact, I’m thinking about moving outside to the Rose Garden.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 No, it’s a very interesting question, actually.\\n\\nOkay.\\xa0 Please, go ahead.\\xa0 In the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Bryan, how much more research — how much more time would it take to have conclusive results that could be used here?\\xa0 You said these were emerging results?\\n\\nACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:\\xa0 We — we first were able to receive the virus back in February, is when we started testing.\\xa0 And it is a science-based approach.\\xa0 Science is a process; the doctor can attest to that.\\xa0 It doesn’t necessarily line up with goals and targets and other things.\\xa0 It is what it is.\\xa0 But we are now starting to get results. \\xa0And — and we’re — every week or two weeks, we’re starting to find out something new and something different.\\n\\nAnd in talking to the task force and the Vice President, he’s already asked us to come to him every time we come up with some new discoveries that we could be — that we could share to the public.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Phil?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, sir, have you compared notes with your counterparts and other foreign governments or in private industry who might have been studying the same thing?\\xa0 And do their findings show the same result that you found here?\\n\\nACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:\\xa0 We have.\\xa0 We do have a very good partnership with a lot of our allies.\\xa0 We work closely with them on this particular topic.\\xa0 We actually authored a document called the Master Questions List.\\xa0 If you go to DHS S&T’s website, we’ve already had about 17,000 hits on this document.\\xa0 It actually outlines what all the countries in the world are doing to fill the certain gaps of knowledge that don’t exist within the virus and what we do know.\\n\\nAnd that is really what targets and drives the science community to say, “All right, what don’t we know now, so we don’t duplicate what other people have done?”\\xa0 So we’ve championed that document, it’s well referenced, and I would encourage you to look at that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And we are working with other countries on vaccines, as you know.\\n\\nYeah.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thanks, Mr. President.\\xa0 If there is a summer ebb with this virus, what would the federal government need to do to take advantage of that time?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Say it?\\xa0 In the beginning — what?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Oh, so if there is a summer, sort of, ebb with this virus, what would the federal government need to do to take advantage of that time to be better prepared for a possible resurgence in the fall than we were the first time?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I’ll tell you one thing: I think a lot of people are going to go outside all of a sudden.\\xa0 People that didn’t want to go outside, they’ll be going.\\n\\nThis was a — to me this is very — really, a very interesting meeting.\\xa0 We covered it in great detail.\\xa0 And these are incredible people at that — we could call it a laboratory, because that’s essentially what it is.\\xa0 It’s a super laboratory.\\xa0 It’s a lot of things going on in that laboratory.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Right, but what would you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 A lot of very interesting things going on in that laboratory.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What would you and other areas that the government need to do on testing, for example, or other things like that to be prepared if it came back in the fall?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure, Mike.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How would you take advantage of the summer?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s — it’s actually a very good question.\\xa0 It’s something the task force already has begun discussing.\\xa0 That we are — if — a combination of factors.\\n\\nLet me say again: As states put into practice the Guidelines to Open Up America Again, implement safe and responsible plans to open up their economies along the lines that the President unveiled a week ago today; as people continue to properly exercise social distancing, as is recommended in each phase, that, in combination with some of these findings, could well give us a summer respite from the coronavirus.\\n\\nAnd our team is already speaking about working on a continuous basis through this summer.\\xa0 Every single day we’re increasing testing.\\xa0 Every single day, air bridge flights are coming into the country.\\xa0 There are — I can promise you, at the President’s direction, there will be no letting up on — on making sure that our hospitals have the equipment, have the personal protective supplies for medical personnel.\\n\\nThere’ll be no letting up on the development of therapeutics by our great pharmaceutical companies that are driving toward a vaccine as soon as it is possible to make available to the public.\\xa0 And there’ll be no letting up on continuing to scale testing — already, more than anyone in the world.\\xa0 But by next fall, we’ll have a broad range of testing, a variety of different means.\\n\\nAnd that’s why we say with confidence that should the coronavirus reemerge at any point next fall or next winter, we will be prepared to deal with it, identify it, do the contact tracing and isolation to ensure that — that we — we deal with this epidemic in the manner that we — that we deal with infectious diseases.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, on the subject of medical research: Why have you stopped promoting hydroxychloroquine as a cure?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I haven’t at all.\\xa0 I haven’t at all.\\xa0 What are you say- — we’ll see what happens.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You haven’t talked about it in several days.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’ve had a lot of very good results and we had some results that perhaps aren’t so good.\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 I just read about one, but I also read many times good.\\xa0 So I haven’t at all.\\xa0 And it’s a — it’s a great — for malaria, for lupus, for other things.\\xa0 And we’ll see what it is.\\n\\nBut, I guess, Deborah, they have many, many studies going on on that.\\xa0 So we’ll — we’ll be able to learn.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have you looked at the veteran study that shows that — that the death rate is higher —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I have not.\\xa0 I haven’t seen it.\\xa0 I have not seen it.\\n\\nGo ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, we’re now over 26 million new jobless claims over five weeks.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How — the Vice President talked about this summer getting better.\\xa0 But how — what do your economists tell you about the time it’s going to take to you and the U.S. to create the jobs back?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I know a lot about economists.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 August?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 September?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 October?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, let me go.\\xa0 We — we know the rest of the question, right?\\xa0 So I — I know a lot about economists, and the answer is they have no idea.\\xa0 I think I have as good an idea as anybody, and I think our economy will start to pick up very substantially, as soon as the states get open.\\n\\nAnd that’s happening as we speak, and it’s actually very exciting, and people are just — just thrilled to see it, because our country has to get back to work.\\xa0 They want to get back to work.\\xa0 You see that, whether it’s a demonstration or just in talking to people.\\xa0 They’re going to get back to work, and they’re going to get back to work very fast.\\n\\nStates are advanced.\\xa0 I look at Gavin Newson — was — Newsom was very nice today.\\xa0 He wrote a beautiful statement about — we sent him a lot of — a lot of things that he needed.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 Things — different things that he needed.\\xa0 We got — we got it taken care of.\\xa0 They’ve done very well in California, as you know.\\xa0 They’re doing really well in Florida.\\xa0 They’re doing well in a lot of places.\\xa0 New York and New Jersey got hit very hard.\\xa0 They’re doing very well.\\n\\nI spoke again with Governor Cuomo, with Governor Murphy.\\xa0 They’re doing — they’re doing a great job.\\xa0 And here’s the thing: We have to see.\\xa0 They got hit hard.\\xa0 Everyone close together — tight in.\\xa0 People don’t realize New Jersey is very tight.\\xa0 You realize that because you’ve been covering it for a long time, but very tight.\\xa0 New York obviously is very tight.\\xa0 They’re doing a terrific job.\\n\\nI — I think for the most part — I’ll be able to tell you when it’s all over, but a lot of the governors have done a really terrific job.\\xa0 Some I don’t think have, to be honest.\\xa0 But we’ll be talking about that in future.\\n\\nYes, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 In a new interview today with Time Magazine, Dr. Fauci said that the U.S. is not in a situation where we can say we are where we want to be, with regard to testing capacity.\\xa0 He said we need much more testing capacity, as well as tests.\\xa0 So why do you keep saying we have a tremendous testing capacity?\\xa0 And do we have a national strategy that goes beyond tracking just what the states are doing?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The answer is yes.\\xa0 And the answer is — as you know, and as I’ve said many times — we’re very advanced in testing.\\xa0 Other countries are calling us to find out what are we doing.\\n\\nAnd, by the way, within two weeks, you’ll see numbers and you’ll see different forms of testing — just like we came up with the Abbott Laboratories machine, which gives it to you in five minutes — that everybody wants.\\xa0 Everybody is asking, “Can we get that?”\\xa0 But you can only make them so fast.\\xa0 But, as you know, we’ve done more testing than every other nation combined, and that’s a big statement.\\n\\nAnd, you know, when they talk about different tests and different things, we’re also a bigger nation than most.\\xa0 And so, when they look at statistics — because, statistically, we’re doing phenomenally, in terms of mortality, in terms of all of the different elements that you can judge.\\xa0 When you look, Germany and ourselves are doing very well.\\n\\nWe are very accurate in the reporting of numbers.\\xa0 In fact, I’ll go a step further.\\xa0 As you know, in New York, they actually added quite a few deaths to a list that was done in New York.\\xa0 And they added a number of deaths.\\xa0 We’re very, very — highly accurate.\\n\\nAnd then you’ll look at certain lists of other countries.\\xa0 Some are so obvious just to look at, where obviously the number is ridiculous, in the form of low, because they’re not accurate counts.\\xa0 They’re not even close to accurate counts.\\xa0 In fact, they’re insulting to look at them.\\n\\nSo we’ve done very well.\\xa0 Again, testing — we’re doing very well on testing.\\xa0 We’ve tested far more than anybody else anywhere in the world.\\xa0 And within a short period of time, you’ll be hearing about new tests that are coming out that are going to be incredible.\\n\\nSteve, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you agree with Dr. Fauci that we’re just not there yet?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I don’t agree with him on that.\\xa0 No, I think we’re doing a great job in testing.\\xa0 I don’t agree.\\xa0 If he said that, I don’t agree with him.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you considering ways to get — to ramp up production of that Abbott rapid test?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, well, they’re doing it.\\xa0 I’ll tell you, Steve, they — they’re doing it at a level that they’ve never done it before.\\xa0 Abbott is a great company.\\xa0 It’s a very big, highly respected company.\\xa0 They came up with this machine where you do it — I’ve done it both ways.\\xa0 I’ve done it this way and I didn’t like it.\\xa0 And I’ve done it the Abbott way, where you literally just touch and, five minutes later, you know the answer.\\n\\nAnd we use them in the White House.\\xa0 I think you folks have been given that opportunity, which is much more pleasant than the first way that they looked at you.\\xa0 Right?\\n\\nWe’re making them — hundreds of thousands of machines.\\xa0 The advantage to the other tests and the laboratory tests is we can get millions and millions of those tests done.\\xa0 It takes a day or two days.\\xa0 But — you know, because it’s really a delivery situation, more than anything else.\\xa0 The test itself goes quickly once it gets to the laboratory.\\n\\nBut as we have found and as we have, I think, shown everybody in the room, we have many laboratories.\\xa0 We have thou- — we have so many laboratories.\\xa0 Nobody — nobody — a lot of the governors did not know that we have this capacity, but we have many laboratories all over our country.\\xa0 Every state has laboratories and some have a lot of them.\\xa0 So I think we will — we will come up with things as time goes by.\\n\\nAgain, when I started, we ended up — we — we started with nothing, essentially.\\xa0 What — we started with a broken test, a test that didn’t work.\\xa0 We started with a test that did very few people, not millions of people.\\n\\nThe problem is, if we did 350- — if we did 350 million tests, one for each person, the media would say, “Oh, you should have done two for each person.”\\xa0 No matter what you do, it doesn’t make any difference.\\n\\nIt’s just like the ventilators.\\xa0 I talk about it all the time.\\xa0 Nobody ever mentions ventilators.\\xa0 One of the hardest things are ventilators.\\xa0 And now we’re making thousands a week — thousands of ventilators.\\xa0 And they’re calling from Mexico; they’re calling from many countries.\\n\\nI’ve received today four calls.\\xa0 “Would it be possible to send ventilators?”\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 I got four calls today.\\xa0 I got three calls yesterday.\\xa0 No country is equipped like we are.\\xa0 We have 11 — we have 11 different places making ventilators.\\xa0 Our country, as you know, doesn’t need them now.\\xa0 Our governors are very happy.\\n\\nBut that’s different than test, because with a test you can always say, “Oh, we — we need more.”\\xa0 No, I think we’ve done incredibly well with — obviously, with ventilators.\\xa0 We’re — we also have 500 million masks — 500 million masks that are very shortly going to be here.\\xa0 We’ve made millions of masks.\\xa0 We have ordered millions of masks that have arrived and been distributed.\\n\\nWe gave one hospital in New York City 300,000 masks.\\xa0 Before the virus, they were using 10,000.\\xa0 And now we got them 300,000, and they got rid of them very quick, which I — quickly — which I sort of say, “How did that happen?\\xa0 Why?”\\xa0 Because they became very valuable — the masks.\\xa0 I say, “How did that happen?”\\n\\nBut we got — we have — we’ve done an amazing job, and we’ve worked with the governors.\\xa0 And when the governors weren’t able — again, they’re the first line — when they weren’t able to get something — like ventilators, they couldn’t get ventilators.\\xa0 They could’ve bought them.\\xa0 You could have bought them, but most of them — many of them chose not to.\\xa0 So they all needed ventilators.\\xa0 We got the job done.\\n\\nWe have — I’ll be introducing the team when we’re finished with this whole nightmare, this whole curse, this whole plague.\\xa0 But the team that worked on the ventilators was incredible.\\xa0 And the team that work — and it’s a little bit interchangeable, but the team that’s working on the testing is truly an incredible team.\\xa0 These are brilliant people.\\xa0 And they’re doing it for the country; they’re not doing it for other reasons.\\n\\nSome have been very successful.\\xa0 They’re doing it for the country.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The House has now passed, since you were here, the relief bill.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Great.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 As you know —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’ll be signing it probably tonight.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 As you know, there’s no aid to states and localities in that bill.\\xa0 Mitch McConnell, of course, has talked about states seeking bankruptcy protection.\\n\\nHe’s also — his office referred to this as a — the idea of aiding states as a “blue state” bailout.\\xa0 What do you — what do say to that?\\xa0 Do you agree with that?\\xa0 Or do you agree with Governor Cuomo that that is a vicious attack on these states that have been hit by —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know if it was a vicious attack, but certainly some people do look at it that way.\\xa0 I’ve spoken to Mitch about it; I’ve spoken to numerous senators about it.\\xa0 And we’re working with senators that are on the other side of the issue, and we’ll see what happens.\\xa0 But we’re looking to do what’s right for the people of this country.\\xa0 We’re looking to do what’s right for a particular state.\\xa0 And we’ll see what happens.\\n\\nBut it’s certainly the next thing we’re going to be discussing because some states have — in all fairness, Jon, some states have not done very well for many years, long before the virus came.\\xa0 You know, you can’t blame the plague — this horrible plague that came in and, all of a sudden — you know, they can’t blame that.\\xa0 You look at Illinois — he’s got a lot of problems long before the virus came in.\\xa0 And so we’ll be talking about it.\\xa0 It’ll be a subject for a period of time.\\n\\nAnd right now, we’ve — we’ve made this incredible deal for the workers and for small business.\\xa0 And I’m very happy that Harvard didn’t get covered.\\xa0 We actually never sent them the check.\\xa0 But they were very nice about it.\\xa0 We never sent them the money.\\xa0 The old-fashioned way is the check; the new way is send them the money.\\xa0 And we didn’t send them the money.\\n\\nAnd — but they were very understanding and they were very nice about it.\\xa0 So was Princeton, so was Stanford, so were a number of other schools that you just don’t associate with this money.\\xa0 So were big companies, as you know.\\xa0 You know, many of them.\\xa0 It was a relatively small amount of money compared to the whole.\\xa0 A very small amount of money compared.\\xa0 But we want it to be fair.\\xa0 We want it to go to the people that it’s supposed to go to.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But are you open to this idea of state and local —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m open.\\xa0 I’m open.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I mean, are these — are these —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m open to ideas that are going to be great for the people of this country.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Specifically that idea?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And if we can help states, we’re always going to help states.\\n\\nNow, there’s different ways of helping states.\\xa0 Some ways are better than others.\\xa0 So we’re looking.\\xa0 It is interesting that the states that are in trouble do happen to be blue.\\xa0 It is interesting, you know, if you look around.\\xa0 I mean, the states that seem to have the problem happen to be Democrat.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, New York and New Jersey got hit by this, you know, by this virus really hard, and Massachusetts —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, but New York and New Jersey were in a lot of trouble long before the plague came.\\xa0 I mean, they were — you know, they had a lot of problems long before the plague came.\\xa0 I spoke with Governor Cuomo about it, spoke to Governor Murphy about it.\\xa0 I spoke with Gavin Newsom about it.\\xa0 And we — I’m speaking to a lot of people about it, because it’s probably going to be the next thing on the list.\\n\\nA lot of people understand very well what Mitch is saying, and they also understand the other side of the — the problem.\\xa0 And I’ll be speaking about it.\\xa0 We’re going to do the right thing for our country.\\xa0 The right thing for our country and the right thing for a lot of great people.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, Mr. President, after the presentation we just saw about the heat and the humidity, is it dangerous for you to make people think they would be safe by going outside in the heat, considering that so many people are dying in Florida, considering that this virus has had an outbreak in Singapore, places that are hot and —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, here we go.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — are humid?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Here we go.\\xa0 The new — the new headline is: “Trump Asks People to go Outside.\\xa0 That’s Dangerous.”\\xa0 Here we go.\\xa0 Same old group.\\xa0 You ready?\\xa0 I hope people enjoy the sun.\\xa0 And if it has an impact, that’s great.\\xa0 I’m just hearing this — not really for the first time.\\xa0 I mean, there’s been a rumor that — you know, a very nice rumor — that you go outside in the sun, or you have heat and it does have an effect on other viruses.\\n\\nBut now we get it from one of the great laboratories of the world.\\xa0 I have to say, it covers a lot more territory than just this.\\xa0 This is — this is probably an easy thing, relatively speaking, for you.\\n\\nI would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there’s any way that you can apply light and heat to cure.\\xa0 You know — but if you could.\\xa0 And maybe you can, maybe you can’t.\\xa0 Again, I say, maybe you can, maybe you can’t.\\xa0 I’m not a doctor.\\xa0 But I’m like a person that has a good you know what.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But, sir, you’re the President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Deborah, have you ever heard of that?\\xa0 The heat and the light, relative to certain viruses, yes, but relative to this virus?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Not as a treatment.\\xa0 I mean, certainly fever —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 — is a good thing.\\xa0 When you have a fever, it helps your body respond.\\xa0 But not as — I’ve not seen heat or (inaudible).\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think it’s a great thing to look at.\\xa0 I mean, you know.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But respectfully, sir, you’re the President.\\xa0 And people tuning into these briefings, they want to get information and guidance and want to know what to do.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Hey — hey, Phil.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 They’re not looking for a rumor.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Hey, Phil.\\xa0 I’m the President and you’re fake news.\\xa0 And you know what I’ll say to you?\\xa0 I’ll say it very nicely.\\xa0 I know you well.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Why do you say that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I know you well.\\n\\nBecause I know the guy; I see what he writes.\\xa0 He’s a total faker.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 He’s a good reporter.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So, are you ready?\\xa0 Are you ready?\\xa0 Are you ready?\\xa0 It’s just a suggestion from a brilliant lab by a very, very smart, perhaps brilliant, man.\\xa0 He’s talking about sun.\\xa0 He’s talking about heat.\\xa0 And you see the numbers.\\xa0 So that’s it; that’s all I have.\\xa0 I’m just here to present talent.\\xa0 I’m here to present ideas, because we want ideas to get rid of this thing.\\xa0 And if heat is good and if sunlight is good, that’s a great thing as far as I’m concerned.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you talked a moment ago about vaccines and that we’re close.\\xa0 How close, do you think?\\xa0 The Oxford University study says they could have one by September.\\xa0 Do you think the pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They could have one of what?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 They could — they could have a vaccine ready —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — for testing by September.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oxford is one.\\xa0 Johnson & Johnson is working.\\xa0 They’re also working together.\\xa0 You have many companies working together on a vaccine.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But then, do you think they’ll scale — they can scale up production and the pharmaceutical companies will be able to do that quickly?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, we’ll scale it up.\\xa0 If we had a vaccine, it’ll be scaled up very quickly.\\xa0 In fact, some of the companies — Johnson & Johnson is one — is scaling up already, before they have the final answer.\\xa0 A number of companies are doing that.\\xa0 You’ll save a lot of time.\\xa0 The normal is you scale up after.\\n\\nI have to say, the FDA has been fantastic.\\xa0 Stephen Hahn — Dr. Hahn — has been fantastic.\\xa0 They’re moving along rapidly.\\xa0 Rapidly.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Would you say — would you put a timescale on when you think this will —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I don’t want to put a timescale because then the — the media, the so-called — so-called “media” — “lamestream” media will say, “He said a time.”\\xa0 I don’t want to say times, because every time I say a time, if you don’t hit it, they’ll say — so I don’t want to talk about time.\\n\\nBut I will say that there’s been tremendous progress made over the last month.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Could I just ask a very quick question?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You spoke to Boris Johnson this week.\\xa0 I just wonder how —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I did.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — how he sounded, how he was.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I did.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 When do you think he’ll be back at work?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He called me a few days ago.\\xa0 I will tell you, he sounded incredible.\\xa0 I was actually surprised.\\xa0 I thought he’d be like, “Oh, Donald, how are you…”\\xa0 He was ready to go.\\xa0 I could — I’m very surprised to tell you this: It’s like the old Boris.\\xa0 Tremendous energy.\\xa0 Tremendous drive.\\xa0 I was very surprised, because he called me almost, you know, pretty close to when he got out of the hospital.\\n\\nI think he’s doing great.\\xa0 I think he’s doing great.\\xa0 He was so sharp and energetic.\\xa0 Pretty incredible.\\xa0 He’s an incredible guy.\\n\\nHe’s a friend of ours and — and a friend of mine.\\xa0 He loves our country.\\xa0 He loves his country a lot.\\xa0 But he loves our country.\\xa0 He respects our country.\\xa0 And they’re lucky to have him over there.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you, a couple days ago, said that you might reach out to Kim Jong Un directly, but also that you were working to find out if those reports about him being in possible medical trouble were true.\\xa0 I’m wondering if you’ve either —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I hope he’s not in medical trouble.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I hope he’s —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — have you heard anything from North Korea or —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’ve gotten along very well with him.\\xa0 And you know, here we are.\\xa0 You would have been in a war with North Korea if I didn’t get elected President.\\xa0 Remember, I was going to be the one that took us into war, with my first day in office.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 Here we are.\\xa0 Look at what’s happened.\\xa0 Withdrawal.\\xa0 We’re bringing people home.\\xa0 We’re not going to serve as policemen all over the world.\\xa0 I don’t want to be policemen all over the world.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But have you been able to leverage that relationship?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And yet I’ve rebuilt our military to a level that it’s never been built at before.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have you been able to get more information?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But it’s never recognized by the fake news.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have you been able to use that relationship to get more information about his status?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Uh, I think the report was incorrect.\\xa0 Let me just put it that way.\\xa0 I think the report was done by a network that was incorrect.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you blame —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m hearing they used old documents.\\xa0 But I — that’s what I hear.\\xa0 I hear the report was an incorrect report.\\xa0 I hope it was an incorrect report.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 When was the last time you heard from him?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t want to say.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Since you pointed to me, just a quick question about that.\\xa0 So you haven’t made any contact, though? \\xa0Just to make sure.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 With who?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The North Koreans.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t want to say.\\xa0 I won’t say that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay, so —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We have a good relationship with North Korea — as good as you can have.\\xa0 I mean, we have a good relationship with North Korea.\\xa0 I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un, and I hope he’s okay.\\xa0 And somebody would say, “Oh, that’s terrible.”\\xa0 No, it’s not terrible.\\xa0 I hope he’s okay.\\xa0 And I think it was a fake report done by CNN.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So can I ask you a question?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 What do you have?\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No, I would like —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, that’s enough.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I ask —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But that wasn’t my question.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The problem is you don’t write the truth, so, you know, as far as I’m concerned —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What are you referencing?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — I want to go — I want to go to the next question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But can I ask you a question about Rick Bright?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, not CNN, please.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The White House has not responded —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You don’t —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — to these allegations —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I told you —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — to Rick Bright.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — CNN is fake news.\\xa0 Don’t talk to me.\\n\\nGo ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 He says he was — but he says he was retaliated against and that’s why he was removed from his job.\\xa0 Do you have a response to that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, next question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I have two questions.\\xa0 One on behalf of a colleague who is not here because of social distancing.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Just ask one, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 First one: Could you talk about your decision-making process on — with the governor of Georgia?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 About what?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You, yesterday, said —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The controversy?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, you know, you — no.\\xa0 You said yesterday that you told the governor of Georgia —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I did.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — you were concerned about —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I had a good talk with the governor of Georgia.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But there are reports that, earlier in the week, you spoke and you did not convey this kind of message.\\xa0 Was there a change in your thinking?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I did convey the message.\\xa0 I didn’t like the fact that he’s leaving certain things — I want the states to open more than he does — much more than he does.\\xa0 But I didn’t like to see spas at this early stage, nor did the doctors.\\xa0 Is that a correct statement, Deborah?\\n\\nI didn’t like to see spas opening, frankly.\\xa0 I didn’t like to see a lot of things happening.\\xa0 And I wasn’t happy with it.\\xa0 And I wasn’t happy with Brian Kemp.\\xa0 I wasn’t at all happy, because — and I could have done something about it if I wanted to, but I’m saying let the governors do it.\\xa0 But I wasn’t happy with Brian Kemp.\\xa0 Spas, beauty parlors, tattoo parlors — no, that’s — that —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But did your thinking change after —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And, by the way, I want them to open — excuse me.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — a conversation with your medical experts?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Excuse me.\\xa0 I want them to open, and I want him to open as soon as possible.\\xa0 And I want the state to open.\\xa0 But I wasn’t happy with Brian Kemp.\\xa0 I will tell you that right now.\\n\\nYeah, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, are you surprised he defied you on that?\\xa0 Because you made it clear —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, he didn’t.\\xa0 No, he didn’t defy me at all.\\xa0 That’s your language.\\xa0 He didn’t defy me.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, I mean, he’s not —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You know what happened?\\xa0 I said, “You make your own decision.”\\xa0 I told him that.\\xa0 I said, “You’re not in the guidelines, but I’m letting you make your own decision.\\xa0 But I want people to be safe, and I want the people in Georgia to be safe, and I don’t want this thing to flare up because you’re deciding to do something that is not in the guidelines.”\\n\\nAnd I went to Deborah and Dr. Fauci and other people, and they weren’t thrilled about it.\\xa0 And I could have stopped him, but I decided — and we all agreed — they got to watch it closely.\\xa0 So we’ll see what happens.\\n\\nI told him very distinctly — I said — Mike was there — I said, “You do what you think is best.”\\xa0 But if you ask me, am I happy about it?\\xa0 I’m not happy about it, and I’m not happy about Brian Kemp.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A question for Dr. Birx, if I may, Mr. President, about the rate and the decline of the curve in the U.S.\\xa0 You and the Vice President tonight talking about meaningful progress, promising progress.\\xa0 Could you speak to the rate of decline of cases of in the U.S.?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 If we do it quickly, that would be great.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And just — if you’re satisfied with —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Because you see it in the charts.\\xa0 I mean, you have to ask the question, but you do see it in the charts.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And if you have information from other countries that would inform us about the decline.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yeah, so, many of you — and I’ve spoken to all of you from this podium about there’s weekends’ difference in reporting, often a spike on Monday.\\xa0 If you look at Mondays over Mondays, if you look at seven-day reporting, we are starting to go down.\\xa0 We have a long — we had a long, flat peak, largely driven, of course, by New York, which is about 45 or so percent of the cases.\\xa0 As New York goes down, so will the rest of the country have a decline, even more accelerated.\\n\\nI want to say, though, we have had outbreaks.\\xa0 We’ve had outbreaks in specific prisons.\\xa0 We’ve had outbreaks in specific nursing homes.\\xa0 We’ve had outbreaks in specific plants.\\xa0 And when that happens, that adds two, three hundred, four hundred cases on that single date.\\n\\nSo we track, very carefully, not only what the country is doing, but what each state is doing, each county is doing.\\xa0 And we look at delta changes across all of the counties so that we find early warning signals for these types of outbreaks, because we want to — we want the whole country to go down, but we also want to prevent the outbreaks before they occur.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Looking forward to November, to the election, given the risk that the flu and the coronavirus are coming back —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, that’s a — that’s a problem.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah — there could be a problem.\\xa0 Do you think there is a risk that there’ll be — there will be some — there will be lack of agreement, lack of legitimacy to the results in a very close election, and people start saying, “Well, a whole bunch of people couldn’t go and vote because they were scared”?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Look, I can’t tell you what’s going to happen in an election.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is there a risk for legitimate elections?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Great question.\\xa0 I can’t tell you what’s going to happen.\\xa0 We have a sleepy guy in a basement of a house that the press is giving a free pass to who doesn’t want to do debates because of COVID.\\xa0 And lots of things are happening.\\xa0 Right?\\n\\nAnd I watched a couple of interviews, and I say, “Oh, I look forward to this.”\\xa0 But they’re keeping him sheltered because of the coronavirus.\\xa0 And he’s not moving around; he’s not moving too much.\\xa0 And then I watch what the press does to the Republican Party — and to me, in particular.\\n\\nWe had the greatest economy ever put together.\\xa0 We were doing — this is a month and a half ago.\\xa0 We were doing numbers, the like — the likes of which we’ve never done.\\xa0 African American, Asian American, Hispanic American — best employment numbers ever in the history of our country.\\xa0 Our employment numbers, the best in the history of our country: almost 160 million people.\\xa0 The stock market: record numbers, many, many times during my tenure.\\xa0 Many, many times.\\n\\nBut now we have a country that we had to close because of this.\\xa0 And, frankly, if we didn’t close it, we would have lost millions of people possibly, but certainly we would have lost a million people.\\xa0 You take the high number and cut it in half, cut it in half again.\\xa0 But whether it would have been 600, 700, 800, you take a look at the travesty that there is.\\xa0 You take a look at this horrible, horrible scene of hospitals with bodies in black body bags, right?\\xa0 Multiply that times 10, 15, or even 20, because that would have happened.\\n\\nSo we did the right thing.\\xa0 So far, we did the right thing.\\xa0 So far, we’ve called it right.\\xa0 We’ve mobilized like it was a military operation.\\xa0 And it was largely a militarily operation, between ventilators and testing and so many other things.\\xa0 And we’ve had a lot of good partners.\\xa0 Not all good partners, but we had a lot of good partners.\\n\\nGavin Newsom today thanked us very much.\\xa0 Gavin Newsom — California — thanked us so much for getting him all the things that he needed so he can keep going and keep doing a good job.\\xa0 We got it to him today.\\xa0 Tomorrow, we’re getting him even more.\\xa0 It would’ve been harder for him to get it than us.\\xa0 We agreed to get it.\\xa0 We got it on time.\\xa0 He said, “Promises made, promises kept.”\\xa0 He actually said that in a statement today.\\n\\nWe’ve done a good job.\\xa0 We’ve gotten very little credit for the great job we’ve done because of the media.\\xa0 Because the media is not an honest media, in my opinion.\\xa0 Much of it, not all of it.\\xa0 We have some great reporters that I have tremendous respect, but much of the media is not honest.\\n\\nSo I can’t tell you about the election.\\xa0 You have a Democrat Party and you have a large portion of the media automatically giving the guy a pass.\\xa0 He’s been given a pass.\\xa0 Whether or not he’s going to be the nominee, I have no idea, but he’s getting a pass.\\n\\nAnd the media isn’t covering the great job that we’ve done, whether it’s Mike’s task force, which has been incredible; whether it’s the way we mobilized in a war-like operation to build these incredibly complex and very expensive ventilators.\\xa0 They’re very expensive to build and very complex.\\xa0 The job we’ve done has been an amazing job.\\xa0 And I’m not talking about me; I’m talking about everybody.\\xa0 I’m talking about the generals, the admirals, Deborah and Tony, and\\xa0— and now Bill.\\xa0 I mean, something we hadn’t heard today.\\n\\nSo I can’t tell you what’s going to happen with the election.\\xa0 I think that had we not gone through a fake Russia, Russia, Russia deal; an impeachment hoax — it was a total hoax.\\xa0 From the day I got elected — but, you know, it wasn’t the day; it was many months before I got elected — this has been a witch hunt that was illegal.\\xa0 It was an illegal witch hunt.\\xa0 It was illegal.\\n\\nAnd with all of that, I’m doing fine, because the people see we’re doing a great job.\\xa0 And you know what?\\xa0 We’ll continue to do a great job.\\n\\nIf we had an honest press, this country would be even greater.\\n\\nThank you.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\n\\nEND\\n\\n6:52 P.M.

       "  'text': '6:10 P.M. EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Appreciate it.\\xa0 A lot of tremendous things are happening.\\xa0 The number of new positive cases continue to decline nationwide.\\xa0 Recent hotspots appear to be stabilizing.\\xa0 The hotspots are, in some cases, very interesting what’s going on.\\xa0 And they’re going down; they’re going in the right direction.\\xa0 Cases in the Boston area are now declining.\\xa0 The Chicago curve appears to have flattened, which is terrific.\\xa0 And Detroit is past its peak.\\n\\nThese trends demonstrate that our aggressive strategy to battle the virus is working and that more states will soon be in a position to gradually and safely reopen.\\xa0 It’s very exciting.\\xa0 It was very exciting, even today, watching and seeing what’s happening.\\xa0 And people are getting ready and they’re all excited.\\n\\nI do want to mention a man who’s done a very good job for us: Dr. Robert Redfield.\\xa0 He was totally misquoted in the media on a statement about the fall season and the virus.\\xa0 Totally misquoted.\\xa0 I spoke to him.\\xa0 He said it was ridiculous.\\xa0 He was talking about the flu and corona coming together at the same time.\\xa0 And corona could be just some little flare-ups that we’ll take care of.\\xa0 We’re going to knock it out.\\xa0 We’ll knock it out fast.\\xa0 But that’s what he was referring to: coming together at the same time.\\n\\nAnd I think rather than waiting, I’d ask Dr. Redfield to come up, say a couple of words just to straighten that out, because he didn’t say it was a big — a big explosion.\\xa0 The headline in the Washington Post was totally inaccurate.\\xa0 The statement wasn’t bad in the Post, but the headline was ridiculous, which is — as I say, that’s fake news.\\xa0 And CNN is fake news like crazy, and they had just totally the wrong story, which they knew.\\xa0 They were asked to change it, and they wouldn’t do that.\\xa0 And it was false.\\n\\nSo I’ll ask Dr. Redfield, who is, you know, a real professional, to come up and explain.\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 Thank you, Doctor.\\n\\nDR. REDFIELD:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 I really do think it’s important to clarify this as we build the confidence of the American people.\\n\\nWhen I commented yesterday that there was a possibility of the fall, winter — next fall and winter, it could be more difficult, more complicated when we had two respiratory illnesses circulating at the same time: influenza and the coronavirus-19.\\n\\nBut I think it’s really important to emphasize what I didn’t say.\\xa0 I didn’t say that this was going to be worse.\\xa0 I said it was going to be more complic- — or more difficult and potentially complicated because we’ll have flu and coronavirus circulating at the same time.\\n\\nI want to emphasize that we continue to build the nation’s public health infrastructure to ensure that we have the capacity to sustain the containment mode.\\xa0 Those of you who heard me talk before, I’ve told you that in January and February — up to February 27, 28, this nation had 14 cases.\\xa0 We were in the containment mode.\\xa0 And then, unfortunately, the virus overwhelmed where we got into this extreme mitigation.\\n\\nWe are building that public health capacity now to make sure that we stay in the containment mode for the upcoming fall and winter season so we will not need to resort to the kind of mitigation that we had to this spring.\\n\\nI have confidence that our public health response of early case recognition that we’ve talked about, isolation, and contact tracing, combined with our plans for increased surveillance, particularly for the most vulnerable, will be an effective public health strategy so our nation will be able to maintain itself in the containment mode.\\n\\nAgain, that will be supported by the American public’s continued cooperation, obviously in the areas of personal hygiene and the types of social distancing strategies that may be appropriate.\\n\\nThe key to my comments and the reason that I really wanted to stress them was to appeal to the American public to embrace the flu vaccine with confidence.\\xa0 One of the greatest tools we have as we go through the fall-winter season that we’re into is to get the American public to embrace the influenza vaccine and thereby minimize the impact of flu to be the co-respiratory disease that we confront.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Could I just ask a follow-up on that, Dr. Redfield?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, just to clarify your comments —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But I don’t know what’s to follow up.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He was misquoted.\\xa0 Totally misquoted.\\xa0 He said they could come together.\\xa0 They didn’t talk about that.\\xa0 And his whole purpose in making the statement was to get a flu shot, so that next fall we don’t have such a big season of flu — and we possibly won’t.\\n\\nBut, as you said, there’s — it’s possible, if the corona even comes back — and he doesn’t know that it’s going to and neither do I.\\xa0 We spoke a great length.\\xa0 And I think the doctor will speak, if you’d like to continue.\\xa0 But we may have some embers — and we’re going to put them out — of corona.\\xa0 But we may have a big flu season.\\xa0 But that’s different.\\xa0 Flu is very different from corona.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I just ask him a follow-up question?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, go ahead.\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 So, Dr. Redfield, the Washington Post — which, you did the interview with them — they quoted you as saying, “There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be much — even more difficult than the one we just went through.\\xa0 And when I’ve said this to others, they’ve kind of put their head back, they don’t understand what I mean.\\xa0 We’re going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time.”\\xa0 Is that what you said to the Washington Post?\\n\\nDR. REDFIELD:\\xa0 Yeah, that’s what I was trying to say to you just a minute ago — that the issue that I was talking about, about being more difficult, is that we’re going to have two viruses circulating the same time.\\n\\nThis spring that we just went through — February — we had a benefit of having the flu season ended, so we could use all our flu surveillance systems to say, “Whoops, this is coronavirus.\\xa0 We need to focus.”\\xa0 Next fall and winter, we’re going to have two viruses circulating, and we’re going to have to distinguish between which is flu and which is the coronavirus.\\n\\nAnd so the comment that I made: It’s more difficult.\\xa0 It doesn’t mean it’s going to be more impossible.\\xa0 It doesn’t mean it’s going to be more, as some people have said, “worse.”\\xa0 It just means it’s going to be difficult because we have to distinguish between the two.\\n\\nAnd what I was wanting to do and what I want to do again here is appeal to the American public to recognize they can really help, like they did with mitigation, which they really helped.\\xa0 I need them to help now to best prepare us by getting the flu vaccine and taking flu out of the picture.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But that quote — but that quote —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And you may not even have corona coming back, just so you understand.\\n\\nDoctor, would you like to explain that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No, but — but, I’m sorry, but that quote that I just read was accurate — right, sir?\\xa0 Because that’s the quote from the Washington Post.\\xa0 You were accurately quoted, correct?\\n\\nDR. REDFIELD:\\xa0 I’m accurately quoted in the Washington Post as “difficult.”\\xa0 But the headline was inappropriate.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 What does the headline say?\\xa0 What does the headline say?\\xa0 Go ahead, read the headline.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The headline says, “CDC Director Warns Second Wave of Coronavirus is Likely to be Even More Devastating.”\\xa0 And isn’t that correct?\\xa0 Because —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s not what he says.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s not what he said.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s not what he said.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But if you have the two things happening —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The headline doesn’t correspond to the story.\\n\\nDR. REDFIELD:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 I actually think it’s actually going to be — I think the American public is going to heed the request to relook at their vaccine hesitancy, to vaccine with confidence for flu.\\xa0 And I’m confident that the public health infrastructure that we’re putting together now across this country so that we can early-case diagnose, isolate, and contact trace — as I say, block and tackle, block and tackle — that system is going to be there, and we’re going to be able to contain this virus.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Why did you retweet the article if it was inaccurate?\\xa0 Doctor, why did you retweet it?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You weren’t called.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So, I just — we talked about this yesterday when you asked me this question.\\xa0 And someone, I think, used the word “devastating.”\\xa0 And I want to really, again, emphasize to the American public that when we first interacted with this virus for the first time in the February and March timeframe, we didn’t have an understanding of its transmissibility, all of its symptoms.\\xa0 We do now.\\n\\nAnd I think what we are building together, and the — when we talk about the public health infrastructure, it is very much working on the surveillance piece.\\xa0 But I think we also know the strength of the American people and their ability to immediately understand how to protect themselves with not touching their face, making sure that they’re washing their hands.\\n\\nBut the other piece I wanted just to talk about, and we mentioned yesterday also: that we have the summer — while we have flu surveillance that we can utilize and syndromic management that we can utilize — we have all of that time to prepare clearly the testing algorithm that you would need in a flu, potentially, if COVID came back.\\xa0 Potentially.\\n\\nAnd so we are preparing for that potential right now.\\xa0 And I think we spoke to you all about that and talked about how we’re not only preparing for today and tomorrow, but we’re preparing for six months from now, three months from now, and making sure that all of these pieces are in place.\\n\\nI think what Dr. Redfield clearly was asking for — just like we asked for every American to follow the guidelines, he’s saying: Please add to that guidelines getting your flu shot and making sure you’re protected.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And, Doctor, wouldn’t you say there’s a good chance that COVID will not come back?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 We don’t know —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And if it does comes back, it’s in a very small, confined area that we put out.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Well, the great thing is we’ll be able to find it earlier this time.\\xa0 And I think that’s what we’re talking about.\\xa0 We’ll find those cases earlier.\\xa0 So what Dr. Redfield said: We would be able to stay in containment phase.\\n\\nAnd what we’re also hoping — and we talked about this about four or five weeks ago — that we’re hoping that the flu infections also go down because people are much more aware of respiratory illnesses and how to protect themselves.\\xa0 We want you to get your vaccine, but we also want to also protect individuals from getting the flu because of the vulnerability, we know, in certain populations to flu and the devastating outcomes to flu.\\xa0 We could prevent and decrease both of those things.\\n\\nSo I think we are assured that the CDC is putting in place today what we are going to need in the fall so that we can stay in containment if, potentially, the virus comes back.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And if it comes back, though, it won’t be coming back in the form that it was.\\xa0 It will be coming back in smaller doses that we can contain.\\xa0 But what the doctor was saying — and I spoke to him a great length — he was saying, if it should come back “together.”\\xa0 Now you have a flu and you have the embers of corona.\\n\\nBut, in my opinion, from everything I’ve seen, it can never be like anything that we’ve witnessed right now.\\xa0 Would you say that’s a correct statement?\\n\\nDR. REDFIELD:\\xa0 Absolutely.\\xa0 I think —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s nothing like what we’re talking — what we’ve just gone though, we will not go through.\\xa0 You could have some embers of corona, and you could have a big flu system.\\xa0 And if they combine, if they come together — if they come together, it’s not great.\\xa0 But we will not go through what we went through for the last two months.\\n\\nYeah, Jeff.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Is that a correct statement?\\n\\nDR. REDFIELD:\\xa0 Correct.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I understand that the United States will certainly be more prepared in the fall, but how can you say that you know it won’t come back in the same level that it has today?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 What — it is estimated it might not come back at all, Jeff.\\xa0 It may not come back at all.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But how — how can you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He’s talking about a worst-case scenario where you have a big flu and you have some corona.\\xa0 And if it does come back, it’s not going to come back — and I’ve spoken to 10 different people — it’s not going to be like it was.\\n\\nAlso, we have much better containment now.\\xa0 Before, nobody knew about it.\\xa0 Nobody knew anything about it.\\xa0 We understand it.\\xa0 Now, if we have pockets — a little pocket here or there — we’re going to have to put out.\\xa0 It goes out and it’s going to go out fast.\\xa0 We’re going to be watching for it.\\n\\nBut it’s all possible.\\xa0 It’s also possible it doesn’t come back at all.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I understand the containment, but I don’t understand how you know it won’t come back on a big scale.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I didn’t say it’s not.\\xa0 I said if it does, it’s not going to come back on anything near what we went through.\\xa0 But you could have a mess, where they come at the same time.\\xa0 And if they come at the same time — the flu is not the greatest thing in the world, Jeff.\\xa0 It’s not the greatest thing either.\\xa0 If they come at the same time, you have them both.\\n\\nBut if we have embers of corona coupled with the flu, that’s not going to be pleasant, but it’s not going to be what we’ve gone through in any way, shape, or form.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If you don’t think that it’s going to come back at the same severity it is right now, why are you still directing that taxpayer dollars be spent on emergency procurement of ventilators?\\xa0 Tens of thousands of —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Because we have to have them for other reasons.\\xa0 Something else could come.\\xa0 I mean, we didn’t know about corona; now we know about corona.\\xa0 But look at what happened.\\xa0 And now, we did have the H1N1 swine flu.\\xa0 We had that.\\xa0 We have other things that have happened.\\xa0 We had various forms of flu, but nothing like what we’ve had here.\\xa0 Nothing at all like what we’ve had here with the virus.\\xa0 But something could happen.\\n\\nI think that the stockpiles — we’re making hundreds of thousands of ventilators right now.\\xa0 Nobody writes about that.\\xa0 You know, at the one time, all they talked about was ventilators, right?\\xa0 Because you didn’t think it was possible for me to solve that problem.\\xa0 And I solved it and nobody can believe it.\\n\\nI just spoke to world leaders today who desperately need ventilators.\\xa0 They said, “The job you’ve done…”\\xa0 And we’re sending 500 to Mexico, then another 500 to France.\\xa0 We’re sending some to Spain.\\xa0 We’re sending some to Italy.\\xa0 We have them — they’re being made by the thousands.\\n\\nAnd world leaders — I spoke to Prime Minister — I mean, I went through a lot of different calls today.\\xa0 I won’t even tell you.\\xa0 But I went through — I can give you a list if you want — but I went through a lot of calls to a lot of leaders.\\xa0 Spoke with Pakistan; they would like to have some ventilators.\\xa0 We’re going to get them some ventilators.\\xa0 But they all said to me one thing: It was incredible that you solved the ventilator problem because that was a big problem.\\n\\nThe testing problem.\\xa0 We’ve done more than any other nation in the world.\\xa0 Go a step further: If you added up the testing of every nation in the world, put them together, we’ve done substantially more than that.\\xa0 You people aren’t satisfied.\\n\\nSo let’s say we had 350 million people in the United States, right?\\xa0 Let’s say.\\xa0 And if we gave every one of those people a test 10 times — so we give 350 people a test 10 times — the fake news media would say, “Where’s the 11th time?\\xa0 He didn’t do his job.\\xa0 Trump didn’t do his job.”\\xa0 Because you have a lot of bad reporting out there.\\xa0 It’s very sad.\\xa0 And it’s so bad —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But that’s not true.\\xa0 That’s not true.\\xa0 That wouldn’t be the case —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But you’re one of — you’re one of the leaders of the bad reporting.\\xa0 You know?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No, but that’s not true.\\xa0 I mean, this is —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, let’s get onto another subject.\\xa0 I wanted that to be —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, can I just\\xa0 follow up on this real quick?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I wanted that to be cleared up.\\xa0 If you want, we can get on to it later, but I want the Vice President to speak.\\xa0 But you ought to get the news accurately.\\xa0 You ought to write it — if you — if you take a look at what you wrote about the ventilators — and when we became the king of ventilators — we’re making different factories all over.\\xa0 Ventilators by the thousands.\\n\\nIn fact, Mike got back from Wisconsin.\\xa0 The first thing he did, he called up.\\xa0 I said, “How’s it going?”\\xa0 He said, “You’re not going to believe.”\\xa0 He just saw a plant, a factory where they’re making ventilators.\\xa0 I think I can say, the words were “unbelievable.”\\xa0 He said it was unbelievable what he saw — the quality of the equipment, the professionalism.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They doubled production.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 A tremendous number of — how many workers would you say were there?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It was over 550.\\xa0 They doubled production and are about to triple production.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Nobody thought this could be done.\\xa0 The fake news was very unhappy that it was done.\\xa0 But you guys don’t ask me about ventilators anymore.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, who’s unhappy — who’s unhappy that ventilators are being made, Mr. President?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Everybody.\\xa0 Everybody.\\xa0 Because you never mention it.\\xa0 You never mention it.\\xa0 There’s no story that’s what a great job we’ve done with ventilators.\\n\\nWe’re now supplying ventilators all over the world.\\xa0 Because no other country could have done what we did.\\xa0 And you should say that’s a great story.\\xa0 Instead you say, “Trump was slow” or — slow?\\xa0 We were so fast.\\n\\nPlus, we put the ban on so much earlier.\\xa0 When Nancy Pelosi, as an example — you don’t say this — when she’s having her rally in San Francisco — in Chinatown, in San Francisco.\\xa0 Nobody wants to say that.\\xa0 If we didn’t — and Dr. Fauci said this — if we didn’t close our country to China, we would have been so infected, like nobody’s ever seen.\\n\\nWhen you saw the chart — and we were at the top of the list, in terms of success — nobody wrote it.\\xa0 I said,\\n“Where — is anybody going to use that chart?”\\xa0 Nobody wrote it.\\xa0 In terms of mortality.\\xa0 You saw that.\\xa0 Nobody wrote it.\\xa0 Germany and our country: the most successful, in terms of mortality.\\xa0 Nobody wrote it.\\n\\nIt would be great if you wrote the truth, but let’s get on with it because I want Mike to speak.\\xa0 And then we’ll take some more questions, on the assumption you’d like to and I think you probably will.\\n\\nIt’s been encouraging to watch states begin to open up as — and it really has been; it’s a beautiful thing to see — as restrictions are lifted.\\xa0 We must maintain vigilance and continue practicing social distancing.\\xa0 I encourage governors to follow a careful, phased approach.\\xa0 And I want to remind all Americans to adhere to our guidelines.\\xa0 Very important.\\xa0 The governors are going to adhere, hopefully, or they’re going to do what they think is best.\\xa0 I want them to do what they think is best, but ideally they’ll adhere.\\n\\nWash your hands, avoid close physical contact as much as possible, and wear a face covering when distancing is impractical.\\xa0 There were cases.\\n\\nWe’ve flattened the curve and really made tremendous progress, but we must guard against a dangerous rebound.\\xa0 We don’t want to rebound.\\xa0 That’s so important.\\xa0 This is what we were just talking about.\\xa0 We don’t want a rebound.\\xa0 The doctor doesn’t want to rebound.\\xa0 These people definitely don’t want to rebound.\\xa0 I don’t think you want one, do you, huh?\\xa0 You especially.\\n\\nWe don’t want to rebounds after all this death — death — that we’ve suffered.\\xa0 Not work — I don’t view it “work”; I view it “death” that was unnecessary.\\xa0 It should have never happened.\\xa0 It should have never left that little area where it started.\\xa0 You know it and I know it and they know it.\\n\\nIn our all-out war against the virus, we continue to make great strides on testing.\\xa0 Famous testing.\\xa0 Doing more than anybody else anywhere in the world.\\xa0 Nothing funny about that, Jon.\\n\\nMost of the governors have never faced a situation like this before, but we’re helping them find unused testing capacity within their states — tremendous testing capacity that the governors, in many cases, didn’t know they had.\\xa0 And additional capabilities are coming on line every day.\\xa0 We’re coming up with new equipment, like the Abbott Laboratories equipment — on site, five minutes.\\xa0 Great success.\\xa0 Everybody wants it.\\xa0 But you can only make so many of those machines, so we have many other forms of testing.\\xa0 We have many other machines that do it very quickly and by the millions — by the millions.\\n\\nOur task force issued its reopening guidelines earlier than April 30th to give governors the time that they needed to develop testing capability and capacity and customized plans for their states, which many of them did.\\xa0 We’ve had some governors do a fantastic job on testing and on a lot of other things.\\n\\nI spoke — as you know, Governor Cuomo was here.\\xa0 He had a — we had a great conversation on testing yesterday, and they’re doing a really good job in New York.\\n\\nWe’re working very closely with each of the states to help them succeed.\\xa0 I spoke earlier today with Governor Newsom, California.\\xa0 And that was all about testing, that conversation.\\xa0 He has been scaling up really well.\\xa0 Really good job.\\xa0 And I agreed to help him get some of the critical supplies that California needs to make use of the tremendous capacity that they’ve found.\\xa0 This is a tremendous testing capacity.\\xa0 And I’m going to do it very quickly.\\xa0 He needs certain things.\\xa0 I’m going to — we’re going to get that to him very quickly.\\n\\nNow, could he get it himself?\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 But I can get it faster.\\xa0 He understands that.\\xa0 And he’s done a great job.\\xa0 And we’re going to have it to him — we’re going to have a lot of it to him over the next two days.\\xa0 And we’re going to beef it up the following week, get him a lot of additional.\\xa0 He’s done a really terrific job in California.\\xa0 Some of the governors have done a fantastic job, working with us.\\n\\nI told the governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, that I disagree strongly with his decision to open certain facilities which are in violation of the phase one guidelines for the incredible people of Georgia.\\xa0 They’re incredible people.\\xa0 I love those people.\\xa0 They are — they’re great.\\xa0 They’ve been strong, resolute.\\n\\nBut, at the same time, he must do what he thinks is right.\\xa0 I want him to do what he thinks is right, but I disagree with him on what he’s doing.\\xa0 But I want to let the governors do — now, if I see something totally egregious, totally out of line, I’ll do.\\xa0 But I think spas and beauty salons and tattoo parlors and barbershops in phase one — we’re going to have phase two very soon — is just too soon.\\xa0 I think it’s too soon.\\n\\nAnd I love the people.\\xa0 I love — I love those people that use all of those things: the spas and the beauty parlors and barbershops, tattoo parlors.\\xa0 I love them.\\xa0 But they can wait a little bit longer.\\xa0 Just a little bit.\\xa0 Not — not much.\\xa0 Because safety has to predominate.\\xa0 We have to have that.\\xa0 So I told the governor, very simply, that I disagree with his decision, but he has to do what he thinks is right.\\n\\nI’m excited to announce that, in the coming weeks, the Air Force Thunderbirds — they’re incredible — and the Navy Blue Angels — equally incredible — will be performing air shows over America’s major cities and some of the cities that aren’t major cities.\\xa0 They’re going to be doing a lot of work — a lot of very dangerous flying.\\xa0 It’s dangerous, you know — the odds when you start going at massive speeds and you’re 18 inches away from each other.\\xa0 That’s dangerous work.\\n\\nYour son is a great pilot.\\xa0 And I don’t know if he could be — could he be a — could he be a Thunderbird?\\xa0 I don’t know.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’ll see.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think — I think he probably could, from what I hear.\\xa0 I don’t know if I’d want him to be, because it is — it’s incredible what they’re able to do.\\xa0 And to sacrifice our frontline — what we’re doing is we’re paying tribute to our frontline healthcare workers confronting COVID.\\xa0 And it’s really a signal to all Americans to remain vigilant during the outbreak.\\nThis is a — a tribute to them, to our warriors.\\xa0 Because they are equal warriors to those incredible pilots and all of the fighters that we have for the more traditional fights that we win.\\xa0 And we win.\\xa0 If we want to win, we always win.\\xa0 Sometimes we don’t want to win, so we just go to a standstill.\\xa0 But that’s always — that’s not the way this country works.\\n\\nOperation America Strong was the idea of our great military men and women — the Thunderbirds and the Blue Angels crews who wanted to show support to the American medical workers who, just like military members in a time of war, are fiercely running torward the fight.\\xa0 It’s going to be great.\\xa0 I want to see those shows.\\xa0 I’ve seen them many times and I can’t get enough of them.\\n\\nAnd on July 4th, we’ll be doing what we had at the Mall, as you know.\\xa0 We’re going to be doing it.\\xa0 Last year was a tremendous success and I would imagine we’ll do it — hopefully, I can use the term “forever.”\\xa0 That was a great success as you remember, even though it was pouring.\\xa0 It was raining so hard.\\xa0 It was raining at — that was about as hard as I’ve seen in a while, but it was an amazing success.\\xa0 Didn’t bother the pilots.\\xa0 It didn’t bother the military.\\xa0 It didn’t bother the crews that we had there.\\xa0 So we’re going to be doing that again on July 4th.\\n\\nOur great military is operating at 100 percent during this crisis and thousands of troops are deployed alongside of civilians in the COVID hotspots, as you know.\\xa0 You see them all over.\\xa0 I spoke — when I spoke with Governor Cuomo, and when I spoke to Gavin Newsom, and many of the other governors, they wanted to know if we could have some military help with the medical, and we — we gave it to them.\\xa0 And in every case, they said, “Fantastic.”\\xa0 I mean, just fantastic.\\n\\nIn New York City, Mayor de Blasio called me to say it was inspiring to watch.\\xa0 He was there when the military came in.\\xa0 He said it gave everybody spirit when he saw the professionalism and the spirit that they had.\\xa0 They walked in and they helped a lot of — a lot of people: doctors, nurses, respiratory technicians, and professionals.\\xa0 It was an incredible thing.\\xa0 But they all — everybody that saw them going to work said that was something special.\\n\\nSo we’re going to have some tremendous air shows all throughout our country.\\xa0 And that’s in honor of what we’re all going through together, and the people that are helping us so much, and, unfortunately, the people who have passed away from something that should never have been allowed to happen.\\n\\nFollowing around-the-clock negotiations yesterday, the Senate answered my call to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program so that millions of additional American workers can keep getting a paycheck.\\xa0 We just increased it by $310 billion dollars.\\xa0 I urged the House to pass the bill without delay.\\xa0 In our first round of funding, we’ve provided nearly $350 billion dollars, and it went at record speed to American workers and small businesses.\\xa0 And it’s really been an incredible, incredible success.\\n\\nI want to thank the banks.\\xa0 We have the big banks, the little banks, the commercial banks of all kinds.\\xa0 We had the community banks — who were fantastic, by the way.\\xa0 Community banks.\\n\\nAnd as you know — this was an interesting story in recent days — I’ve called for Harvard — that’s Harvard University, which has a $40 billion endowment fund — to return the money that it was allocated under the CARES\\xa0Act.\\xa0 And I’m pleased to announce that Harvard has announced today that they will not accept the funds, nor will Stanford University or many of the others that were involved both on a university level.\\xa0 Also on company level, some of the companies were bigger than people had represented or bigger than people had thought and strong enough that they didn’t need the money.\\xa0 So there’s a certain amount of money that we are not sending.\\n\\nAs soon as I heard it, I said, “Stop funds.”\\xa0 And for the most part, I guess, they stopped it, Mike, right?\\xa0 They stopped it.\\xa0 But we’re not — they’re not accepting the money, and that’s great.\\xa0 And so I want to thank Harvard, I want to thank Stanford, and I want to thank the other companies in the case.\\xa0 It’s broken differently between colleges and companies, but I want to thank the companies and the other great universities. And there’s some great ones.\\n\\nThe legislation passed by the Senate yesterday also reserves $30 billion in loans for small financial institutions that serve minority and distressed communities.\\xa0 This is very important.\\xa0 We’re determined to protect our African American, Hispanic American, and minority workers who have been hit so hard by this hidden enemy.\\n\\nMy administration is pursuing a comprehensive strategy to address the full spectrum of needs in these communities, supporting both health and economic revitalization.\\xa0 First, my administration is committed to providing the testing that is needed to fight the virus in distressed communities.\\xa0 In the last month alone, we’ve already sent over $1.4 billion to our nation’s 13,000 community healthcare centers — think of that, 13,000 — to increase testing and treatment in the underserved areas.\\n\\nWe’re also expanding access to telehealth.\\xa0 Telehealth has become a big deal.\\xa0 You know, I’ve been reading about it for years, and all of a sudden, because of this, it’s become a big — a big thing.\\xa0 People can’t leave their houses.\\xa0 They didn’t want to leave their houses for various reasons, including they wanted to follow the guidelines.\\n\\nThe legislation passed by the Senate yesterday — and I want to thank everybody.\\xa0 A great, great vote.\\xa0 Great.\\xa0 It’s — as you know, it was a unanimous vote.\\xa0 How often do you see that? But the legislation passed by the Senate yesterday includes an additional $25 billion to further expand testing, and provides even more funding for community health centers and various forms of epidemics and pandemics.\\xa0 And we’ll be working on that because, you know, as per a couple of your statements and questions before, we want to work on that for the future.\\n\\nWe hope this doesn’t happen again for — again, ever.\\xa0 But, you know, last time it was of this magnitude: 1917.\\xa0 That’s a long time ago.\\xa0 So we want to be prepared.\\xa0 And we are prepared.\\n\\nAnd, as I told you, we’re building up hospital — not only our stockpile, which is being up greatly — being built up greatly — but also hospital stockpiles.\\xa0 We’re getting them what they need.\\xa0 We’re working out cost arrangements with them.\\xa0 And we’re getting them a lot of the ventilators, which are the hardest thing for them to get, both from a cost standpoint and a technical standpoint.\\n\\nAt the same time, we’re also supporting the establishment of new testing sites focused on these communities.\\xa0 Forty sites have launched so far, and there are plans to launch dozens more in the next three weeks.\\xa0 We’re — we’re coming up with testing apparatus and testing plans that are incredible when you look at the numbers.\\xa0 And some people are very, very big on testing.\\xa0 I’m big on testing, but some people are much less big than I am, I will tell you, and they’re professionals.\\xa0 But we want to have it so that nobody can talk about, “Gee whiz, I wish we had more testing.”\\n\\nNobody has done it like we’ve done it, and nobody will.\\xa0 And we’re getting very much stronger.\\xa0 We have incredible professionals doing it.\\xa0 So many different tests have now evolved, people are finding it even hard to believe.\\n\\nMy administration is working closely with governors to ensure that they have the testing infrastructure in place to reduce further spread of the virus if they’re so inclined to use the testing apparatus, including strategies for older individuals, low-income Americans, minorities, and Native Americans.\\n\\nAs part of the effort, the White House Task Force, headed up by Mike, who has done incredible — I’ll say it every time.\\xa0 I’ll say it to anybody that wants to listen: Mike Pence has done an incredible job.\\xa0 Really, an incredible job.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Is providing technical assistance to all 50 states through one-on-one phone calls as they develop and implement their plans.\\n\\nIn addition, my administration is committed to restoring black and Hispanic communities to full economic health.\\xa0 They want to be healthy, economically and physically, and that’s what we’re doing.\\n\\nTo that end, today I’m directing the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, led by Secretary Ben Carson, to focus its effort on supporting underserved communities impacted by the coronavirus.\\xa0 And so Ben Carson is working on that with Mike and myself and a lot of other people.\\xa0 I’m going to ask Tim Scott, who was so helpful with the Opportunity Zones.\\xa0 That’s an economic answer to a lot of problems.\\xa0 And Tim Scott was fantastic, and so I’m going to ask him to get involved with you.\\xa0 And I’m sure he’ll be willing to do it from South Carolina.\\n\\nI also asked the council to identify what additional funding will be required from Congress beyond what has already been provided.\\xa0 We’re really building ourself a strong base and we’re building ourself a wall that’s very different from the kind of walls that you’ve been hearing me talking about.\\xa0 But it nevertheless, in many ways, performs the same function.\\xa0 And hopefully it’s going to perform it equally as well.\\n\\nFurthermore, the council will seek input from the private sector and community leaders on how we can best support minority and distressed communities.\\n\\nAs President, I’m absolutely determined to deliver a great future for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed.\\xa0 Before our nation was attacked by this horrible enemy, our African American and Hispanic American citizens were prospering like never before.\\xa0 Best employment numbers ever.\\xa0 Not only African American, Asian American, Hispanic American — every American.\\xa0 We were breaking records at every level.\\xa0 We had almost 160 million people employed.\\xa0 We were never even close to that number.\\xa0 And we’re also breaking them economically — highest stock market numbers, highest numbers of every kind.\\xa0 And I think we’re going to be back there, and I think it’s going to be much sooner rather than later.\\xa0 And I think we’ll surpass those numbers, including our employment numbers.\\n\\nBut I’ll not rest until that prosperity has been fully restored.\\xa0 And, again, I really believe that we’re going to lift those numbers higher than ever before.\\xa0 And it won’t be as long as people might think.\\xa0 A lot of very smart people are looking at that and they’re betting.\\xa0 You just have to look at what’s going on with the stock market.\\n\\nIn order to protect our great American workers, I’ve just signed an executive order temporarily suspending immigration into the United States.\\xa0 This will ensure that unemployed Americans of all backgrounds will be first in line for jobs as our economy reopens.\\xa0 Crucially, it will also preserve our healthcare resources for American patients.\\xa0 We have to take care of our patients, we have to take care of our great American workers, and that’s what we’re doing.\\n\\nSo I’ve just signed it, just before coming into the room. And very important, very important.\\xa0 And as to amending it or extending it, that we can do at the appropriate time.\\xa0 But it’s now signed.\\n\\nEarlier today, the First Lady and I planted a tree on the South Lawn of the White House in recognition of the 50th annual Earth Day. \\xa0I was glad to announce that we will begin to reopen our national parks and public lands.\\xa0 We want Americans to be able to satisfy and be really safe.\\xa0 We want them to satisfy their family that safety is going to happen.\\xa0 And it will happen, and maybe even at a level like never before.\\xa0 We’ve learned so much.\\xa0 But we want them to enjoy these great national treasures as we continue to take reasonable precautions.\\xa0 And hopefully, it’ll be just reasonable.\\n\\nMy administration has directed more than $7 billion in federal funding to support the development of treatments, diagnostics, and therapies.\\xa0 And that’s something, Doctors, I hope you can really work on.\\xa0 It’s something so powerful and so important.\\n\\nThe FDA, the NIH, and industry leaders are establishing master clinical trial protocols to test multiple promising new drugs at the same time.\\xa0 And they’re doing a lot of — we’re doing a lot of testing right now.\\n\\nMore than 1,600 locations across the country have signed up to administer convalescent plasma to patients, infusing them with antibodies of those who have recovered.\\xa0 And when they recover — I said it last time — practically, the first thing they say is, “I want to give my blood so that I can help other people.”\\xa0 They want to give their blood.\\xa0 It’s incredible.\\xa0 They’re laying in bed, they’re still in pretty weakened conditions, and they say, “I want to give my blood.”\\xa0 And that’s happening all the time, isn’t it?\\xa0 If you recovered from the coronavirus, I ask you to consider contacting your local blood or plasma donation center to arrange a donation that could potentially save many lives.\\n\\nWith love for our nation and loyalty for our fellow citizens, we will safeguard our families, care for our neighbors, heal the sick, protect our workers, and build a future for a country that is the greatest country anywhere in the world.\\xa0 And we’re only going to get greater.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\xa0 Mike Pence, please.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today and, despite the fact that there have been more than 843,000 Americans who contracted the coronavirus and we grieve the loss of more than 47,000 of our countrymen, according to Dr. Birx and her team, we continue to see encouraging signs because the American people have been putting into practice the guidance that’s been issued by the President and this task force and they’ve been taking to heart the guidance of state and local officials.\\n\\nAnd, Mr. President, as we learned today, we are continuing to see declines in all the major metro areas around the country that have been most impacted.\\xa0 Numbers remain low and steady on the West Coast — in Washington State and in California.\\xa0 The New York metro area, New Jersey, Connecticut all appear to be past their peak.\\xa0 And as — as our scientists may reflect in a few moments, we also are seeing the positive rate going down, which is actually even as encouraging as the declining cases.\\n\\nThe Detroit metro area appears to be past its peak.\\xa0 The Seattle metro area, as I mentioned, remain stable.\\xa0 The New Orleans metro area is the most stable of all the large metro outbreaks.\\n\\nWe also are continuing to see a stabilization and even declines in — in Houston and Atlanta and Nashville and Baltimore and Indianapolis and elsewhere.\\n\\nThis is a tribute to the American people, to the fact that the American people have taken to heart the guidelines — the social distancing; the personal hygiene; the recommendation that you use the drive-through at a restaurant, rather than going in a restaurant; and avoiding groups of more than 10.\\n\\nOn the President’s behalf, on behalf of our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force, we just want to urge all of the American people to continue onward. \\xa0We all want to reopen America.\\xa0 And we want to reopen our states and our communities as soon as it is safe and responsible to do so.\\n\\nBut I want to say to my countrymen: the fastest way to reopen America is to continue to do what you’ve been doing.\\xa0 That’s the fastest way, as President Trump has said many times, to get our country working again — is to put the coronavirus in the past.\\xa0 And we are on our way to doing just that.\\n\\nYou know, from early on, the President called forth not only the full power of the federal government, but he called forth the full weight of the American economy.\\xa0 And I had the privilege yesterday to travel to Madison, Wisconsin, and see American industry and American workers at their very best.\\xa0 And I want to thank the GE Healthcare team in Wisconsin, as well as the union machinists that I spent time with all day yesterday.\\n\\nIt was extraordinary, Mr. President.\\xa0 And earlier this month, you used the Defense Production Act to ensure that supplies could flow to GE and General Motors and Ford and other companies that — that were prepared to repurpose manufacturing lines and hire new workers to construct ventilators.\\n\\nAnd, at this particular plant, they literally have — the union sat down — the machinists’ union sat down and, in less than one week, negotiated a new contract with GE Healthcare that allowed them to begin to bring in workers from around the country.\\xa0 They doubled — they doubled their — their work line in one week.\\xa0 They’re about to triple it.\\xa0 They’ve been going 24 hours a day, 3 shifts, 7 days a week.\\n\\nAnd the President promised that, by harnessing the power of the American economy, we would have 100,000 ventilators in 100 days.\\xa0 But thanks to the ingenuity and the hardworking Americans that I was with yesterday and other companies, we’re actually going to have 110,000 ventilators in 100 days.\\n\\nThey were all wearing t-shirts, Mr. President — I brought one back for you — that simply read, “Union Machinists Save Lives.”\\xa0 And to that great team of GE Healthcare, I want to just say all of America is proud of you and grateful for you.\\n\\nWe’re also grateful to all of our healthcare workers at every level and all the work that they’re doing.\\xa0 And we’re proud that our National Guard and our American military are at their side.\\xa0 As our task force learned today, more than 31,000 National Guard stood up around the country.\\xa0 And the President, in the last day, extended what’s called Title 32 authorizations for all National Guard personnel through May 31.\\xa0 So we’re going to continue to partner with states, as the National Guard plays a vital role in testing, and in cleaning nursing homes, and in standing up states’ response.\\n\\nMilitary personnel: Mr. President, we have more than 5,500 active duty military personnel, including, as of yesterday, 964 medical professionals in the uniform of the United States, working in 17 hospitals in 7 states around the country.\\n\\nWe’re also very proud of our team at the VA.\\xa0 The VA has — has addressed its capacity issues.\\xa0 It’s not seeing cases among the veterans in its facilities increase, so they’re deploying teams to focus on nursing homes.\\n\\nIn Massachusetts, the VA personnel have disinfected two different nursing homes in New Jersey.\\xa0 They’ve literally taken over two state nursing homes and deployed 90 doctors and nurses.\\xa0 And, in Florida, we’re sending 16 teams to assist in nursing home operations.\\n\\nAs the President also mentioned, in addition to what I saw yesterday in Madison, Wisconsin, we continue to — we continue to build our Strategic National Stockpile.\\xa0 It’s growing, again, with ventilators — nearly 11,000 in supply.\\xa0 Nine hundred and one new ventilators will be added, transitioned in the near term.\\xa0 And every American, I think, can — can be confident that, should the need arise for your family member, facing serious consequences from the coronavirus to need that equipment to help them breathe, that equipment will be there.\\n\\nAs we said yesterday in Wisconsin and you’ve said, Mr.\\xa0 President, I think it should be a great source of comfort to every American that no American who has required a ventilator in the United States has been denied a ventilator.\\xa0 And that’s a testament to our healthcare workers, it’s a testament to every American putting mitigation principles into practice, and it’s a testament to all these great companies.\\n\\nSpeaking of great companies, American businesses are stepping up.\\xa0 It was on April 1st that I traveled to Walmart distribution center and the President reached out to the — to the president and CEO of Walmart to ask Walmart to get in the gowns business.\\xa0 And, Mr. President, I’m glad to report to you that we heard today at the task force that Walmart is producing 8.4 million gowns, and they will be delivered into our commercial supply to healthcare facilities around the country by the end of June.\\n\\nThey’re hardly alone.\\xa0 Honda is producing 500,000 face shields.\\xa0 New Balance is making 100,000 masks a week.\\xa0 In a very real sense, the American people have stepped up to make the sacrifices and endure the hardship that social distancing has required, but American businesses, at every size and every means, have come together to respond to the President’s call.\\n\\nIt really has been a whole-of-America approach.\\xa0 And our message from the President’s White House Coronavirus Task Force is to tell the American people it’s working.\\xa0 We’re getting there.\\xa0 We can see light at the end of the tunnel.\\xa0 We can see the day that we can reopen and put America back to work.\\xa0 But it’s going to take all of us, continuing to make the sacrifices necessary to practice those disciplines, to get us to a place where we can reopen safely and confidently.\\n\\nAnd with that, Mr. President, I’ll call Dr. Fauci up for his reflections and — and we’ll move on.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Great.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 So I’m going to just take off from when I was at this podium a few days ago, to kind of reiterate some of the things that the Vice President said, but to kind of connect the dots from where we were, where we are now, and where I think we’re going to be.\\n\\nSo, you remember a couple of weeks ago, when we talked about the fact that we were going to have a really bad week because the deaths, particularly driven by the situation in New York, were going to get worse and worse.\\xa0 But yet, as that was happening, we were starting to see some turnaround, some flattening, and some coming down.\\xa0 As you’ve heard from Dr. Birx and will likely hear more, that that is continuing.\\n\\nSo what has happened is that the mitigation that we put in with the first 15 days and then the 30-day mitigation program of physical distancing worked.\\xa0 So it got us to where we are today.\\xa0 It is a successful formula.\\xa0 It is the basis for our being able to say that we can now think seriously about reopening America.\\xa0 And for that reason, we put together a carefully thought out and, I believe, well-delineated and described program for Opening Up America Again.\\xa0 And you know what it is; it’s the guidelines that we announced a few days ago.\\xa0 Those very guidelines are based on a version of the successful formula that got us to where we are.\\n\\nSo what I’m trying to say is that the program is not one that is going to be: “Turn the lights on in America.\\xa0 We’re finished.”\\xa0 We’re not.\\xa0 We have to proceed in a very careful, measured way.\\xa0 And if you look at the guidelines, they are careful and they are measured.\\xa0 There are certain checkpoints before you can even think about going into a phase one, and then things relax a little as you go into phase two, and relax a little and you go into phase three.\\n\\nNow, we live in a big country and it’s heterogeneous, and there are different dynamics of outbreaks in different parts of the country.\\xa0 So the speed with which one can go from one to another, at the point at which you can even begin to think about the phase, is going to differ.\\n\\nSo the one thing that I know: The urge we all have to get out there and get it over with — let’s get back to normal — for a lot of good reasons because there’s a lot of suffering, economic and otherwise, in this country because of that.\\n\\nBut again, as I’ve pleaded early on, weeks ago, I plead with the American public, with the governors, with the mayors, for the people with responsibility:\\xa0Although I know one has the need to leapfrog over things, don’t do that.\\xa0 Do it in a measured way.\\xa0 This is a successful formula.\\xa0 The problem is if we don’t do that, there is a likelihood that we’ll have a rebound.\\n\\nAnd the one way not to reopen the economy is to have a rebound that we can’t take care of.\\xa0 So, please, again, let me just close by pleading with the American public in general and those who are responsible leaders to carefully consider how we get back to normal.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Fauci, could you talk a little about your expectations for the fall?\\xa0 We heard from Dr. Redfield and Dr. Birx.\\xa0 What do you see for the fall?\\xa0 Is it going to be embers or possibly no return of the virus at all?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 You know, as I’ve said before here, when you look at an outbreak, it’s two dynamic forces opposing each other.\\xa0 If you leave the virus to its own devices, it will take off if you do nothing to stop it.\\xa0 If you put into place the kinds of things that we talk about, first, containment — and then hopefully you never get to mitigation — but containment is important.\\xa0 Those two forces are going to determine whether you’re going to have a big outbreak.\\n\\nSo, what Dr. Redfield was saying, first of all, is that we will have coronavirus in the fall.\\xa0 I am convinced of that because of the degree of — of transmissibility that it has, the global nature.\\n\\nWhat happens with that will depend on how we’re able to contain it when it occurs.\\xa0 And what we’re saying is that, in the fall, we will be much, much better prepared to do the kind of containment compared to what happened to us this winter.\\n\\nNow, the complicating issue is that, unlike the syndromic and influenza-like observances that we have, that you could pick it up by clinically what’s happening, it’s going to get complicated by influenza season.\\xa0 And I believe that’s what Dr. Redfield was saying, that it is going to be complicated.\\n\\nSo whether or not it’s going to be big or small is going to depend on our response.\\xa0 And — and that’s what I think people sometimes have misunderstanding.\\xa0 Nobody can predict what is going to happen with an outbreak, but you can predict how you’re going to respond to it.\\xa0 And that’s really very important.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you would caution against people thinking that, in the fall, there’s not going to be coronavirus anymore and we won’t have to worry about it?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 No.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Or if it is, it’ll be spotty and it won’t be a big problem we have to worry about?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 There will be coronavirus in the fall.\\xa0 If we do — which we won’t, but let’s take an imaginary period.\\xa0 We say, “Okay, coronavirus, forget about it.\\xa0 We’re not going to do anything about it.”\\xa0 It will take off.\\xa0 That’s what viruses do, but that’s not what’s going to happen.\\xa0 We’re going to respond to it to not allow it to do that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Fauci, what happens when governors like Governor Kemp are not following this careful, measured plan and moving forward even without meeting the gating criteria?\\xa0 What do you do about that?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Well — well, you know, if I were advising the governor, I would tell him that he should be careful.\\xa0 And I would advise him not to just turn the switch on and go.\\xa0 Because there is a danger of a rebound.\\xa0 And I know there’s the desire to move ahead quickly — that’s a natural, human nature desire — but going ahead and leapfrogging into phases where you should not be, I would advise him, as a health official and as a physician, not to do that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Can you please give some details about the executive order?\\xa0 I know that the White House has just released a document.\\xa0 I haven’t had a chance to review it.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we could talk about that later.\\xa0 It’s an executive order on immigration.\\xa0 We want Americans to have the jobs.\\xa0 We want Americans to have the healthcare.\\xa0 We want to take care of our citizens first.\\xa0 We have to.\\xa0 And it’s a very powerful order.\\xa0 It’s for 60 days.\\xa0 At the end of 60 days, or maybe even during 60 days, I’ll extend it or not.\\xa0 And I’ll maybe change it.\\xa0 I might modify it.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible) for immigrants who are already here, Mr. President?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I wanted to ask you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Immigrants who are already here in the country or immigrants abroad who already effectively have a green card, trying to get into the country, and healthcare workers?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re talking about immigrants that are trying to get in, and we’re talking about people and — also, by the way, people that are coming in illegally.\\n\\nNow, as you know, because you’ve seen the numbers, our border — our southern border — is very, very tight.\\xa0 It hasn’t been this tight in years.\\xa0 It’s being helped by 160 — more than that — miles of wall that are going up.\\xa0 I’m trying to get to 450 by the end of the year — 450 miles.\\n\\nAnd we’ll have 530 miles early next year, and that’s really great.\\xa0 It’s fully funded.\\xa0 We have all the funds.\\xa0 And the Army Corps of Engineers is doing a fantastic job.\\xa0 Same people that did Javits Center, as you know.\\xa0 They’re doing a fantastic job.\\xa0 So our — our southern border is very, very tight, for good reason — for very good reason.\\n\\nWe’re also being helped by 27,000 very good soldiers from Mexico, and I want to thank the President of Mexico.\\xa0 He’s been terrific in many ways, including on what we’re doing with COVID. And, as you know, we have a very good trade arrangement with Mexico now, which we didn’t have before.\\xa0 So I want to thank the President of Mexico, in particular for the 27,000 soldiers.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you want to talk about the exemptions for the healthcare workers, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They’re doing — they’re doing a fantastic job.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you want to talk about the exemptions for healthcare workers?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, we want to protect our healthcare workers, and that’s one of the other reasons we’re doing this.\\n\\nYes, Jon.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about Rick Bright.\\xa0 He’s the head of the federal agency in charge of getting a vaccine out to — to Americans once it’s ready.\\xa0 He says he has been pushed out of his job because he raised questions about hydroxychloroquine and some of your directives on that.\\xa0 Was he pushed out of that job?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I — I’ve never heard of him.\\xa0 You just mentioned the name.\\xa0 I never heard of him.\\xa0 When did this happen?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This happened today.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I’ve never heard of him.\\xa0 If the guy says he was pushed out of a job, maybe he was, maybe he wasn’t.\\xa0 I — you’d have to hear the other side.\\xa0 I don’t know who he is.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And on the hydroxychloroquine —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Hold on one second, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I just wanted to — you said by Fourth of July you expect people be on the National Mall and we’ll be having a celebration like we did —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Hope so.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — last year.\\xa0 Given what the doctors are just saying — that, you know, coronavirus is still going to be out there — might not be as bad as it is now, but it’s still going to be circulating — is that — is that going to be safe to have that many people on the Mall for July Fourth?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re going to probably have 25 percent of what we had last year.\\xa0 Last year, as you know, it was maxed out — maxed out.\\xa0 I saw a magnificent picture of Dr. Martin Luther King and I saw a magnificent picture of our event last year, and both of them were maxed out.\\xa0 It was beautiful to see.\\xa0 Beautiful.\\xa0 Very similar.\\n\\nThis year, most likely, we’ll be standing six feet apart.\\xa0 We’ll have to do that in a very, very interesting way.\\xa0 And maybe we’ll even do it greater, so we’ll leave a little extra distance.\\xa0 But if we do that, we’d certainly do that.\\n\\nI — I don’t see, maybe, the purpose if we can’t do that.\\xa0 We have to have people.\\xa0 Thousands — we had tens of thousands — most of you were there — tens of thousands of people last year.\\xa0 It was incredible.\\xa0 And it was, to an extent, an air show of all the different aircraft flying over.\\xa0 We even had Air Force One flying over.\\n\\nSo ideally, it would be wonderful if we could actually have it as it was last year.\\xa0 But — and, eventually, we’ll — we will have that.\\xa0 I think it’s important to know: Eventually, we are going to have that.\\n\\nYour stadiums are going to be the way —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You think by July you’d be able to have —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — they’ve been for the last hundred years.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 By July, you’d be able to have a —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I know.\\xa0 But your stadiums — as an example, sports — are going to be the way they used to be.\\xa0 I mean, I told one of the owners.\\xa0 He said, “Do you think I should take out seats?”\\xa0 I said, “No, you shouldn’t take out seats.”\\xa0 We’re going to have it the way it was.\\xa0 We’re going to be back.\\n\\nThis virus will eventually be gone.\\xa0 And if it should show up in the fall, we’re going to put it out very fast.\\xa0 We have great people.\\xa0 We’re going to put it out very fast, because we’ve learned a lot.\\xa0 We’ve learned a lot about how to deal with this, and we’ll put it out very fast.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Nice — just nice and easy.\\xa0 Just — good.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You talk a lot about testing capacity.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And governors agree that that exists.\\xa0 But it’s very different from testing implementation.\\xa0 And they are still begging for you to use your full authority to help them get reagents and other things.\\xa0 As you would like to say, what do you have to lose by helping them do that —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I am doing that.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We are doing that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and becoming the king of testing?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And — and let me just say, we are the king of testing already.\\xa0 There’s no country in the world that’s done more.\\xa0 Not even — not even close.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, only 1.2 percent of the population has been tested.\\xa0 Is that good enough?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I just said there’s no country in the world that’s done more. \\xa0And we have tests that have already come out that are going to be introduced very shortly that will do it more.\\n\\nMy problem is this: It’s a — it’s very much of media trap.\\xa0 Whether we did 2 percent, 5 percent, 50 percent, or 100 percent, it’ll never be enough, no matter what.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But it’s 1.2 percent.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Now, with the — with the expertise and with what we did — because of our expertise and tremendous talent at manufacturing — what we did with the ventilators, that wasn’t a trap.\\xa0 Because we got them done, shockingly to everybody, because of the incredible talent — like Mike Pence saw yesterday in Wisconsin.\\xa0 But we have numerous of those sites all over the country doing the same thing.\\n\\nSo that when the governors were complaining — some of the governors, I must say.\\xa0 And it was very much along party lines, for the most part, but when they — except for one.\\xa0 When the governors were complaining, we said, “No, no.\\xa0 How many do you need?”\\xa0 “We need 50.”\\xa0 “We need 100.”\\xa0 One governor asked for many, many, many thousands, and it turned out they didn’t need that, and that’s good.\\xa0 We got them and nobody that needed a ventilator — you know this, and we went through this with the governors — that needed a ventilator didn’t get a ventilator.\\xa0 That was an incredible achievement.\\n\\nWith testing, it’s a little different.\\xa0 It’s much easier than ventilators.\\xa0 It’s like 2 percent.\\xa0 But — for instance, the swabs are coming in by the millions.\\xa0 They’re coming in — literally coming in by the millions.\\xa0 Totally ordered.\\xa0 We wanted the highest quality.\\xa0 We could have gotten a much lesser quality.\\xa0 We didn’t want to do that.\\xa0 We got the highest quality.\\n\\nBut, testing — it’s like no matter how well you do, you can always say more.\\xa0 With the ventilators, they either have them or they don’t.\\xa0 In fact, we went to one meeting — “Who wants a ventilator?”\\xa0 One governor — one governor said, “We’d like 25.”\\xa0 “Twenty-five.\\xa0 You got them.\\xa0 Who else?”\\xa0 Nobody spoke up.\\xa0 That was four weeks ago.\\xa0 So that was great.\\n\\nThe problem with the testing is, as I said, if we test — if we tested 350 million people, you’ll say, “Well, we want them to have a second test or a third test or a fourth test.”\\n\\nNot everybody believes as strongly as some people in testing.\\xa0 Some people want to do testing because they think it’s impossible for us to fulfill that goal.\\xa0 That’s easy compared to ventilators, as I’ve said.\\xa0 But we have a tremendous testing capability — better than anybody in the world right now.\\xa0 And every day, it’s growing.\\xa0 And it’s growing very substantial.\\xa0 I mean, these doctors are very talented people.\\xa0 They’ve seen testing all their lives.\\xa0 They’ve never seen anything like we’ve been able to do.\\n\\nSo, we’re going to give everybody what they want with the testing.\\xa0 But again, testing — and I’ve said it from the beginning: The actual test has to be administered locally.\\xa0 You can’t do from Washington or faraway locations — federal testing — nearly as well as you can, where you have a governor, he has mayors, and they have representatives, and — and they know the back of a Walmart — put it in the parking lot in the back of a Walmart or put it in a certain location in different states.\\xa0 They’re doing it beautifully.\\xa0 It’s working beautifully.\\n\\nThe relationship I have with the governors, and Mike has, and we all have with the governors, I would say, other than one or two — but even them, they don’t complain.\\xa0 They’re not complaining.\\xa0 So we’re doing tremendous testing.\\xa0 And ultimately, we’re doing more testing, I think, than probably any of the governors even want.\\n\\nOkay.\\xa0 Please, Jennifer.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Back on the immigration EO — can you say, is it just for green cards — for green card holders or is it —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s green cards for — subject —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is it also for people seeking temporary work visas?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0It’s subject to change.\\xa0 We have some people coming in, for instance, helping the farmers.\\xa0 We want to have the farmers take care — they’ve been coming for years and years, and they’re helping our farmers, and they’ve — they’ve been coming in for years.\\n\\nWe don’t want to do — you know, the border has been turned off a number of times over the years.\\xa0 And you know what happened?\\xa0 Our farmers all went out of business.\\xa0 They were out of business.\\xa0 They couldn’t farm.\\xa0 We’re taking care of our farmers.\\xa0 Nobody ever took care of farmers like I take care of farmers.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Subject to change because some —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Including the $19 billion that we’re dispersing to farmers because of some very good things that happened.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Subject to change because some of your advisors are saying there could be a problem with it, or subject to change because you want to extend it?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no.\\xa0 Just it might be modified.\\xa0 It could be modified next week, in two weeks.\\xa0 It could be modified in two months.\\xa0 No, we may modify it as we go along.\\xa0 But right now, we have a very powerful immigration ban, but it could be modified — meaning made tougher or made less tough.\\xa0 We don’t want to hurt our businesses, and we don’t want to hurt our farmers.\\xa0 Very important.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, can I ask you about your conversation with Governor Kemp?\\xa0 What did he say to you when you said you strongly disagreed with him?\\xa0 And, of course, for gym owners and tattoo parlor artists and barbers in Atlanta — I mean, Georgia, generally — would you advise them to listen to you and not to their governor?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Look, I’d like them to listen to their governors.\\xa0 All of their governors.\\xa0 I have the right to do, if I wanted to clamp it down, but I have respect for our governors.\\xa0 They know what they’re doing, I think.\\xa0 And, as you know, Brian Kemp, governor of Georgia, I worked very hard for his election.\\xa0 He beat their superstar.\\xa0 He beat the superstar of their party. I think you can say, I helped a lot.\\n\\nMichelle Obama, Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey — they all went in.\\xa0 They campaigned for him very, very hard, and he lost. He also was way down in a primary, and he ended up winning a primary after I came out and endorsed him.\\xa0 So, a lot of good things and there’s a lot of good feeling between myself and Brian Kemp.\\xa0 I like him a lot.\\n\\nI happen to disagree with him only on time and timing.\\xa0 I disagree.\\xa0 When you have spas, beauty parlors — and I love these people — I know the people from spas and beauty parlors, tattoo parlors.\\xa0 Bikers for Trump — a lot of tattoos.\\xa0 I love them.\\xa0 I love these people.\\xa0 And barbershops.\\xa0 These are great people.\\xa0 But you know what?\\xa0 Maybe you wait a little bit longer until you get into a phase two.\\n\\nSo do I agree with him?\\xa0 No. But I respect him, and I will let him make his decision.\\xa0 Would I do that?\\xa0 No.\\xa0 I’d keep them a little longer.\\xa0 I want to protect people’s lives.\\xa0 But I’m going to let him make his decision.\\xa0 But I told him: I totally disagree.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 The Vice President, in his remarks, was talking about the federal efforts that have been undertaken as it relates to nursing facilities.\\xa0 And, as you both know, they’ve been just so incredibly hard hit — just tragic — over 10,000 COVID-19 deaths so far.\\xa0 The industry says that they’re struggling as it relates to testing.\\xa0 Can you commit to increasing testing at the nursing facilities across the country?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Well, we’re doing that automatically.\\xa0 I mean, that’s almost common sense.\\xa0 But we’re doing that automat- — I mean, you look at the State of Washington.\\xa0 That was our first glimpse of it.\\xa0 They got hit so horribly in that nursing home.\\xa0 It seems — it seemed like everybody was from a particular nursing home.\\n\\nSo we knew immediately that was going to be a problem.\\xa0 And we’re doing that, 100 percent.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I can speak to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re taking very special care of our nursing homes and our seniors, other than me.\\xa0 Other than me.\\xa0 Nobody wants to take care of me.\\xa0 But other than me, we’re taking care of our seniors.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Another — another —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I can speak to that as well.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, please, Mike.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, it’s just an enormously important question.\\xa0 And we want to thank the American people who have been putting off visits to their grandmothers and grandfathers and moms and dads.\\xa0 It’s tough.\\xa0 I’m going to be in Indiana next week, and I’m not going to go see my mom.\\xa0 She lives in her own home, but people get it that the risk of serious illness for a healthy American of the coronavirus is fairly low.\\xa0 You’ll either have flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all.\\n\\nBut as we’ve said so many times at this podium and the American people get it: A healthy American could inadvertently convey the coronavirus to a senior with an underlying health condition and have the kind of heartbreaking results that we’ve seen in nursing homes around the country.\\n\\nIt’s the reason why, from early on, the President took decisive action to raise the infectious disease standards at every nursing home in America.\\xa0 He deployed all 8,000 of our inspectors at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to dedicate all of their time to ensuring compliance with those new higher standards.\\n\\nAnd we’ve spoken about — about nursing home issues with governors around the country.\\xa0 And frankly, there are governors around the country that have done remarkable work with nursing homes.\\xa0 You mentioned Governor Brian Kemp.\\xa0 He actually used the National Guard.\\xa0 In Georgia, he deployed them to nursing homes to do cleaning and to disinfect areas of those nursing homes.\\xa0 And it’s a tremendous service.\\n\\nBut to your point about testing, if you look carefully at the Guidelines to Open Up America Again, you will see that in phase one, the level of testing that we contemplate is first that we want to be able to test anyone who has the symptoms that may be coronavirus, and be able to test them quickly.\\xa0 Secondly, we want to do the kind of contact tracing — and Dr. Redfield and his team are deploying CDC teams in every state in America — to be able to find out everyone that that person has been in contact with and test them.\\n\\nBut if you look right underneath that, what we’re directing states to do is be prepared to deploy testing resources first and foremost to nursing homes and long-term care facilities so that we can monitor any potential outbreak of the coronavirus among the most vulnerable population.\\n\\nThanks to the leadership of our Surgeon General, as the President announced today, we’re also going to be deploying testing resources to vulnerable communities, to underserved communities.\\xa0 The CDC released new preliminary data on the impact, particularly, on African American communities in this country.\\xa0 And it’s the reason why part of our phase-one recommendation is that we deploy testing resources into those communities that are described by the doctors as socially vulnerable.\\xa0 And, even as we speak, we’ll announce next week that we’re already in the process of deploying testing.\\n\\nAnd so it’s a good opportunity to remind every American to be especially careful around our seniors and to heed the guidance about avoiding visitations to protect the health of those who are most vulnerable.\\xa0 But the American people can be assured that from phase one forward, all the way through phase three and reopening, we’re going to be helping to guide the states to focus on the most vulnerable, beginning with our seniors with serious underlying health conditions.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Vice President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 How about right behind Jennifer?\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’ll get back — we’ll get back to you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Commercial labs say that they need to buy new diagnostic machines to be able to double their testing capacity.\\xa0 Your administration has said that there is enough testing capacity to double overnight.\\xa0 How do you, kind of, square that difference?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Very easy.\\xa0 They can get new machines if they want, but even if they didn’t, we have tremendous testing capability.\\xa0 You take a look at what’s happening in California and New York.\\xa0 Governor Cuomo told us very strongly — he said, “Wow, we have a lot of labs.”\\xa0 You know, that’s a research center of the world.\\xa0 They have tremendous — in California, too.\\xa0 Long conversations.\\xa0 They have tremendous testing capability there too.\\xa0 Now, if they want to increase it, they can increase it, but they have plenty right now.\\n\\nYou saw the maps the other day, when we put up the different sites in various states, and virtually all states are like that.\\n\\nHow about you with the mask?\\xa0 Nice that you wear a mask.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 Mr. President, may I actually follow up on those maps from the other day?\\xa0 On Monday, a reporter for a local television station in Miami sent me a question asking if it was possible to get the information on those maps distributed to the media so that local TV stations and newspapers can check on that information.\\xa0 So if that could that be done —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Who did the maps?\\xa0 Do you — do you want do that?\\xa0 Do you want to say something?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Thank you for talking about testing and testing capacity because we have been talking about that for several weeks, because we could see — and we did a full inventory of every single state and every single laboratory.\\xa0 And I also appreciate you talking about the implementation piece of the testing capacity.\\xa0 And it’s complicated, so we have been — we have a team calling every lab and working through the American Society of Microbiology, as I mentioned before, to really work with every lab director to see what the issues are in each laboratory.\\n\\nAnd I just want to thank Administrator Verma, who really worked on increasing the funding for this test and uniquely doubling the funding for the coronavirus nucleic acid test from $50 to $100 to really address some of the issues about laboratory technicians.\\xa0 Because sometimes we think these tests run themselves; they don’t.\\xa0 They actually need people to help with the machines.\\xa0 So we were talking about purchasing more machines; we actually need to have additional laboratory technicians to really be able to work all of those machines.\\xa0 And so it’s lab by lab, state by state, and that’s the dialogue that’s going on now to unlock the full potential of the United States.\\n\\nMaybe the testing would not be needed at this moment, and maybe it is, but we want it also totally available in the fall if it comes to an issue where we have to distinguish between flu and COVID-19.\\n\\nSo we’re building infrastructure and capacity not only for today, but for tomorrow, and really showing a new way to really deal with pandemics and bring testing to scale.\\xa0 Because the country has never had to do this before.\\xa0 I mean, if you look at some of the other countries, they’re — they’re struggling with some of the issues, from PPE to testing.\\xa0 And so this is a universal issue, but we’re working on it as a collective to really have a very innovative and integrated way to approach testing.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But without building new, they have tremendous capability.\\xa0 And —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 And the maps are — I will ask the companies, because, obviously, it’s proprietary where every single machine is.\\xa0 And, you know, if you have that machine and five others, maybe you don’t want to know — let that person know you have five others.\\xa0 It’s kind of like Coke and Pepsi.\\xa0 So I think we’re working very deliberately to really be able to share those maps.\\n\\nThe governors, I can tell you that they — all of the state and local gover- — state governors and the mayors have those maps and the addresses and the type of machine for every single laboratory in their jurisdiction so know who they’re testing.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And many of the governors were not aware that those laboratories were available.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 One more for Dr. Birx, before you leave, on the — the state of California has now partially broken with CDC restrictions on who will get guidance and who should get testing because they want to test people without any symptoms at all in high-risk environments, like a nursing home.\\xa0 Do you agree with this?\\xa0 Vice President Pence, do you agree with this?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Well, not only do we agree with it; it was in our guidelines.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s in our guidelines.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 That was fundamental to our guidelines, and I think we were the first group that said testing asymptomatics will be key.\\xa0 We’ve always said that we think that’s a significant contribution to infections.\\xa0 And we went to the places where we thought it was most critical to find cases the earliest.\\xa0 And so that is where we have asked states in the guidelines to start with nursing home, indigenous peoples, and people in underserved areas and cities to really ensure that we’re monitoring for any type, because we know the asymptomatic piece may be the tip of the iceberg.\\xa0 In fact, it’d be the iceberg underneath the surface.\\xa0 And so if you’re only seeing cases and maybe this.\\n\\nBut in parallel, we’re working with states and local governments to really define what that population is by doing — in collaboration with states, working with them together, to really reinforce this antibody testing but in a careful way where you do two antibody testing to increase your sensitivity and specificity into the 99-plus percent range, because we think it’s really important that you have a very high-quality test, but a high-quality test that you can really tell someone that they’ve had this before.\\xa0 And so we’re waiting to have those two tests that we can do in series to really assure people.\\n\\nBut that is — that was in the guidelines from the very beginning, and we think it’s fundamental, both for right now and going through the fall, because that will be our early alert if any of the COVID virus reappears.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So how much more testing are we going to need?\\xa0 How much —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Jon, you didn’t know that was in the guidelines?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The CDC criteria says that (inaudible) —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, it’s currently in the CDC guidelines.\\xa0 You’re saying that —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, but it’s right — but it’s right in the guidelines.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Birx —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m surprised at you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — while you’re there, can I just —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0Jerome, would you like to say something on that, please?\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nSURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 And I just want to reiterate to everyone that the task force and the administration have a commitment to protecting vulnerable people, and that includes in the area of testing.\\xa0 We’ve had the opportunity to talk to many different groups, and we hear that testing is absolutely a concern.\\n\\nAnd we’ll be giving you more details in the coming days, but I just want you to know that we’re building on the public-private partnership that the President rolled out with pharmacy and retail companies like CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid, Walmart, and Kroger to accelerate testing for more Americans and more communities across the nation.\\n\\nWe’re going to be increasing access to testing for under-tested, underserved, and minority communities.\\xa0 And we’re working closely with partners and states to establish sites in areas most in need of increased access to testing.\\n\\nWe’re using data — CDC-provided data — to locate sites and counties that are under-tested and socially vulnerable, especially with high populations of black, Hispanic, rural, and Native Americans.\\n\\nWe’re using the CDC’s Vulnerability Index, as you heard about — heard about earlier to select sites.\\xa0 And this measures the resilience of communities when confronted by external stressors along four main themes: socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, minority status, and housing type.\\xa0 Our goal — our goal is to have about two-thirds of these initial sites located in counties with moderate to high social vulnerability and about a quarter of these sites and counties with high social vulnerability.\\n\\nSo again, I want communities that are vulnerable to understand that we are strategically and intentionally making sure we’re deploying testing in those areas so that people can get identified if they have symptoms, can get identified if they are asymptomatic, and that we will be able to deploy resources appropriately.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Jerome.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 And I have to say our Surgeon General is doing a great job.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nSURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Great job.\\xa0 Really good.\\n\\nOAN, in the back, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, thank you.\\xa0 Can we talk about Iran?\\xa0 You put out a message this morning making a rather big announcement for our military when it comes to Iranians’ — Iranian aggression.\\xa0 Are you going to change, formally, rules of engagement for our U.S. military so that they can engage?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 We’re covered — we’re covered 100 percent.\\xa0 We don’t want their gunboats surrounding our boats and traveling around our boats and having a good time.\\xa0 We don’t want them anywhere near our boats.\\xa0 And — so you know the order I gave.\\xa0 I don’t think I have to say it again, but I’ve given that order.\\n\\nUnder the Obama administration, it was taking place all the time.\\xa0 Under my administration, I gave this order early on and nothing happened.\\xa0 They were very nice; they were no problem.\\xa0 But then I noticed yesterday, they did that in a much lighter form, but they did that again.\\xa0 I said, “We’re not going to — we’re not going to stand for it.”\\n\\nSo if they do that, that’s putting our ships at danger and our great crews and sailors at — in danger.\\xa0 I’m not going to let that happen.\\xa0 And we will — they’ll shoot them out of the water.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So the U.S. military does not have to change its rules of engagement in order to follow your directive?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, that’s not rules of engagement; that’s a threat when they get that close to our boat.\\xa0 And they have guns.\\xa0 They have very substantial weapons on those boats.\\xa0 But we’ll shoot them out of the water.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, President Trump.\\xa0 If possible, I’d like to ask a question to Dr. Fauci and then a very different one to you.\\xa0 To Dr. Fauci, today the CDC and the USDA said that the first pets in America had tested positive for coronavirus.\\xa0 What does that mean, and what should the public know about that?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Pets?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Pets.\\xa0 Two pets.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Pets.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 So that question was asked before, but I’d be happy to answer it again.\\xa0 Certainly, animals, pets can get infected.\\xa0 Big cats in zoos have been reported to be infected with coronavirus.\\xa0 There is no evidence that the virus is transmitted from a pet to a human.\\n\\nNow, obviously, is that impossible?\\xa0 I mean, biologically, you know, anything is possible, but there’s no evidence whatsoever that we’ve seen, from an epidemiological standpoint, that pets can be transmitters within the household.\\n\\nSo, it’s not surprising.\\xa0 I mean, we — when you have viruses that can infect multiple species, isolating it from an animal doesn’t necessarily mean the animal is transmitting it.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 What about the lion in the New York Zoo?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah, well, you know, that’s the lion in the New York —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 How did that — how did that happen?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 You know what probably happened?\\xa0 I don’t know, Mr. President, but I would imagine that one of the — one of the zookeepers probably had an asymptomatic infection, took care of the animal, gave him some food, touched him or whatever, and that’s how he got it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A question for you, President Trump.\\xa0 My question for you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — is: Earlier in these briefings, you talked a lot about giving Americans hope and you wanted to focus on that.\\xa0 But now that the crisis seems to perhaps be lessening, I wanted to ask you about accountability.\\xa0 And, of course, million — millions of Americans became familiar with you as the tough boss who fired people for doing a poor job.\\xa0 I wanted to ask you about two specific things.\\xa0 There was a report from Reuters today that the HHS Secretary put a former dog breeder in charge of day-to-day coronavirus efforts, to begin with.\\xa0 And also on —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He did what?\\xa0 What?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Reuters reported today that Alex Azar, the Secretary of HHS, put a former dog breeder — that was his most recently former job — in charge of day-to-day operations of the coronavirus.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That, I don’t know.\\xa0 But I — you’re just telling me something.\\xa0 And what’s the second?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And the second one is on face masks.\\xa0 Taiwan has a bigger population than New York State.\\xa0 Early on, they had universal wearing of face masks.\\xa0 Here —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No problem with face masks, if the governors want to do that.\\xa0 You know, we ordered — I don’t know if you know — 500 million face masks.\\xa0 We have hundreds of millions right now.\\xa0 And if people want to wear them, it’s up to the governors.\\xa0 If the governors want that, it’s absolutely — now, it’s more appropriate in some states, obviously, than others.\\xa0 You have the big plains and you have certain states where it’s much less necessary.\\n\\nBut, no, that’s up to the governors.\\xa0 And we have that very well covered, I think, face masks.\\xa0 But we have —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Here, people aren’t wearing masks.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We have hundreds of millions of face masks, and we have at least 500 million.\\xa0 That’s a lot.\\xa0 We’ll have them very shortly.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And lots of people are wearing face masks now that the federal government advised.\\xa0 It was almost overnight.\\xa0 But less than a month ago, our Surgeon General said that — and I’m quoting — they’re, quote, “not effective in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus.”\\xa0 I mean, is — should there be accountability there and also from HHS Secretary?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0 Well, I don’t know.\\xa0 Would anybody like to speak about it?\\xa0 I don’t — I think, if — for — as — just so you understand, if somebody wants to wear them, I’m all for it.\\xa0 Would somebody like to discuss that?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Bob Redfield.\\xa0 Bob.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Go — go for it, Bob.\\n\\nDR. REDFIELD:\\xa0 I think the comments that we made when we came into face masks — and I think it’s important when we came out with the CDC guidance about face masks, or what we called “face coverings” — was, in recognition of the growing understanding of asymptomatic infection or pre-symptomatic infection, was the recognition that we could use a barrier.\\xa0 And the reason — you know, and I have mine when I’m in public, right here, that I use — you know, that this barrier, in case I was, in fact, infected if I didn’t know, is a barrier to prevent me to protect you in case I happened to be asymptomatically infected.\\n\\nThere’s very good data to show that the ability of viral particles to go through a barrier is substantially dishmininished [sic] — diminished.\\xa0 And that’s why we recommended these face coverings.\\xa0 I think if you go back to when CDC came out with that recommendation, some people may think, intuitively, it’s to protect them from getting infected.\\xa0 No, it was to protect you from potentially getting infected by me when I go out in public.\\n\\nJerome, do you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Jerome, please.\\n\\nSURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:\\xa0 I actually appreciate you asking that question because it’s one that — that we’ve had to clarify several times, and I understand why the American public has been confused over time.\\n\\nAs Dr. Redfield mentioned, initially we said, based on CDC, World Health Organization, and most other major public health organizations that the public needed to know that these masks are not effective or shown to be effective in preventing you, if you wear a mask, from catching coronavirus.\\n\\nAnother important thing to remember is the context of those statements was a run on medical masks, on N95 masks, and our healthcare workers were at risk.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Right.\\n\\nSURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:\\xa0 What’s changed?\\xa0 What’s changed is, we found out that, unlike past viruses that are spread through the respiratory route, a significant proportion of coronavirus cases can be traced back to asymptomatic spread.\\n\\nSo the task force deliberated this.\\xa0 We’ve always told you that we will look at the facts and we will give people recommendations based on the best available evidence at the time.\\xa0 And once we saw that asymptomatic spread, we said, “Well, masks still aren’t effective, from our point of view, at preventing you from catching coronavirus in a significant way.”\\xa0 But we’ve always told people that they should wear masks, if they know they have symptoms, to prevent them from spreading to other people.\\n\\nWell, now that we know about 25 to 50 percent of people are spreading asymptomatically, we suggested people wear cloth facial coverings to prevent asymptomatic spread.\\xa0 You wear your mask to protect me.\\xa0 I wear my mask — and Dr. Redfield mentioned it —\\xa0 I’ve got my mask — I believe I have mine on me, Bob.\\xa0 I carry mine around with me too.\\xa0 I wear my mask to protect you.\\xa0 We’re six feet away, which is why I’m not wearing my mask to protect you now, and we also all have been tested.\\xa0 So that’s why I’m not wearing mine now.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, but I’m right next to you, so.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\n\\nSURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:\\xa0 Well, I’ll put mine on if you want me to, sir.\\xa0 But — but again, important to note that if you’re going to wear a mask, it’s not a substitute for social distancing.\\xa0 Still, social distancing is the number one thing you can do.\\n\\nNumber two, it’s important to know that you should practice good hand hygiene and not touch your face, because you still can touch a surface and bring disease to your face.\\n\\nAnd number three — this is the most important — well, it’s just as important: Please, save the medical masks, the N95s for the healthcare workers, because the cloth facial coverings are effective, as far as we know right now, based on the best available evidence, at preventing you from spreading disease to other people.\\xa0 So no inconsistency there.\\xa0 It’s just the recommendation changed because the information changed, and that’s what you want from your public health leaders.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There’s been the now argument made that you knew about the asymptomatic transmission at the time that you said that and that you were essentially misleading the public?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I think it’s (inaudible).\\n\\nSURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:\\xa0 Well, I made —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He’s answered that question.\\n\\nSURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:\\xa0 The honest answer to you is: No, we did not.\\xa0 That was a recommendation of the World Health Organization and the CDC, and we gave you the best information we could at the time.\\n\\nSo I actually, a little bit, resent that implication because I work hard to try to protect the American people, and we are always going to give the American people the best information we have available at the time.\\xa0 And we don’t — and we have — we’re humble enough to say, “Look, if we don’t know, we’re going to change.\\xa0 We’re going to change our recommendations.”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Just a wise-guy question, that’s all.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about the launch of the military satellite by Iran.\\xa0 I wanted to get your response to that.\\xa0 Do you see this an advancement of the missile program?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You mean the shot they took?\\xa0 Well, they say no.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 They say all sorts.\\xa0 “It was for television”.\\xa0 Does anybody really believe that?\\xa0 They want to have better television in Iran, so they say.\\n\\nNo, we’re watching Iran very closely.\\xa0 Very closely.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you concerned —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We know more about Iran than they do.\\xa0 Right now, we know more than they do.\\xa0 So we know all about it.\\xa0 We watched it; we knew it was going up.\\xa0 We followed it very closely.\\xa0 They say it was for television.\\n\\nYes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you concerned, though, Mr. President?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I have a question for Dr. Fauci.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Finish up there, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, very quickly.\\xa0 Are you concerned that they see this as a potential vulnerability on the part of the United States?\\xa0 There is the outbreak —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 See what?\\xa0 What is vulnerable?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Military readiness.\\xa0 The outbreak on the Roosevelt, the fact that you’re consumed with dealing with coronavirus here in the United States.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Her, I read where various navies have had outbreaks of COVID.\\xa0 Look, we’re in 184 different — different nations right now.\\xa0 A hundred and eight-four — the COVID.\\n\\nNo, we have a problem on — that just shows you how rapidly it spreads.\\xa0 It started off with two sailors and then 10 sailors and 20, and now I hear it’s 540, of which one has died and a few are very sick.\\xa0 But most of them are back in — you know, in great shape.\\xa0 But we did — we did lose one, and it attacked the lungs of that young person.\\xa0 And then we also had a number of that were quite sick, but they’re all either better or getting better.\\xa0 But most of them are better for a long time already.\\n\\nOkay, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, can I —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, just one second.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thanks, Mr. President.\\xa0 As you know, over the course of the past few weeks, there have been the closures of several meat-processing companies across the country in several states.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is this a concern to you?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you going to increase testing in these facilities because the workforce is getting sick?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Look at South Dakota, how well the governor is — yeah, look at South Dakota, how well the governor has done there.\\xa0 And, all of a sudden, you have a big spike in one location.\\xa0 And she’s got that very much under control, as you know.\\xa0 But nevertheless, that was surprising.\\xa0 And they had a big one right near where you were yesterday, as I understand it.\\xa0 And — so yeah, we’re concerned about that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is the food supply —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They’re closing one or two of the plants, actually.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is the food supply secure?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, totally secure.\\xa0 It’s in great shape.\\n\\nYeah, in the back.\\xa0 You didn’t go.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 The Attorney General in the State of Missouri filed a law — a law case against China —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Against China.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — accusing it of lying and covering up about the origin of the virus.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do support that?\\xa0 And do you call for international —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I haven’t seen the case.\\xa0 I know about the case.\\xa0 He filed a case against China.\\xa0 I love Missouri, as you know.\\xa0 It’s great.\\xa0 But I’m going to take a look at it.\\xa0 I actually know about it very much.\\xa0 I have to take a look at it.\\xa0 I have not seen the case, in terms of reading it, but I will be doing that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But would you call for international investigation?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re going to have to take a look.\\xa0 Oh, we’re doing investigations.\\xa0 We’re doing our own.\\xa0 But I do want to see and review that lawsuit.\\xa0 I’m sure that won’t be the last one.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, yes, I just had a follow — a question for Dr. Fauci, if you don’t mind.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And I’m happy to ask you one after.\\xa0 So Jon had asked the President about Rick Bright, and he said he wasn’t sure who that was, but I’m — I’m sure you’re familiar who he is since he was the head of BARDA.\\xa0 So this concern or an accusation he’s raised that he was removed from his job because he protested widespread use of hydroxychloroquine, are you familiar with the situation?\\xa0 And do you feel like public health experts feel they are able to speak publicly or to speak out in opposition to the things?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Here I am.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 So you don’t feel like there’s any concern among —\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 No.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — people at the NIH right now or in the public health community?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 At the NIH, absolutely not.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Fauci, knowing Dr. Bright and knowing what his gifts are as one of the country’s leading experts on vaccines, are those gifts best suited at NIH rather than BARDA?\\xa0 What’s he going to be doing with you?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 What is he going to be doing at the NIH?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, first of all, are his gifts best suited to work with you rather than BARDA?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 No, I — I can’t — I don’t really think I can comment on somebody’s relative gifts.\\xa0 I mean, he’s — he’s going to be at the NIH, and he’s going to be responsible, from what I hear — again, this is what I’ve heard — that he’s going to be responsible for the development of diagnostics, which is very, very important.\\n\\nThe NIH is going to be involved in trying to develop new-generation diagnostics, which we feel is going to be very important for the future of being able to facilitate the kinds of things that now are sometimes problematic.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you concerned at all that he —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And why did you say that he has great gifts or gifts?\\xa0 What, do you know him?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, that’s his expertise.\\xa0 I mean, I’m just looking at his résumé.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no, but have you reviewed him?\\xa0 Have you — have you studied him?\\xa0 Have you reported on him?\\xa0 You said, “his gifts.”\\xa0 His gifts.\\xa0 I mean —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 He’s worked his entire career developing vaccines, including the —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, that doesn’t mean you have gifts.\\xa0 I know a lot of people, they play baseball, but they can’t hit 150 in the Major Leagues.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, he helped develop the flu vaccine last year.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no, but you talk about his great gifts.\\n\\nGo ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, thank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please, go ahead.\\xa0 You can go.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 I have two questions, one for myself and then one for a colleague of ours who cannot be here today because of social distancing.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 From where?\\xa0 From where?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m with USA Today.\\xa0 First, the executive director of the National Association of Counties said today that the White House did not want to see money for local — state and local governments in the latest COVID assistance package.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And they didn’t want to say what?\\xa0 What does that mean?\\xa0 Tell me.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m sorry?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 What does it mean?\\xa0 Repeat it.\\xa0 Say it a little differently.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The executive director of the National Association of Counties said today that the White House objected to putting funding for state and local governments into the latest COVID assistance package.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, really?\\xa0 That’s interest- — is he a Democrat?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I do not know, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, check it.\\xa0 How can you ask that questions without knowing?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Well — but what —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Check it out.\\xa0 You’ll find out.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’ll check it out.\\xa0 But he says —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, what’s the next question?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 His question was —\\n\\nTHE President:\\xa0 You know, the numbers — you know, the money we put into states, local governments, everything else?\\xa0 And they have to be responsible for their own finances.\\xa0 But you check it out.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 What’s the next —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, his point was — he said that you felt like that this would somehow be a disincentive for states to open their economies.\\xa0 Is he correct about that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 How would he know what I felt?\\xa0 I never spoke to him.\\xa0 I don’t even know who he is.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m asking you, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You don’t know who he is either.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, his name is Matthew Chase, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, it doesn’t help me, and it doesn’t help you.\\n\\nOkay, go ahead, Jeff.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, also a follow-up —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Do we want to keep going a little while longer or no?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You’re not going to say, “Oh, he took questions all night long”?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 Right?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, please.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, well, good.\\xa0 How many questions can you ask?\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Also —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We — we all have fun, because we’re talking about something very important.\\n\\nThe main thing is I think we’re getting to a lot of solutions.\\xa0 We never want this to happen again.\\xa0 We never want this to happen again — what happened.\\xa0 And if it should come back in some form, we want to snuff it out very quickly before anything can happen.\\n\\nAnd I personally hope it doesn’t come back in the fall as a combination of the flu or not as a combination of the flu.\\xa0 But I think we learned a lot.\\xa0 And, you know, some of these questions are good.\\xa0 Some of them are ridiculous, frankly, but some of them are very — I think some of them are very important questions.\\xa0 Very important.\\xa0 You know, when you asked Dr. Fauci about the right to speak — if I let him speak, I’ll let anybody speak.\\xa0 And we love him.\\n\\nLet’s go.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, Senator — Senator McConnell said today that he would prefer to see states that have high public pensions declare bankruptcy, rather than taking on more —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I — I heard he said that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — federal bailout money.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know — I don’t know what he said.\\xa0 I’ll have to call him and ask him.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 That’s what he said.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, that’s okay.\\xa0 I’m going to have to look at it directly.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Would you agree with him on that?\\xa0 Or —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I can’t tell you that.\\xa0 I have to see — I want to base it on fact and reason.\\xa0 I want to see what he said — you know, why he said it and how he said it.\\xa0 I’d have to watch him say it.\\xa0 But some of the states are not doing well, let’s face it.\\xa0 And some are doing phenomenally well.\\xa0 A state where Mike was governor, Indiana — I looked at their numbers.\\xa0 They have — it’s incredible what they’re doing.\\n\\nSome states are doing fantastically well. \\xa0Iowa is doing great.\\xa0 You have — you have states doing well, and you have some states that aren’t doing well.\\xa0 We know the ones.\\xa0 I don’t have to mention the ones that aren’t doing well, but you do have states that are in trouble.\\xa0 And certainly they’re coming back to talk to us.\\xa0 We’ll see what happens.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you concerned — are you concerned, sir, about the growing U.S. national debt as a result of these stimulus packages?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we have a choice.\\xa0 Do we have a choice?\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 I’m always concerned about everything.\\xa0 We had to fix this problem.\\xa0 This was — we were attacked.\\xa0 This was an attack.\\xa0 This wasn’t just, “Oh, gee.”\\n\\nAnd this wasn’t the flu, by the way.\\xa0 You know, they like to say the flu.\\xa0 Nobody has ever seen anything like this.\\xa0 1917 was the last time.\\xa0 We were attacked.\\xa0 We had the greatest economy in the history of the world.\\xa0 We had the greatest economy — better than China, better than any place.\\xa0 They will tell you that.\\xa0 I dealt with them for a long time, and they will tell — we have the greatest economy and we built it in the last three years, three and a half years we built it.\\n\\nAnd then one day, they came and they said, “You have to close it.”\\xa0 I said, “You got to be…”\\xa0 “These people right here, they said you have to…”\\xa0 They came into my office — into the Oval Office, and they said, “We have to close the economy.”\\xa0 I said, “Let’s explain this.\\xa0 Explain this to me.”\\xa0 The greatest ever in history and we had to close it.\\n\\nNow we’re going to open it again, and we’re going to be just as strong or stronger.\\xa0 But you have to spend some money to get it back open.\\xa0 We saved our airlines.\\xa0 We just, as you know, finished up with the airlines.\\xa0 We saved numerous companies — that are great companies — that, two months ago, were having the best year they’ve ever had.\\xa0 Now, all of a sudden, they’re totally shut out of markets.\\n\\nThere was a great spirit today.\\xa0 You know, the fact is some of the governors are opening up their states.\\xa0 And I saw it.\\xa0 I feel it.\\xa0 I don’t know if you folks feel it.\\xa0 I feel it.\\xa0 There was a great spirit today.\\xa0 I don’t know, the stock market was up today, I guess.\\xa0 It was up quite a bit when I just walked out here.\\n\\nAnd I will say I feel much different today than I did two or three days ago, and I think the world does.\\xa0 We spoke to a lot of leaders.\\xa0 The world feels that we’re really leading a path of optimism.\\xa0 The European Union is having a lot of difficulty.\\xa0 You know, you take a look at what’s going on with the European Union; it’s having tremendous difficulty.\\n\\nBut we’re going to be back, and we’re going to be back stronger than ever.\\xa0 We’re going to be at a level, I think, that everybody is going to be look — and they do; they look up to us.\\xa0 They want to know what are we doing.\\xa0 What are we doing with therapeutics?\\xa0 What are we doing with vaccines?\\xa0 We’re going to have those answers too.\\xa0 We’re going to have them, just like we took care of ventilators, just like we’re taking care of — and, already, as we said 100 times, we had more testing than any nation in the world.\\xa0 We had more testing than all of those nations put together that we mentioned the other day — all of them put together.\\xa0 And we’re going to be, within two weeks, at a level that nobody has ever even seen before.\\n\\nThey’ve never seen where we are right now.\\xa0 You don’t have to build new machines.\\xa0 You don’t have to build new labs; we already have them.\\xa0 But some of the labs are even upgrading to be able to double and triple their capacity, in one case.\\xa0 No, we’re at a level that nobody has ever been.\\xa0 We’re going to be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before.\\xa0 So I’m not concerned about that.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nEND\\n\\n7:48 P.M.

       "  'text': 'James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\\n\\n5:46 P.M. EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, thank you very much everyone.\\xa0 We had a very big day today.\\xa0 I want to start by saying that our love and prayers of every American continue to be with our fellow citizens who have lost a cherished friend or a family member to the virus.\\n\\nAmidst our grief, we’re making tremendous strides against this invisible enemy.\\xa0 Thanks to our aggressive campaign against the virus and the extraordinary talent of our medical professionals, our mortality rate remains roughly half of that of many other countries and one of the lowest of any country in the world.\\xa0 And that’s due to a lot of — a lot of things, but our medical professionals have been incredible.\\n\\nSince we announced our “Guidelines on Opening Up America,” as we call it — we say “Opening up America,” and we add the word agun [sic].\\xa0 I think we can add the word, probably, “again.”\\xa0 But that’s what it is: We’re opening up America again.\\n\\nTwenty states representing 40 percent of the U.S. population have announced that they are making plans and preparations to safely restart their economies in the very near future.\\xa0 So that’s 20 states; that’s about 40 percent of our country.\\xa0 They’re moving along pretty quickly.\\xa0 Three announced today, as you know, and they’re going to be doing it safely.\\xa0 They’re going to be doing it with tremendous passion.\\xa0 There’s — they want to get back to work.\\xa0 The country wants to get back to work.\\n\\nA short time ago, the Senate passed the Paycheck Protection Program and Healthcare Enhancement Act, with additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, hospitals, and testing.\\xa0 A lot of money for all of them, especially for our workers and our small businesses.\\n\\nMy administration has worked aggressively with Congress to negotiate this critical 482-billion-dollar funding package.\\xa0 We reached a deal that includes $382 billion in crucial small-business support to keep workers on the payroll; $75 billion to aid hospitals, which really need the aid, and very badly — I’m very proud of that; and $25 billion to support coronavirus testing efforts.\\n\\nI urge the House to pass the bill, and they’re going to be voting on it, I imagine, very — very soon.\\n\\nI think while we’re here, and so he’s a very busy man, as you know — Secretary Mnuchin — he’s going to be running back, so I thought we’d do — we’ll talk about that now, and we’ll take a couple of questions on that.\\xa0 And then he can go and start phase four, as the ink is drying.\\n\\nProbably, they’ll be voting tomorrow in the House, but shortly.\\xa0 Shortly.\\xa0 And I think we have tremendous support.\\n\\nSo, Steve, please come up. \\xa0Say a few words.\\xa0 Steve?\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 And thank you for all your work with us to get this passed.\\xa0 I’d especially like to thank Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer and the entire Senate for passing this.\\xa0 I’d also like to thank Kevin McCarthy and Nancy Pelosi, who have been working with us around the clock as well, and our Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, who was also very instrumental in this.\\n\\nLet me just comment.\\xa0 We’ve had tremendous support for the PPP.\\xa0 This gives us another $310 billion for the PPP.\\xa0 We look forward to the House passing this tomorrow and being up and running quickly after that.\\n\\nThis also gives us $50 billion for disaster loans, EIDL loans.\\xa0 That will allow the SBA to make $300 billion of disaster loans, all for small businesses.\\xa0 It also allows us, as the President said, more money to hospitals and an unprecedented amount of money for testing.\\xa0 And again, I think we understand hospitals — not only the hospitals that have been impacted by coronavirus, but more importantly, many hospitals that have been shut down, and making sure that the doctors and nurses get money.\\n\\nNow, let me make just one more comment on the program.\\xa0 We have over a million companies that have received this with less than 10 workers.\\xa0 So there is very broad participation in really small business.\\xa0 I will comment there have been some big businesses that have taken these loans.\\xa0 I was pleased to see that Shake Shack returned the money.\\xa0 We will be putting out some FAQs.\\xa0 There is a certification that people are making.\\n\\nAnd I asked people — just make sure: The intent of this was for business that needed the money.\\xa0 We’ll put out an FAQ.\\xa0 But again, the intent of this money was not for big public companies that have access to capital.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And not for Harvard, you might say, Steve.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, Mr. Secretary, are you going to request that those other companies — because obviously Shake Shack was not alone in being a big company that got money in this.\\xa0 Are you going to be asking —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m going to request.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You’re going to ask them —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m going to request.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — to return that money?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yep.\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Yeah, I would —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Harvard is going to pay back the money.\\xa0 And they shouldn’t be taking it.\\xa0 So, Harvard is going to.\\xa0 You have a number of them.\\xa0 I’m not going to mention any other names.\\xa0 But when I saw Harvard, they have a — one of the largest endowments anywhere in the country, maybe in the world, I guess.\\xa0 And they’re going to pay back that money.\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 And I just — I just want to clarify —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They shouldn’t have taken it.\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 — because certain people on the PPP may have not been clear in understanding the certification, so we will give people the benefit of the doubt.\\xa0 We’re going to put an FAQ out, explain the certification.\\xa0 If you pay back the loan right away, you won’t have liability to the SBA and to Treasury.\\xa0 But there are severe consequences for people who don’t attest properly to this certification.\\n\\nAnd again, we want to make sure this money is available to small businesses that need it, people who have invested their entire life savings.\\xa0 We appreciate what’s going on, and they’re hiring people back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And how are you going to ensure that those small businesses — the small restaurants, cafes, bars — who did not get the money last time around are going to get it this time?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, as I said — you know, there are million — a million of these companies that did get it, that are very small.\\xa0 We’re working with the banks.\\xa0 We’re extremely pleased that the small banks did great.\\xa0 Twenty percent of the loans were made by banks of a billion and less; sixty percent by 20 billion and less.\\xa0 And the big banks also.\\xa0 We want everybody to participate.\\xa0 There’s now a lot of money back in the program, and we look forward to all these small businesses getting access to funds.\\n\\nBret, it’s great to see you here.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\\xa0 Do you know, estimate, how long this is going to take?\\xa0 That other pot of money obviously went quickly.\\xa0 Do you assume this is going to go quickly as well?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, let me just say — I mean, you know, kind of, we’re pleased with the success of this program and how quickly this got up operationally.\\xa0 We’ve — we’ve put out more money in these SBA loans than in the last 10 years of SBA.\\xa0 So I want to thank all the banks that have worked really hard.\\n\\nWe knew that when we passed this originally, if there was full take-out, we wouldn’t have enough money.\\xa0 That’s why we’ve worked with Congress for more money.\\xa0 And this is going to — you know, we’ve already impacted about 30 million workers. There’ll be a lot more.\\xa0 So we look forward to this having a big impact on the economy.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thanks.\\xa0 Yesterday, the President said he’d look into the issue of felons, those with criminal convictions getting access to some of these programs.\\xa0 I was wondering if you have an update on that as part of this —\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 So we worked with the White House on this.\\xa0 There were actually much more onerous restrictions in the SBA program.\\xa0 There were people who had misdemeanors that weren’t allowed to access the program.\\xa0 It was much longer than five years.\\n\\nAnd, you know, we very much — because of the criminal reform legislation that was passed and the work that’s been done in the White House by Jared and others, we specifically designed the program, and the five years was significantly shorter than what had been done before.\\xa0 So we had already taken that into account.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And there is no consideration of (inaudible)?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 For now, we’re not going to do that.\\xa0 But I want to just emphasize: We did take this into account.\\xa0 There were a lot of people that wouldn’t have access previously, and we changed those regulations.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Secretary, the President talked about a phase four.\\xa0 I know we all understand the circumstances and why businesses need this, but how many more phases can we afford to have or can businesses expect to have?\\xa0 Do you see a phase five, a phase six, a phase seven?\\xa0 What’s your thinking on this?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, first of all, I very much appreciate the President’s support for phase four.\\xa0 He put out a tweet.\\xa0 As the President said, we would look forward to phase four; it would be infrastructure.\\xa0 The President has been talking about infrastructure since the campaign: roads, bridges, broadband.\\xa0 Especially, broadband now to rural America is very important.\\n\\nWe’ve talked about incentives for restaurants, sports, entertainment, because these businesses have been impacted.\\xa0 The President has talked multiple times about a payroll tax cut.\\n\\nAnd we’ve also — we’re talking about, in the case of states, the states — we’ve heard from the governors and the fiscal issues of the states.\\n\\nI think phase four will most likely be what we need.\\xa0 I think based upon what we’re seeing and the reopening of the economy and the amount of money we’re putting in, and working with the Federal Reserve on 13(3), I think you’re going to see a lot of liquidity.\\xa0 And we look forward to business rebounding, especially later this summer.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And just real quick to follow up: In the PPP program, is this the last tranche of money you think you’re going to need for small businesses?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 We would expect this is the last tranche, but obviously we can always reconsider that.\\xa0 But this is a lot of money going out.\\n\\nAgain, let me just be clear: You know, it’s — it’s another $310 billion here and another $300 billion of loans.\\xa0 That’s over $600 billion putting into small businesses, which are the backbone of the economy: 50 percent of the private payroll.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How much do you think phase four will cost?\\xa0 And it will include all of those things?\\xa0 Payroll tax —\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 It would be premature for us to comment what the cost is.\\xa0 We’ll work with Congress on that, and we’ll consider it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And it’s going to have infrastructure and payroll?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Infrastructure could be a big investment.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 That’s going to be huge (inaudible) —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Secretary, given the size of the taxpayer dollars that are going out the door, have you fellas come to a different way of thinking about the need for oversight — independent oversight on behalf of the taxpayer?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 We have independent oversight.\\xa0 We supported it in the last legislation.\\xa0 Let me be very clear: We have a new inspector general.\\xa0 The President has already picked someone for that position.\\xa0 We look forward to the person being confirmed.\\xa0 We have an oversight committee of Congress that many of them have already been appointed.\\n\\nAnd let me just say, we put up last week, for full transparency — we had no obligation to do this.\\xa0 We put up — you can go to Treasury.gov — full transparency on the money that had been sent out on the PPP across states, showing all the big lenders, how it was distributed.\\xa0 No one lender did more than 4 percent.\\xa0 Showed the businesses.\\n\\nSo, again, the President and I very much believe in full transparency.\\xa0 We’re spending a lot of money, and we want to make sure that it’s done effectively and fairly.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, Secretary, thank you.\\xa0 You started by thanking the leaders in the House and the Senate.\\xa0 Can you tell us more about how easy or hard it was to deal with both sides?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, we’ve been working around the clock.\\xa0 I think there’s been very good bipartisan support to get this done. \\xa0The Congress is coming together, understanding the importance of this.\\xa0 And we’ve been working around the clock for days.\\n\\nSo this is important legislation.\\xa0 It was a lot.\\xa0 We spoke to a lot of people.\\xa0 Mark Meadows has been fantastic, as I said.\\xa0 It’s great to have him here in the White House.\\xa0 I couldn’t have done this without him working on this with me.\\xa0 And the President and Vice President have been available to us around the clock.\\xa0 So this was a big team effort.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And collaboration of the Democrats?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Absolutely.\\xa0 We couldn’t have done this today without unanimous consent and the Democrats being onboard.\\xa0 And we look forward to this being passed on a bipartisan basis tomorrow.\\xa0 This is a real example of the country coming together to fight this virus.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What is your best understanding of what Mitch McConnell wants from an infrastructure package?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Again, I think we’re not — we’re not at the point of designing that.\\xa0 Like every other bill, we will work with senators on both sides, on a bipartisan basis.\\n\\nI can tell you, there’s a lot of support, particularly for things like broadband and especially what’s going on today.\\xa0 But the President has talked about — you know, I was on the campaign with the President.\\xa0 We’ve been talking about bridges and tunnels and rebuilding this country for years.\\xa0 So the President wants to make a big investment in this.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But does Mitch McConnell?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\\xa0 When will we see the 17- billion-dollar portion of CARES reserved for companies — critical for national security?\\xa0 And also, will oil companies fit into that at all, per the President’s tweet?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 So we’re in the process of putting out guidance.\\xa0 That part was really designed for national security companies that are either major suppliers to the Department of Defense or companies that have top-secret clearance.\\n\\nSo, this — that national security provision was very clear when we did that.\\xa0 The President has asked me to work with the Secretary of Energy.\\xa0 Obviously, the energy business is very important to us.\\xa0 This has national security issues, but different.\\xa0 And we look forward to both looking at both existing capabilities we have, and that will be something we may need to go back to Congress and get additional funding for.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Will that look similar to an airplane — or airline bailout at all?\\xa0 Or what —\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 A completely different situation.\\xa0 I mean, what you have with the airlines is — you know, we had a very, very good airline industry.\\xa0 Because of the virus, they basically shut down.\\n\\nWe have a situation now, with the oil business — partially because of the virus, okay, for less demand, but partially also because of too much supply.\\xa0 But, you know, the President is determined: We want to maintain our energy independence.\\xa0 And the President has asked me to look at all of our options, and we’re doing that.\\xa0 Obviously, it’s a pretty extraordinary situation where you saw the front month of oil futures trade negative.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Hi.\\xa0 On the issue of the fourth stimulus bill and aid to state and local governments, any thoughts on whether that money should be proportionate to the rate of infection in states so that harder-hit states —\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, wait — interesting, but way too early to consider that.\\xa0 Whatever we do, we’ll do on a bipartisan basis.\\xa0 The President has listened to the governors.\\xa0 I’ve had the opportunity to be on multiple video conference calls with the President and the Vice President.\\xa0 We’re reaching out to a lot of people.\\xa0 There’s a lot of states that have been impacted, but way too early to figure out that level of design.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You mentioned if a large company applies for one of these loans and maybe manipulates or works the system or works the loopholes to get it, what are some of the consequences to a — you know, if a large company tries to get one of these PPP loans?\\xa0 What can you do?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, you used the word “manipulate”; I’m going to give people the benefit of the doubt.\\xa0 Again, we’re going to put up very clear guidance so that people understand what the certification is, what it means if you’re a big company.\\n\\nAgain, there is a provision for — you know, where there are multiple affiliates that people can access this, but the intent was not for companies that have access to plenty of liquidity and other sources.\\n\\nAnd again, if, to the extent these companies didn’t understand this and they repay the loans, that will be okay.\\xa0 And if not, there’ll be potentially other consequences.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But can you talk about what those consequences could be?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Again, you can look at the certifications.\\xa0 They’re quite significant.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 One more.\\xa0 Jon.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you have an estimate on how many jobs have been saved all with the money that’s gone out in PPP so far?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, I can tell you the PPP, so far, is over 30 million jobs.\\xa0 And again, that doesn’t account for other money that we’ve sent out.\\n\\nAnd again, we’re very pleased the direct deposits have gone out.\\xa0 We started sending out the checks.\\xa0 We’re also going to be supplementing our capability and sending prepaid debit cards so we can get money out quickly to people.\\n\\nSo everything that the President has had us working on is providing significant stability in the economy while we’re dealing with this difficult time when, for medical reasons, we’ve closed down major parts of the economy.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That was a very nice question.\\xa0 Very good.\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Steve.\\xa0 See you later.\\n\\nThat was a nice question, actually.\\xa0 It’s a good question, too.\\n\\nSo the noble fight against the invisible enemy has inflicted a steep toll on the American workforce.\\xa0 As we all know, millions of Americans sacrificed their jobs in order to battle the virus and save the lives of our fellow citizens.\\xa0 We have a solemn duty to ensure these unemployed Americans regain their jobs and their livelihoods.\\n\\nTherefore, in order to protect American workers, I will be issuing a temporary suspension of immigration into the United States; you heard about that last night.\\xa0 By pausing immigration, we’ll help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens.\\xa0 So important.\\xa0 It would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labor flown in from abroad.\\xa0 We must first take care of the American worker — take care of the American worker.\\n\\nThis pause will be in effect for 60 days, after which the need for any extension or modification will be evaluated by myself and a group of people, based on economic conditions at the time.\\xa0 This order will only apply to individuals seeking a permanent residency.\\xa0 In other words, those receiving green cards — a big factor — it will not apply to those entering on a temporary basis.\\n\\nAs we move forward, we’ll examine what additional immigration-related measures should be put in place to protect U.S. workers.\\xa0 We want to protect our U.S. workers.\\xa0 And I think, as we move forward, we will become more and more protective of them.\\n\\nThis pause on new immigration will also help to conserve vital medical resources for American citizens.\\xa0 A short break from new immigration, depending on the time we’re talking about, will protect the solvency of our healthcare system and provide relief to jobless Americans.\\n\\nToday, Vice President Pence visited the hardworking men and women of General Electric Healthcare in Madison, Wisconsin, who are working three shifts a day to quadruple their production of ventilators.\\n\\nWe’re way ahead of schedule on ventilators, as you know.\\xa0 That’s why it’s never brought up by the media.\\xa0 They don’t like to bring things up when we’re doing so well.\\xa0 GE is also working with Ford to make 50,000 ventilators in the next 100 days — more than our entire country typically produces in a very long period of time.\\xa0 Doing that in a matter of a few weeks and a few days.\\n\\nEarlier today, I had a very productive meeting with Governor Cuomo, as you probably saw, to discuss his statewide testing strategy and how we can work together to help expand it, with the goal of doubling testing in the next few weeks.\\xa0 And New York State will be continuing to control the testing of their citizens and will also manage the state and local laboratories.\\xa0 They have a lot of great laboratories there — more than anybody would ever have known, frankly.\\n\\nThe federal government will work along with the state on the national manufacturers and distributors.\\xa0 Together, we’ll all work together to help them secure additional tests, and we hope that this model will work with the other states as well.\\xa0 I think it will, for the most part.\\xa0 New York has a lot of very exceptional laboratories, but most of the states do.\\xa0 It’s — you saw the chart yesterday.\\xa0 Most of the states do.\\n\\nI’m proud of the relationship my administration has forged with New York and, I can say very honestly, with New York State and New York City.\\xa0 They’ve been terrific to work with.\\xa0 The New York metropolitan area has been the epicenter of the outbreak here in America, and the federal government has spared no expense or resource to get New Yorkers the care they need and the care they deserve.\\xa0 We’ve sent over 5 million masks.\\xa0 We had 5 million masks.\\xa0 And now that number, as of about two days from now, will be more than doubled.\\n\\nThousands of ventilators — in fact, so many ventilators that the governor is going to be sending up some to — to Massachusetts and a couple of other locations.\\xa0 We have a great deal of ventilators, which people thought would be impossible about a month ago.\\n\\nThousands of hospital beds and the USNS Comfort was sent, as you know, to New York.\\xa0 And it was originally for more of a normal medical purpose, and we changed it over so that it could take care of people that had the unfortunate circumstance of going through the problem that we — that we know so well; unfortunately, that we know so well.\\n\\nI said from the beginning that no American who needs a ventilator would be denied a ventilator and we have kept that promise all over the United States.\\xa0 Think of that.\\xa0 Other countries are desperate for ventilators.\\xa0 They have many deaths because they don’t have a ventilator.\\n\\nAnd I’ve asked Andrew if we could bring the Comfort back to its base in Virginia so that we can have it for other locations, and he said we would be able to do that.\\xa0 Javits Center has been a great help to them, but we’ll be bringing the ship back at the earliest time.\\xa0 And we’ll get it ready for its next mission, which will, I’m sure, be a very important one also.\\xa0 But it was — it was an honor.\\xa0 They — they reconverted it after it got there into handling an event that they were not expecting to be handling.\\n\\nThe FDA has now authorized more than 50 diagnostic tests, including, as of late last night, the first test — test that a patient can take home.\\xa0 You can take it at home and it’s highly accurate.\\xa0 LabCorp intends to make the home collection kits available to consumers in most states with a doctor’s order in the coming weeks.\\n\\nWe also have four different antibody tests already authorized.\\xa0 Tests will help identify individuals who can donate convalescent plasma, thus providing potentially lifesaving antibodies to American patients.\\n\\nDr. Hahn will be providing you with an update on these developments in a few moments.\\xa0 He’s done a great job at the FDA.\\nWe continue to gain ground in the war against the unseen enemy and I see light at the end of the tunnel.\\xa0 I actually see a lot of light at the end of the tunnel.\\xa0 And we’re starting the process.\\xa0 We’re starting a very, very powerful, important process.\\xa0 You see that people are getting very anxious.\\xa0 They want to get going.\\xa0 They want to get back to their jobs.\\xa0 They want to make money.\\xa0 They want to take care of their families.\\xa0 So, the light is getting brighter and brighter every day.\\n\\nAnd, with that, if I could, I’ll ask Dr. Birx to come up and then Dr. Hahn.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 So, looking at all of the information across the United States, we do see improvement across all the large metros.\\xa0 I know you know that we’ve been talking about the New York metro area, New York City, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Long Island.\\xa0 And, really, we do start to see improvement there, and we see improvement, even now, in Rhode Island and Connecticut.\\n\\nThe Detroit metro is doing quite well with significant declines now.\\xa0 New Orleans is nearly back to their baseline of where they started for new infections.\\xa0 We also are seeing improvements in Chicago and Boston.\\xa0 And that has been a great concern for us over the last several weeks.\\xa0 They appear now to be flattening.\\n\\nBoth also Philadelphia and Houston, Atlanta, Nashville, Baltimore, Indianapolis, and St. Louis also appear to be flattening.\\xa0 The D.C. metro area, we don’t see a decline yet, so hopefully all of you are still social distancing and doing everything that you can.\\n\\nI wanted to remind everybody of two points:\\xa0When we brought up — and the President put out the guidelines for opening up America again — it was very clear to use data and to really work together to mitigate against any resurgence and also, critically, to protect the vulnerable.\\n\\nAnd what we’re seeing across rural America and in some of the smaller population states is we’re still seeing outbreaks in long-term care facilities.\\xa0 And we asked everyone in phase one to make sure that they continued their social distancing in public, to ensure that the vulnerable with comorbidities and other conditions and among the elderly were staying at home, and making sure we’re still providing service to them.\\n\\nBut as individual Americans, as we begin to open up, we also made it very clear that individual Americans need to continue all of their hygiene pieces: ensuring social distancing, washing hands, not touching their face, and making sure that they’re not bringing the virus home to vulnerable individuals within the household.\\xa0 And remember, those were to continue through all three phases.\\n\\nAnd so we really want to call people’s attention again to the guidelines.\\xa0 We are continuing to see outbreaks in nursing homes and in confined spaces.\\xa0 And I think, as Americans, we want to stop that.\\xa0 And we have the ability to do that by really paying attention to the guidelines that were to be in all three phases.\\n\\nAnd so I’m calling on the states again to note that an informed community, a knowledgeable community is a protected community.\\xa0 So make sure all of your states have your cases visible to the communities so they can make decisions and understand where the virus is in their community and understand how to tackle it with their state and local governments.\\xa0 This will be absolutely critical.\\n\\nAnd there’s surveillance that we called for to find asymptomatics before people get sick.\\xa0 As an early warning signal, we asked for those to be in the federal clinics in our inner city, more vulnerable areas, among indigenous populations, and of course, in our long-term care facilities and prisons, we really want to support state and local governments to move forward on these critical monitoring to protect individuals that may be in the most critically vulnerable states.\\n\\nWe will continue to see mortality and deaths among our American citizens, particularly in the cities, as they begin to move past peak because deaths will lag.\\xa0 And so we really need to continue to unite and really, really, really support our healthcare providers who are still on the frontlines.\\xa0 They have been on the frontlines now for weeks and weeks and weeks.\\n\\nAnd so no matter what city they have been in, they have not seen the relief that we’ve been able to talk about at the light of the end of the tunnel because of the delay in hospitalizations and death.\\n\\nSo to our healthcare providers, to our respiratory therapists, and to everyone in the labs:\\xa0Thank you for the work that you’re doing to protect Americans and give us one of the lowest mortality rates in the entire world.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Doctor, please.\\n\\nDR. HAHN:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President, and I just want to echo what Dr. Birx said just a few — few short months ago.\\xa0 I was one of those doctors on the frontlines and I know how terrific they’re working and how well they’re doing for the American people, and a shout-out to them for just the wonderful work that they — that they do every day.\\n\\nSo President Trump asked the FDA to remove all unnecessary barriers that were in place to help with the development of both diagnostics and therapeutics, and we have done that.\\xa0 I’m here to give you an update on FDA’s efforts around serologic tests, which, as you know, are antibody tests which detect, in the blood, the natural immunity that someone might develop in response to infection — in this case, COVID-19.\\n\\nThese aren’t diagnostic tests, but these are tests that actually detect the antibody, so an indication that one has had the infection and has responded.\\xa0 And I think it’s important for everyone to understand that the timing of the response of the antibody to the infection isn’t completely known, but we know that it takes some time to actually develop that.\\xa0 And there’s two types of antibody responses that can be detected.\\n\\nAnd the antibody tests are just one piece of the larger response that you’ve heard in the America returning to work plan that the President has, with the task force, has developed.\\n\\nAnd this pandemic is truly unprecedented in nature, and you’ll see reports around the world of different antibody tests that have been used.\\xa0 And I think that’s a reflection of the fact that we’re just learning and beginning to understand what that response looks like.\\xa0 And many of these tests have different characteristics that allow to detect at different points in the infection.\\n\\nI do want to address one issue that we are laser focused on at FDA, and that is: In an effort to provide laboratories and healthcare providers the early access to tests, we issued a policy earlier in March that allowed test developers the opportunity to quickly get their test to market and address the needs of the nation as posed by the epidemic.\\n\\nIn March, we provided this regulatory flexibility to manufacturers, and here’s what we required of them:\\xa0The manufacturers had to validate their tests; we call it self-validation, similar to what many test developers in the world have done.\\xa0 They had to notify FDA that they had performed that validation.\\xa0 And then they had to label their products appropriately in the package insert with information about the validation, as well as the fact that it’s not a diagnostic test, that it’s an antibody test.\\n\\nAnd the bottom line here is that FDA still expects manufacturers and test developers to validate their antibody tests, even under this revised policy.\\n\\nNow, we’ve done a couple of things to actually help end users, to help laboratories, providers, et cetera, states, in terms of their use of these antibody tests.\\xa0 One is that we’re working with CDC and NCI to actually validate some of the more than 90 manufacturers who have notified us that they brought their test to market to do an independent validation.\\xa0 And that process is going.\\xa0 We expect to hear more information this week about that, and we will provide that information in a transparent manner.\\n\\nAnd we also want to go after anyone who is saying that that test has been authorized or has been approved by the FDA but actually hasn’t.\\xa0 And we’ve authorized for applications for antibody tests, and 140 test developers are pursuing applications for us as we speak.\\xa0 So it’s not okay for someone to say that a test has been authorized or approved by FDA when it hasn’t.\\xa0 And we are pursuing them both by — in direct contact with the manufacturers, but also at the border.\\n\\nAnd so we have increased these interdiction efforts, and we will continue to outreach and do — and do that with the manufacturers to make sure that we provide the most up-to-date information to the end users of these products.\\xa0 And we will continue to do — make all of our efforts, both in the diagnostics and the therapeutics, to help America open up again.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Hahn?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Hahn, you’re speaking of 140 different developers, more than 90 manufacturers.\\xa0 How many of these tests actually work?\\n\\nDR. HAHN:\\xa0 So, as I mentioned, the 90 that have come forward and said they’re marketing in the U.S., they are required by us to have self-validation, and they’re required to label that appropriately in their package insert.\\n\\nAnd I also said that we’re — what we’re doing is we’re working with folks around the country, but here at home, the U.S. government and with the NCI and CDC, to validate some of those tests that have come forward to us.\\xa0 So we’re actually doing some independent validation.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And what have you found so far?\\n\\nDR. HAHN:\\xa0 So we don’t have those results yet.\\xa0 I expect to have more results this week, but we will be transparent about those results because you’ll think it’s very important.\\n\\nAnd your question is superb in that if someone wants to use a test that’s come to market, really, it’s important to read the information that’s in the package insert, but often in some of those cases, it’s also important for the independent labs to do the validation also.\\n\\nAnd you may have seen reports in the press of labs around the country that have done that.\\xa0 We’ve actually reached out to them — many academics — and we will be including that information and the information that we generate as well to provide to the American people.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Hahn, while have you here: There was a study out of the VA today on hydroxychloroquine that found a higher mortality rate compared to those who got standard of care.\\xa0 And I know this isn’t a large-scale clinical trial, but since this drug is out there and people are using it, can you give some takeaways from that study?\\xa0 Did that change your thinking at all on hydroxychloroquine?\\n\\nDR. HAHN:\\xa0 So this study is a small retrospective study at the VA.\\xa0 And similar to the data we talked about before with the French study, this is something that a doctor would need to consider as part of a decision in writing prescription for hydroxychloroquine.\\n\\nAnd as I’ve mentioned from this podium and in other venues before, what FDA is going to require is data from clinical trials — randomized clinical trials — hydroxychloroquine placebo, to actually make a definitive decision around safety and efficacy.\\n\\nBut the preliminary data are helpful to providers.\\xa0 And doctors, I want to ask them to incorporate the data as we have come forward.\\xa0 And it’s not definitive data; it doesn’t help us make a decision from a regulatory point of view.\\xa0 But doctors should incorporate that in the decision making they make on a one-on-one basis.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And just the timeline on the clinical trials and when we will be getting a readout of that data?\\n\\nDR. HAHN:\\xa0 So the good news is we have over 30 clinical trials.\\xa0 Now, the settings are very different.\\xa0 They’re in the outpatient setting, they’re in the inpatient setting, and also, I think very importantly, in what we call the post-exposure prophylaxis, meaning if you’re a healthcare worker or a frontline provider and you’ve been exposed to the virus, take the drug for a period of time to see if you can prevent the development of illness related to the virus.\\xa0 So all those trials are in progress and will probably be early summer before we get a readout.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And, Mr. President, if I can pick up on that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And all of these tests, I want to say, are in addition to the test that we already have.\\xa0 And we have tested more people than anybody anywhere in the world, by far — by very far.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, if I can —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Bret, do you have a question?\\n\\nQ \\xa0\\xa0 Well, I think you wanted to follow up on the hydroxychloroquine and the —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, the hydroxychloroquine.\\xa0 I’m wondering if you’re concerned — this VA study showed that actually more people died that used the drug than didn’t.\\xa0 And I’m wondering if Governor Cuomo brought you back any results on —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, we didn’t discuss it, and I don’t know of the report.\\xa0 Obviously, there have been some very good reports and perhaps this one is not a good report.\\xa0 But we’ll be looking at it.\\xa0 We’ll have a comment on it as soon —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And a panel of experts at the NIH is actually now recommending against the use of hydroxychloroquine in combination with Z-Pak, which is something you’ve —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Well, we’ll take a look at that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — been recommending.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m always willing to take a look.\\n\\nBret?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Another subject.\\xa0 Your signing the executive order.\\xa0 When do you plan to do that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The executive order will be — it’s being written now, as we speak.\\xa0 Probably tomorrow sometime.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So will have exemptions in there for certain —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’ll have certain exemptions, because you’re going to need certain exemptions.\\xa0 But we’ll be notifying you tomorrow.\\xa0 We’ll sign it, most likely, tomorrow.\\xa0 Being drawn now and tonight.\\xa0 And it’s something we have to have in this country.\\xa0 We have to have it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So for the people who say it doesn’t track with opening up the country to shut down immigration across the board for companies that and — and the pipeline that’s already in place, what do you say to them?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think it really does, I think it’s very strong, obviously.\\xa0 And it’s countrywide, as opposed to specifically, like China or some of the other ones that I’ve shut down.\\xa0 We’re going to see.\\xa0 And you’ll see a very accurate definition tomorrow after it’s completed by the attorneys.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Last thing from me: North Korea.\\xa0 What do you — what can you tell us about the status of Kim Jong Un?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, these are reports that came out, and we don’t know.\\xa0 We don’t know.\\xa0 I’ve had a very good relationship with him.\\xa0 I wouldn’t — you know, I can only say this: I wish him well.\\xa0 Because if he is in the kind of condition that the reports say, that the news is saying, that would be a — that’s a very serious condition, as you know.\\n\\nBut I wish him well.\\xa0 We’ve had a good relationship.\\xa0 I’ve said it — I’ve said it many times: If somebody else were in this position, we would have been right now at war with North Korea.\\xa0 And we’re not at war, and we’re nowhere close to war with North Korea.\\n\\nSo I just have to say to Kim Jong Un, I wish him very — you know, good luck.\\xa0 Good luck.\\xa0 I mean, they came out with very, very serious medical reports.\\xa0 Nobody has confirmed that.\\xa0 It’s — it was CNN that came out.\\xa0 So when CNN comes out with a report, I don’t place too much credence in it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 In your meeting with Governor Cuomo, did he convince you of a need for expanded testing?\\xa0 Or how did that (inaudible)?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, we had a great talk on testing.\\xa0 And we have an agreement — we have an understanding on testing.\\xa0 They have labs — tremendous labs, as you know — in New York, especially in the Manhattan area, but all over the state, and great, great medical schools and federal labs.\\xa0 So we have a very good understanding.\\xa0 We’re going to do very significant testing.\\n\\nYou know, not everybody wants to do such significant testing.\\xa0 Testing is good in some cases and, in some cases, it’s not.\\xa0 You have governors that don’t want to go all out on the testing because they think they can do it in a different manner and do it better.\\xa0 But we had a very good meeting today.\\xa0 The governor and I had a very good meeting.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is there more federal aid that can be used to help governors who want to expand testing?\\xa0 Because we keep hearing that, all day long, governors want more —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0Yeah, well, we have — we have $25 billion.\\xa0 And that’s a tremendous amount of money.\\xa0 That’s far more money than, in my opinion, than we’ll need.\\n\\nAnd again, already we’re testing more, by far, than any country.\\xa0 I think I read yesterday a report that we’ve done more than everybody else, every other country combined.\\xa0 And I think our people should be getting a lot of credit for that.\\xa0 We’ve done a lot — more than everybody else combined — and you never hear that in the news.\\xa0 It’s, you know, unfortunate.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Just back on the executive order for a second.\\xa0 You mentioned the — that there are going to be some exemptions.\\xa0 We’re reporting right now that it only applies to employment and green — green cards for employment, but not those for immediate family.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it is green cards.\\xa0 But we’re going to be reporting on that later on.\\xa0 It might be tonight or tomorrow.\\xa0 We’ll give you an exact report.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is there anything you can say to people who may be worried about the ability to bring immediate family members into this country?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I think it’s been covered pretty accurately, in this case.\\xa0 I think most people know what it is.\\xa0 And some people will be able to get in.\\xa0 We have to do that, obviously, even from a humane standpoint.\\xa0 But there’ll be — there’ll be some people coming in.\\xa0 But it’s a — it’s a strong order.\\xa0 It’s a strong order.\\xa0 It involves a big, big circle, as you know.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are immigrants who are already in the country, are they at greater risk of deportation based on this order?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t think that.\\xa0 Well, I don’t think so.\\xa0 They’re not supposed to be here.\\xa0 You’re saying they’re here illegally?\\xa0 Is that what you’re saying?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, for example, if an immigrant is here for a court order, right, are they at risk of deportation based on this?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, if a court order, then you have to go to court.\\xa0 So then the judge would make a determination as to whether or not they’re going to be staying.\\xa0 But if they have a court order, they won’t have to leave until they go through that process.\\xa0 So we’ll see what happens.\\xa0 But with the court — and there are some with court orders.\\xa0 That means they have a trial coming up.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, so, obviously, on the immigration executive order, you’ve raised concern for a long time, even in good economic times, about immigrants taking Americans’ jobs.\\xa0 So under what conditions would you consider lifting this halt on immigration?\\xa0 And —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re going to — yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Or is this sort of an opportunity to address what you’ve seen as a problem for a long time?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think — look, right now, obviously there’s never been — we had the greatest economy in the world and then, one day, we had to shut it down.\\xa0 They said, “You have to shut it down.”\\xa0 We did the right thing, because I think we would have had a million or maybe even 2 million — and maybe more than that — deaths.\\xa0 So we did the right thing.\\n\\nBut certainly, this would pertain.\\xa0 I mean, when you look at it, right now the last thing we want to do is take American workers’ jobs.\\xa0 It’s one thing when we were at essentially — they used to call it “full employment.”\\xa0 And it’s another thing right now.\\xa0 Right now, we have people that have lost their jobs and we hope they’re going to come back and come back fast, and then we can have an even deeper discussion.\\xa0 But, right now, we have to have jobs for Americans.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Would you have any sense of, like, if unemployment gets to 4 percent or 5 percent — you know, people who are looking to come to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’ll have to see.\\xa0 I mean, I hope we’re in that position to have that debate.\\xa0 Right now, we’re not in that position.\\xa0 Right now, we closed down a — the largest economy, the greatest economy in the history of the world.\\xa0 It’s the most successful economy.\\xa0 When you look at the stock market, we were breaking records virtually every week, sometimes every day.\\xa0 And the stock market is still not doing badly, considering what this country has been through, which really tells you how strong it was in the first place.\\n\\nBut, no, I hope we’re going to be able to have that discussion.\\xa0 I hope we’re in a position — that’s like a good discussion to have.\\xa0 But that’ll be a little bit later.\\n\\nBret.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I have a question for Dr. Birx about — the CDC director said in an interview that perhaps this second wave of coronavirus in the fall could be worse because it is timed with the seasonal flu.\\xa0 Just wondering if you could talk about that in context of — as you’re opening up the country and these guidelines that you’ve laid out.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yeah, so we were very clear in the guidelines that we believe we can monitor — again, monitor communities at the community level by using the influenza-like illness and the syndromic respiratory and gastrointestinal components of this — of this particular virus.\\n\\nObviously, when we have flu, we’re going to — and we’re working on an algorithm that you test for flu, and then you test for COVID, and making sure that we are building the testing capacity to be able to do that.\\xa0 Because I think it’s very important that you’re going to be able — on the surface, a patient, when they come in with early flu and early COVID, can look very close to identical.\\xa0 So we need to have testing in place to be able to separate and ensure those patients receive the best treatment.\\n\\nWe’re also hoping, by that time, that we have additional treatment options for people with COVID-19, so that there will be additional treatment available in the fall.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But your — your message would be to prepare for that time, thinking that it’ll come back together?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 The President has made it clear that we have the emergency, which we have been working on — the opening up guidelines.\\xa0 And just like he talks about phase four, he has us very much working on the next 60, 90, and for all on with fall.\\xa0 And that’s why he’s not stopped any of the ventilator orders.\\n\\nIt’s very important that we have a completely refreshed and a comprehensive stockpile going into the fall.\\xa0 And I think that’s why we’ve continued to bring in those shipments and work on the ventilators so that those would be available not only for the United States, but certainly if other — other partner countries have this level of tragedy.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Birx, a follow-up on that.\\xa0 So you agree this could come back actually worse in the fall?\\xa0 And what you need —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 I don’t know if it will be worse.\\xa0 I think this has been pretty bad.\\xa0 When you see what has happened in New York, that was very bad.\\xa0 I believe that we’ll have early warning signals, both from our surveillance that we’ve been talking on — about in these — on the vulnerable populations.\\xa0 We’re going to continue that surveillance from now all the way through the fall, to be able to give us that early warning signal.\\n\\nI think what we’ve learned is how good Americans are about immediately reverting to all of those issues that they need to do in order to ensure that they are protected and their families.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And Mr. President, what — what do you say to the concerns — like, Georgia is opening up barbershops and bowling alleys and the like?\\xa0 And you saw Lindsey Graham is saying he’s concerned that Georgia may be going too far too fast, and it could affect people in South Carolina. Obviously, people travel back and forth between states.\\xa0 How do you protect the people of South Carolina, for example, from a potentially bad decision by a governor in Georgia?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So he’s a very capable man.\\xa0 He knows what he’s doing.\\xa0 He’s done a very good job as governor — Georgia.\\xa0 And — and, by the way, and South Carolina.\\xa0 Governor McMaster also.\\xa0 So you have two very capable people.\\xa0 We’re going to find out.\\n\\nAnd, in fact, I’m scheduled to speak to the governor of Georgia in a little while.\\xa0 But we’ll — we’ll find out.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But what about Lindsey Graham’s concern that what happens in Georgia can affect someone in South Carolina?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, everybody — I have a concern about what happens everywhere.\\xa0 I mean, we’ve got those concerns.\\xa0 And as far as coming back, if they do come back — and they could come back together with heavy on the flu and much lighter on — because I really believe we’ll be able to put out the fires.\\xa0 You know, it’s like fires.\\n\\nAnd we’ve learned a lot.\\xa0 You know, we’ve become very good at this, when you look at what’s happening, when you look at the numbers coming down.\\xa0 A lot of states are in really great shape.\\xa0 You’re going to see a lot of openings.\\n\\nBut I’ll be speaking to the governor of Georgia in a little while.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, should the American people need to be prepared for going back to social distancing, even if things relax over the summers — over the summer, but come the fall, if the virus comes back in coincidence with the flu?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I could see them — and I’ll speak for the doctor, and, if you’d like, either of you, to say — but I would say that you keep away until this thing is gone.\\xa0 It’s going to be gone at some point.\\xa0 It’s going to be gone, gone.\\xa0 And I would say you keep away and you do the social distancing until such time as you know it’s gone.\\xa0 We’ll know when that time is.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Your executive order is to last for 60 days.\\xa0 How will you decide whether to extend it?\\xa0 Does it depend upon —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I’ll look at the economy.\\xa0 We’ll see where we are with the economy, basically.\\xa0 And I think I’ll have a very easy decision to make.\\xa0 I hope — I hope that the economy is going to be great by that time, but we’ll see.\\xa0 But, right now, in light of the fact that Americans are out of jobs, I can’t be hav- — I can’t be taking in.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And then, would you roll it for another 60 days or a different period?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I could, or I could roll it for 30 days, or I could roll it for much more than 60 days.\\xa0 We’ll have to take a look at the time.\\xa0 But we’ll be looking at 60 days and we’ll see what it is.\\n\\nYeah, in the back.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 On your immigration order —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And there is reporting that you —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On your immigration order —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, that’s all right.\\xa0 You go.\\xa0 Why don’t you go and then you.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay, on the immigration order — we’ll continue with that — there is reporting that you may actually sign a second order to even limit more of those exceptions that you were just talking about.\\xa0 Can you confirm that you are considering —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It could happen if I want. \\xa0But I won’t be doing it tomorrow.\\xa0 I’ll be signing the primary order.\\xa0 And then we have a secondary order that, if I want to do that, we’ll make that determination.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And is that —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We can do that.\\xa0 Yeah, we can do that at a little bit different time if we want.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But that is under consideration at this time — a second order?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, sure.\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 Secondary orders, yeah.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 I have two questions: one from me and one from a reporter who couldn’t be in the room because of social distancing.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You always that: one from him and one from her.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 That’s this seat.\\xa0 This is the print pooler’s seat.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s okay.\\xa0 Good.\\xa0 That’s good.\\xa0 Fine.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So my first question is about your immigration order.\\xa0 You campaigned on reducing legal immigration.\\xa0 I remember your speech in Phoenix in 2016 on reducing legal immigration.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I campaigned on legal and illegal.\\xa0 But, no, I’ve always said you have to come into the country legally.\\xa0 So, not legal.\\xa0 What I campaigned on was people just flooding our border and stopping.\\xa0 And, by the way, speaking of that, we have 170 miles — almost 170 miles of — of very powerful border wall up, and it’s moving rapidly, very quickly, and it’s having a tremendous impact.\\xa0 And it’s making our job a lot easier.\\n\\nPlus, Mexico has 27,000 soldiers right now on our southern border that we share with them.\\xa0 And Mexico has been terrific.\\xa0 They’ve really helped.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You also campaigned on reducing legal immigration.\\xa0 And I’m wondering if — some critics are saying that you are using the virus now and this crisis to follow through on that promise to reduce legal immigration in the country.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I’m not doing that.\\xa0 No, no.\\xa0 Well, I want people that are in this country — I want our citizens to get jobs.\\xa0 I don’t want them to have competition.\\xa0 We have a very unusual situation where something came in that nobody has seen for many, many decades.\\xa0 Probably 1917 would be the closest analogy, if you look at it — when you look at the contagion, the kind of contagion we’re talking about.\\n\\nSo, no, I’m not — I’m not doing that at all.\\xa0 I want — I want the American worker and the American — our American citizens to be able to get jobs.\\xa0 I don’t want them to compete right now.\\xa0 There’s a big difference when we have a full economy, and frankly, where some of the companies — we have many companies moving in, where they need actually — they need workers.\\xa0 That’s a big difference between that and where, all of a sudden, a lot of people lose jobs.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 As you know, a lot of farmers rely on seasonal migrant workers that come in on the H-2A.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, that’s not going to be affected.\\xa0 The farmers will not be —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you going to (inaudible) carve-out —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s an important point.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — for the seasonal H-2A workers?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The farmers will not be affected.\\xa0 Yeah, that’s a very important point.\\xa0 I mean, it’s a great point, actually.\\xa0 I’m — I’m glad you brought it up.\\xa0 No, the farmers will not be affected.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Your EO will have a carve-out for those workers (inaudible)?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You know, they’ve had cases where they — where they stopped everybody from coming in, and all the farmers went out of business.\\xa0 They were literally out of business.\\xa0 You remember that, Bret.\\xa0 It was not so long ago.\\xa0 But they — it’s easy — you know, it’s easier to stop everything cold than it is to plan it so that the farmers have the people that have been working on those farms for many years.\\xa0 And — and that’s what we’re doing.\\n\\nNo, the farmers will not be affected by this at all.\\xa0 If anything, we’re going to make it easier, and we’re doing a process that’ll make it better for those workers to come in, to go to the farm where they’ve been for a long time.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And now for a question from a reporter who’s out of the room.\\xa0 This is from the Washington Times, Tom Howell:\\xa0Why hasn’t the CDC, the federal government’s main disease-fighting agency, had a more public-facing role amid the pandemic?\\xa0 It was holding regular media calls early on but has not held one since early to mid-March.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I can’t tell you that.\\xa0 The CDC has been terrific.\\xa0 We’ve worked with them very closely.\\xa0 They were very much involved, even in the border decision that I made last night.\\xa0 And the director is —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible) CDC to hold more media calls?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — the director is doing a good job.\\xa0 And we have always — whether it’s Tony or Deborah or Steve — we have always a lot of people up.\\xa0 And certainly, as you’ve seen, the director has been here a lot.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 He’s been here, he’s been sitting here.\\xa0 He’s been speaking a lot.\\n\\nNo, no, CDC is very much involved in everything we’ve done.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The director of the CDC said that protests against stay-at-home orders are not helpful.\\xa0 You’ve encouraged some of these protests.\\xa0 What are your thoughts on the CDC director saying that these protests are not a good idea?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, people — look, it’s not a question of helpful or not.\\xa0 People want to get back to work.\\xa0 And I’ve watched some of the protests, not in great detail, but I’ve seen that.\\xa0 And they’re separated, they’re — a lot of space in between.\\xa0 I mean, they — they’re watching, believe it or not, social — they’re doing social distancing, if you can believe it.\\xa0 And they are.\\xa0 And they’re protesting, but they — they’re — the groups I’ve seen have been very much spread out.\\xa0 So I think that’s good.\\n\\nLook, people — they want to get back to work, they got to make a living.\\xa0 They have to take care of their family.\\xa0 They don’t want to do this.\\xa0 It’s, you know, unfortunate, maybe, one way or the other.\\xa0 Both are unfortunate.\\xa0 Both are unfortunate.\\xa0 But you have a lot of people out there that are anxious to get back.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Surveys seem to be indicating that people are actually more concerned.\\xa0 More people are concerned about the virus spread and they don’t want to go out.\\xa0 They don’t want to go to work; they don’t want to go outside.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 No, that’s true.\\xa0 They’re — they’re both — there are two groups.\\xa0 They’re both — they’re big groups, both of them.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So my question is: What — what good is it for these businesses that would reopen if the customers are afraid to go outside?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, at the same time, we have to build back our country.\\xa0 And I’m going to make our country bigger and better and stronger, and we have to get started.\\xa0 There’s a big difference, though, because people have really been through a lot.\\xa0 And they understand what to do now.\\n\\nBefore, nobody had ever heard of a thing like this, wouldn’t you say?\\xa0 I mean, nobody ever heard of a thing like this — distancing — social distancing.\\xa0 What does that mean?\\xa0 Washing your hands every 15 minutes.\\xa0 What does that mean?\\xa0 I mean, people had never seen or heard about anything like this.\\xa0 Now they really are.\\xa0 They’ve — they’ve — not only have they done it, but they’ve done a good job of it.\\n\\nBut you have people — you can’t break the country.\\xa0 At some point, you have to go back.\\xa0 Now, hopefully the governors are going to do, because I want the governors — and I’ve always wanted that.\\xa0 You can call it federalism, you can call it whatever you want.\\n\\nBut the governors — I want them to do it.\\xa0 If they — if we see them doing something we don’t like, we’ll stop it very quickly.\\xa0 But they’re doing a good job.\\xa0 They’re being careful.\\xa0 Some of the governors, frankly, they’re in a position where they can do it sooner or they can do it a little bit later, and that’s okay.\\xa0 But people — they don’t want to — they — they need money, they need help.\\n\\nWe’re going to lose — and we can’t break our country over this.\\xa0 We can’t do it.\\xa0 We have to get going.\\xa0 With that being said, some are going to go soon and some are not.\\n\\nYeah, in the back, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If I might just — pardon me.\\xa0 Hair salons, nail salons, tattoo parlors.\\xa0 Dr. Birx, can you weigh in on this?\\xa0 Because the people of Atlanta want to hear from you as well, as much as they want to hear from their governor and from you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I think — I think it’s fine.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What — what about — how do you success- — safely have hair salons and nail salons and tattoo parlors where people apparently —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Where is that?\\xa0 Where is that?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This is in Georgia.\\xa0 Where people have to inherently be close together.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 I think what I’ve been trying to communicate over the last several days is it’s really important that the governors and mayors communicate critical information to their communities and show very clearly the data.\\n\\nRemember we wanted this data and evidence-based — the data that they utilize to make decisions and the data that the mayors should use in each of the communities, because it will have to be on a community-by-community opening because there are different communities in different places, even in Georgia.\\n\\nAnd so I believe people in Atlanta would understand that if their cases are not going down, that they need to continue to do everything that we said:\\xa0social distancing, washing your hands, wearing a mask in public.\\n\\nSo if there’s a way that people can social distance and do those things, then they can do those things.\\xa0 I don’t know how, but people are very creative.\\xa0 So I’m not going to prejudge, but we have told people, very clearly, and the President’s guidelines made it very clear about the expectations of phase one.\\n\\nAnd remember, phase one also included social distancing in restaurants, social distancing in every place that was entertainment, and keeping your own individual social groups to less than 10.\\xa0 I mean, we’ve been very clear in the guidelines, and I think it’s up to the governors and mayors to ensure that they’re following the best they can each of those phases to make sure that both the public is completely protected.\\n\\nBut the governors and mayors also need to communicate very clearly on the data that was used for decision making and make that transparent and available to their communities.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And it also depends — as an example that you just gave — are they doing testing before they go in?\\xa0 We have to find that out.\\xa0 That’s why I’m speaking to the governor in a little while, and I’ll be asking him those questions.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 I’m just trying to get a sense of what you have left in the toolbox as it relates to oil.\\xa0 You hashed out the deal with OPEC Plus.\\xa0 You’ve ordered for purchases into the SPR.\\xa0 I mean, what else can be done?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, the biggest thing in the tool — the toolbox is to get our country open.\\xa0 That’s, by far, the biggest thing there is.\\n\\nIf we can open pretty well — and I think we’re going to over a period of time; piece by piece, a puzzle, remember?\\xa0 If we can open well, I think that’s your biggest part by far.\\xa0 That’s where the engine is, more important than any other thing that we can work on.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Two New York-related questions.\\xa0 In your meeting with Governor Cuomo, was there talk about providing states, like New York, with aid in the fourth stimulus package?\\xa0 I’m wondering if you have any thoughts on whether that aid should be tied to infection rates; whether states like New York, New Jersey that have been hardest hit should receive more money.\\n\\nAnd also wondering if you have any thoughts on Mayor Bill de Blasio saying today that he’d like to host a ticker-tape parade of sorts, once this is all over, to honor the healthcare workers.\\xa0 As a New Yorker, do you have any —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, frankly, that sounds like a good idea to me, when it’s all over.\\xa0 That sounds like a great idea.\\xa0 They deserve it.\\xa0 They’re warriors.\\xa0 They’ve done an incredible job.\\n\\nWe mentioned briefly the state aid.\\xa0 We talked about that — Governor Cuomo and myself — and I agree with him on that.\\xa0 And I think most Republicans agree too, and Democrats.\\xa0 And that’s part of phase four.\\n\\nAnd I think infrastructure is going to be a big part.\\xa0 We have to rebuild our country.\\xa0 I mean, you take a look where we spend — and we go over this all the time — but $8 trillion in the Middle East.\\xa0 We want to rebuild our country, and that means our bridges, our tunnels, even schools.\\xa0 We’re doing something with schools.\\xa0 We have to do our roadways.\\xa0 They’re — what’s happened?\\xa0 We spend so much money on other countries that don’t even — that they don’t appreciate it.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 They don’t appreciate it.\\n\\nWe’re going to spend money now on our country, and we’re going to have — it’s going to be our jobs, and it’s going to be our equipment.\\xa0 It’s going to be made — much of it is going to be made here.\\xa0 Hopefully, at some point, all of it’s going to be made here.\\n\\nJon?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, at that podium back on March 9th, Vice President Pence said that over a million tests had been distributed.\\xa0 And then he said, and this is an exact quote, “Before the end of this week, another 4 million tests will be distributed.”\\xa0 As you know now, six weeks later, we still aren’t at 4 million tests.\\xa0 What —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know — I don’t know what his statement —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What went wrong with the testing?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Ready?\\xa0 Are you ready?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Again, I’ll say it for the fifth time: We have tested more than any country in the world.\\xa0 And some of the countries are very big.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 More than any country in the world.\\xa0 We have one of the most successful — if you call mortality — rates because one person — and I always say that for you in particular — one person is too many.\\n\\nBut we’ve done very well — our testing.\\xa0 If you add them all up, we’ve — we’ve tested more.\\xa0 Now, I don’t know what Mike Pence said, but I’m sure he could answer that question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, he said 4 million — he said 4 million tests, and we’re — six months later, we’re not even at that point.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You know what?\\xa0 You ready, again?\\xa0 We’ve tested more than every country in the world, even put together.\\xa0 So that’s all I can say.\\xa0 As far as Mike, he’ll answer your question when he’s here.\\xa0 He’ll be back tomorrow.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 It’s — I just want to go back to the China deal and the phase one of this China deal.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The flight ban is still in place.\\xa0 How confident are you that the Chinese are not going to use — invoke the natural disaster clause to just wait before getting into their —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re going to see.\\xa0 Look, there’s nobody ever been tougher on China than me.\\xa0 And that means for 20 years.\\xa0 You go back 20 years.\\xa0 I probably got elected, at least partially, on the fact that I’ve been very tough.\\xa0 I said China has been ripping us off for years.”\\xa0 I’d go into Michigan, I’d go into Pennsylvania, and make speeches unrelated to being a politician.\\xa0 I’d be invited.\\xa0 I’d be speaking to people — which I like to do because I love the people, I love the people of this country.\\xa0 And I’d make speeches — nobody — I’d say, “How did you let this happen with China?”\\n\\nI even asked the leaders of China, “How — how did this ever happen where our country loses tens of billions of dollars a year?”\\xa0 And I don’t mean just tens.\\xa0 Take a look: $200 billion, $300 billion, $400 billion, $500 billion a year.\\xa0 How did they ever let a thing like this happen?\\n\\nNow, if you look at this last year, the deficit went way down.\\xa0 And I’m talking about even before; now it’s much different.\\xa0 But a lot of things are happening.\\xa0 Great things were happening, except, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, came the invisible enemy.\\xa0 And we think we know where it came from, and we’ll be talking about that probably a lot.\\xa0 But came — the invisible enemy.\\xa0 There’s been nobody tougher than me on China.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you have no guarantee that they are going to go ahead with this phase one?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no.\\xa0 But if that happens, we’ll do a termination and we’ll do what I can do better than anybody.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, on China: Have U.S. intelligence analysts told you that they think that the virus escaped from a Chinese research lab, that it was — infected someone?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I can’t tell you that.\\xa0 “Have U.S. intelligence agents told me…” \\xa0I mean, what kind of a question is that?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you feel — do feel confident about it, that that happened?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I can’t — I can’t.\\xa0 You want me to tell you — oh, let me tell you what they told me.\\xa0 Look, they told me plenty.\\xa0 They told me plenty.\\n\\nBret?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I wanted to follow up on — you said about the small business program, Harvard is going to pay the money back.\\xa0 How confident are you that you can claw back money from places like Harvard?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I’m going to have to look.\\xa0 I don’t like when Harvard — that has, I think, a $40 billion endowment or some incredible amount of money — that Harvard gets this money.\\xa0 Harvard should pay that money back.\\xa0 I want Harvard to pay the money back.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 And if they won’t do that, then we won’t do something else.\\xa0 They have to pay it back.\\xa0 I don’t like it.\\xa0 I don’t like it.\\n\\nThis is meant for workers.\\xa0 This isn’t meant for one of the richest institutions, not only — far beyond schools — in the world.\\xa0 They got to pay it back.\\xa0 I want them to pay it back.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, your Florida clubs have had to furlough workers —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 That’s true.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have you thought about, you know, asking your family members to maybe keep some of those workers on the payroll to help — sending them to the federal coffer?\\xa0 We’ve seen companies — other companies do that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I — you know, yeah.\\xa0 In Doral, you’re not allowed to have the golf courses open.\\xa0 You can’t have the clubs open.\\xa0 You can’t have anything.\\xa0 It’s a — it’s a big hotel and resort.\\xa0 And I think there’s probably 700, 750 people.\\xa0 So you can’t have anything open.\\xa0 And you say, “What are we going to do?\\xa0 Have full payroll and have the whole place with…”\\xa0 You know, there’s no income coming in.\\n\\nFirst of all, everyone’s home and they’re supposed to be.\\xa0 Second of all, in Florida, you can’t use golf courses.\\xa0 That one, I’m not sure I agree with.\\xa0 You know, you have parks and golf courses where you have open space.\\xa0 But that’s what it is.\\n\\nSo I have others also.\\xa0 Then I have others in different states.\\xa0 I have a lot of different properties.\\xa0 But again, my children run them, and I love my children and I wish them well.\\xa0 I look forward to comparing my numbers to my children’s numbers.\\xa0 I think I’ll do better.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You haven’t thought about asking them to keep these —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You understand that.\\xa0 It’s called closed property, it’s like, you know, you have to close them up and then hopefully when things get better, we’ll just open it up.\\xa0 But you can’t have, you know, many hundreds of employees standing around doing nothing.\\xa0 There’s no customer.\\xa0 You’re not allowed to have a customer.\\n\\nSo, in some places, it’s very strict.\\xa0 New Jersey is strict.\\xa0 New York is strict.\\xa0 And you have to do what you have to do.\\xa0 And it’s too bad.\\xa0 I feel so badly when I see that.\\xa0 I think that it’s a tough policy, but I go by whatever the policy — that’s a state policy, in the case of Florida.\\n\\nPlease, Steve.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You’ve communicated — you’ve communicated regularly with Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you going to try to reach out to him to check on his condition and call him?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I may.\\xa0 But I — look, I just hope he’s doing fine.\\xa0 I mean, I’ve had a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un, and that’s to the benefit of the country.\\xa0 That’s not a bad thing; that’s a good thing.\\xa0 And I’d like to see him be well, and we’ll see how he does.\\n\\nAgain, I don’t know that the reports are true.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And do they have a line of succession, as far as you know?\\xa0 Is —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I — I don’t want to ask him that.\\xa0 I have asked him that, but it’s not — it’s not — it’s not my purpose to tell you that, in all fairness.\\xa0 But, you know, I hope he does well.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I get a follow-up with Dr. Birx for a moment.\\xa0 Dr. Birx, if you don’t mind, I just wanted to follow up on the question we were asking you about, with social distancing in some of these states.\\xa0 So, you know, with Georgia opening back up, you know, things like tattoo parlors, getting a massage, social distancing — maybe there are some creative ways, but it seems very difficult to do social distancing.\\xa0 So, do you have a message for people in Georgia who are soon going to have a choice about going to the hair salon or the nail salon or getting that tattoo if they’re not six feet apart and they’re not able to follow these social distancing guidelines?\\xa0 What’s your message to people in a state like Georgia?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Well, we made it very clear in a message to all of the American people with Opening Up America Again.\\xa0 The criteria that we wanted states to follow, those were careful criteria.\\xa0 There were only six.\\xa0 They were carefully, carefully selected, in conversations with epidemiologists around the world and with CDC, to really pick things that people could understand and use platforms that people have utilized in the past.\\n\\nBut it was built on the premise that it needs to be data-driven and it needs to protect those who are most vulnerable.\\xa0 And then it went through the phases.\\xa0 And the very first thing it says, in all phases, “all individuals need to continue to wash hands, protect the vulnerable, ensure the safety of others.”\\xa0 But in phase one, it made it clear that social distancing was absolutely key.\\xa0 And I think it’s on the White House website.\\xa0 We ask every American to read it and to use that as their guidelines.\\n\\nNow, we’ve also asked governors to create county-level information so that communities can see the information and understand why they may be different than a different county, so that it’s very transparent and understandable.\\n\\nI had a question here a couple of days ago on a Jacksonville Beach.\\xa0 And Jacksonville is dramatically different than Miami.\\xa0 And I think that was reflected in why Jacksonville had a different set of information and regulations.\\n\\nSo I’m not going to second- — you know, judge anyone about their decision-making.\\xa0 What I’m going to say is: We were very clear in what we really believe protects the safety of Americans.\\xa0 And that is clearly laid up — laid out in the Opening Up America Again.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Birx, if I may, I have question, because we got data from Tokyo.\\xa0 An increase of cases and it doubled — of the cases in Singapore.\\xa0 What we’ve been, you know, looking a lot at Europe after China, and then we’re back into this area of the world.\\xa0 Here we’re talking about a plateau and then cases going down.\\xa0 Any lessons to take out of what we — what’s happening in this area, in Asia, after having put our attention somewhere else for so — for so long?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The lesson is to be careful.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’ve got to be very careful.\\xa0 We don’t want that to happen; it could happen.\\xa0 I think we stamp it out if it does happen.\\xa0 We’re not going to be doing any mass closings, I hope.\\xa0 So I think we could.\\xa0 You know, I call them “some burning embers,” and we put them out.\\xa0 And I think we’ve gotten very good at that, but we’ll see.\\xa0 But we don’t want that to happen.\\xa0 No, absolutely.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So are you concerned, Mr. President, once the reopening happen, we won’t need to go back into reclosing?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t want to do that.\\xa0 You don’t want to do that.\\xa0 Nobody in this room wants to do that.\\xa0 You look forward — I think, Bret, very soon, and Jon — sitting next to a lot of your fellow reporters.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 The room seems so empty this way.\\xa0 But it’s one of those things.\\n\\nYeah, go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, thank you.\\xa0 On the topic of public support for your immigration freeze —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 An Ipsos/USA Today poll just came out and found 80 percent of Americans are supportive of the immigration halt — the temporary freeze.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes, I know that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Did that have any — did public support have any effect on your decision making here?\\xa0 And are you surprised by those numbers?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, it’s a high number.\\xa0 I did not see that number.\\xa0 I heard there was a poll.\\xa0 I’m sure there’ll be a lot of polls.\\n\\nNo, look, I think the American people want to make sure that they have jobs for the American people, not for people that come in, in many cases, illegally into our country.\\xa0 So we’re doing that.\\xa0 I don’t know what the numbers are, but I think just common sense tells you that’s where we should be, and that’s where the American people want to be.\\n\\nAnd we’re going to build our country back.\\xa0 And I’m telling you, with all the — the things that we’re doing and infrastructure, which we desperately need, it’s going to be an incredible thing taking place.\\xa0 I think it’s going to be a renaissance.\\xa0 And we’re going to have something that will be — a lot of people going to go to work building those roads and bridges and tunnels and highways and all of the other things we’re going to be building — and broadband for the Middle West.\\n\\nI mean, the farmers haven’t been treated fairly.\\xa0 Let’s face it, the farmers have been treated terribly, when it comes to the Internet.\\xa0 So we’re going to take care of that.\\xa0 We’re going to — we’re going to make them very happy.\\n\\nSo we’ll see you all tomorrow.\\xa0 And we’ll have some interesting things to put out tonight.\\xa0 And I appreciate you being here.\\xa0 And it’s an honor to have Bret Baier here.\\n\\nI’ve used his slot a lot, Jon.\\xa0 I’ve used that slot a lot.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s the only way I could get on, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Huh?\\xa0 It’s — no —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s the only way I could get on.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We want to have you back soon.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\n\\nThank you, everybody.\\n\\nEND\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\n\\n6:56 P.M.

       "  'text': 'THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much everyone.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Following the release of our reopening guidelines, governors across the country are looking forward to phase one and announcing plans for an economic resurgence; we’re going to have a resurgence, too.\\xa0 At a time when millions of American workers and families are struggling with the financial consequences of the virus, it’s critical to continue the medical war while reopening the economy in a safe and responsible fashion.\\n\\nDuring this time, Americans must maintain strict vigilance and continue to practice careful hygiene, social distancing, and the other protective measures that we have outlined and that everybody has become very familiar with.\\n\\nWe continue to be encouraged that many of the areas hardest hit by the virus appear to have turned the corner.\\xa0 For example, recent deaths are down very, very substantially.\\xa0 You can compare that with their peak not so long ago, and you have numbers of 30 percent, 25 percent.\\xa0 In Detroit, as an example, it’s down by over 50 percent.\\xa0 Congratulations.\\xa0 And, in New Orleans, where they’ve done a terrific job, they’re down 65 percent.\\n\\nThirty states have just one case or less per 1,000 people — far fewer cases per capita, as an example, than Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Singapore, Belgium, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden.\\n\\nMy administration continues to press Congress to replenish the enormously successful Paycheck Protection Program, which has impacted 30 million American jobs.\\xa0 We hope to have an agreement very soon.\\xa0 And hopefully tomorrow, the Senate is going to be able to vote.\\xa0 A lot of progress has been made on that — tremendous progress.\\xa0 It’s a great plan.\\xa0 It’s a great plan.\\xa0 It’s helped a lot of people.\\xa0 So we hope to have a vote maybe tomorrow in the Senate.\\n\\nAnd based on the record-low price of oil that you’ve been seeing — it’s at a level that’s very interesting to a lot of people — we’re filling up our National Petroleum Reserves.\\xa0 Strategic — you know, the Strategic Reserves.\\xa0 And we’re looking to put as much as 75 million barrels into the reserves themselves.\\xa0 That would top it out.\\xa0 That would be first time in a long time it’s been topped out.\\xa0 We’d get it for the right price.\\n\\nWe’re also pushing for the deal to include an additional $75 billion — our deal; the deal we’re talking about — $75 billion for hospitals and other healthcare providers.\\xa0 Many providers and their employees have taken a huge financial hit in recent weeks.\\xa0 And visits, elective procedures, surgeries, et cetera, et cetera, were canceled.\\xa0 We think that they can all get back online.\\xa0 They’ll get it done.\\xa0 The hospitals have really been fantastic.\\xa0 The hospitals, they’ve — they’ve stepped up to the plate.\\xa0 They’ve really done a great job.\\xa0 We appreciate it so much.\\n\\nFor areas less affected by the virus, we’ve issued new recommendations about how to safely resume elective treatments.\\xa0 HHS has also distributed the first $30 billion in direct payments to a million healthcare providers across the country.\\xa0 We’ve also invested $1.4 billion in community health centers to ensure our most vulnerable communities, including many African American and Hispanic American communities, have access to the services and testing that they need.\\n\\nEarlier today, Vice President Pence spoke with governors from all 50 states about our unified effort to defeat the virus. \\xa0He had a great call.\\xa0 It was a great call — very positive in, I’d say, every way.\\xa0 Prior to the call, we provided each governor with a list of the names, addresses, and phone numbers of the labs where they can find additional testing capacity within their states — many, many labs.\\xa0 We’re providing you with the list.\\xa0 We’ll show it to you now if you need it.\\xa0 We’ll give you the details.\\xa0 But hundreds and hundreds of labs are ready, willing, and able.\\n\\nSome of the governors, like, as an example, the governor from Maryland didn’t really understand the list.\\xa0 He didn’t understand too much about what was going on.\\xa0 So now I think he’ll be able to do that.\\xa0 It’s pretty simple.\\xa0 But they have tremendous capacity and we hope to be able to help him out.\\xa0 We’ll work with him and work with all of the governors.\\n\\nSimilar to the situation with ventilators, states need to assess their complete inventory of available capacity.\\xa0 Some states have far more capacity than they actually understand.\\xa0 And it is a complex subject, but some of the governors didn’t understand it.\\xa0 The governor, as an example, Pritzker from Illinois did not understand his capacity.\\xa0 Not simply ask the federal government to provide unlimited support — I mean, you have to take the support where you have it, but we are there to stand with the governors and to help the governors, and that’s what we’re doing.\\xa0 And they have a tremendous capacity that we’ve already built up.\\xa0 And you’ll be seeing that; we’re going to be introducing a couple of the folks in a little while to talk about it.\\n\\nI want to draw your attention to Governor Cuomo’s remarks during his press conference today.\\xa0 He said: The President is right.\\xa0 The states’ testing is up to the states to do, which will implement the test and logistically coordinate the tests.\\xa0 We have about 300 labs in New York and they do it.\\xa0 And they’re great labs, actually.\\xa0 And it’s my job to coordinate those 300 labs.\\xa0 I think the President is right when he says that the states should lead.\\n\\nAnd the governor is really — they’re really getting — they’re getting it together in New York.\\xa0 A lot of good things are happening in New York.\\xa0 And I think the governor is going to come in to see us tomorrow.\\xa0 He’s coming to the Oval Office tomorrow afternoon.\\xa0 Andrew is going to be coming in with some of his people.\\xa0 So we look forward to that.\\n\\nThe — some of the articles that just recently came about — if you remember, I put out a statement today.\\xa0 For a month, it was all “ventilator, ventilator, ventilator.”\\xa0 That’s all people could talk about was ventilators.\\xa0 And we did a great job with that.\\xa0 We built a lot of ventilators, to put it mildly.\\xa0 We have so many now that, at some point soon, we’re going to be helping Mexico and Italy and other countries.\\xa0 We’ll be sending them ventilators, which they desperately need.\\xa0 They were a position — they were not in a position to build them themselves.\\n\\nBut we have thousands being built.\\xa0 Every state has had — they have the ventilators.\\xa0 If they don’t, we have almost 10,000 in our Federal Reserve — our “stockpile,” as they call it.\\xa0 And we did a great job with the ventilators.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the press doesn’t cover it — other than the fair press.\\xa0 But — so then you say, “Gee, I — they need ventilators.”\\xa0 We don’t need ventilators.\\xa0 And that’s — that’s under pressure we did that.\\n\\nNobody that needed a ventilator in this country didn’t get one.\\xa0 And a story that just came out: “How the Media Completely Blew the Trump Ventilator Story.”\\xa0 I’m sure you love to see that.\\xa0 That’s by Rich Lowry, a respected journalist and person.\\xa0 “How the Media Completely Blew the Trump Ventilator Story” — which, unfortunately, you did.\\n\\nAnd here’s another one that just came out.\\xa0 Kyle Smith.\\xa0 “The Ventilator Shortage That Wasn’t.”\\xa0 “The Ventilator Shortage That Wasn’t” — because we got it fixed.\\xa0 And we’re also going to help the states, by the way, stockpile ventilators.\\xa0 So if a thing like this should happen again, they’ve got them.\\n\\nThe stories on testing are all over the place — that we’re actually in good shape.\\xa0 I’m going to have the Vice President and others speak to you about that, but we’re in very good shape on testing and we’re getting better all the time.\\xa0 You’re going to see some interesting things.\\n\\nI thought before I went any further though, I’d like to have General Semonite, who has done an incredible job, tell you where we are.\\xa0 You know we’re still building beds and hospitals for people that need them.\\xa0 I guess the hospital business generally is getting pretty much closed out now, but we’re — we’re creating a lot of space for people, just in case.\\xa0 And in some cases, they probably will be using them.\\n\\nBut I thought the general — he’s been so impressive and done such a great job.\\xa0 I thought, on behalf of the services and on behalf of the federal government, he’d say a few words about what we’re doing right now.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\xa0 General.\\n\\nLIEUTENANT GENERAL SEMONITE:\\xa0 Well, thank you, Mr.\\xa0 President.\\xa0 I just want you to know that, on behalf of all of us in the Department of Defense, our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those patients and all those victims that have been affected by this terrible virus.\\n\\nAnd the President of Vice President talk all the time about the heroes, but when I’ve been out there, I’ve seen the doctors, I’ve seen the nurses, and all those that have worked very, very hard, and we’re just — we’re just so proud to be part of this noble calling.\\n\\nI — for my team, I really made it very, very simple.\\xa0 I said there’s three legs of this stool, and they all have “S’s”: There are “sites” — in other words, hospitals; we’ve got to worry about “supplies”; and we’ve got to worry about “staff.”\\n\\nAnd so, right when Governor Cuomo called the President, about almost 30 days ago, he said, “I need some help” — worrying about what could be tens of thousands of hotel room — I mean, of hospital room shortages.\\n\\nSo the President and Secretary of Defense asked us to fly to Albany with a team.\\xa0 And on the way up, we understood how complex of a challenge this was, and we knew there was no way you can solve a complex catastrophe with a complicated solution.\\xa0 We needed a very, very simple solution to be able to then work with HHS, to be able to work with FEMA, to be able to work with the Vice President’s task force, and then to be able to power this down all the way down to the local level.\\n\\nSome of the governors asked us to try to build a hospital in a parking lot or a field in two or three weeks.\\xa0 You can’t physically do that.\\xa0 So what we said was, “Let’s go to where there’s an existing facility.”\\xa0 And I’m going to kind of make this in two big pots: those that are either hotel rooms or college dormitories, smaller rooms — or those that are in real large areas, like field houses or convention centers.\\n\\nAnd we designed those standard facilities that could be either non-COVID or COVID, and then we got that approved here at the federal government to be able to then power that back down.\\n\\nSo we went to Governor Cuomo, and he said, right up front, “I love the concept.\\xa0 I need you in the Javits Center.\\xa0 I’m ready to start having you work tomorrow afternoon.”\\n\\nSo when we flew back that afternoon, the next day, we basically built this standard design and then continued to be able to power it down, all the way down through the rest of the team.\\n\\nSo I just want to show you a couple of slides here.\\xa0 And we’ll — we’ll kind of let you know where we’re at right now, Mr President.\\n\\nWe had to do a bunch of assessments, so somewhere in the order of over 1,100 different locations we went to.\\xa0 And we work for FEMA, and we work for the President, and we work for governors and mayors.\\xa0 And we said, “What do you think your demand is going to be?”\\xa0 And based on a lot of the modeling that’s been in this room here, we were able to understand when the peak curve was, but we also were able to understand where’s the bed shortage.\\n\\nSo then, these 1,100 facilities — right now today, sir, we’re actually executing 32 different facilities.\\xa0 That’s on the order of merit of about 16,000 beds.\\xa0 Eight of those are all done.\\xa0 We’ve still got a lot more to complete.\\xa0 And in the next week and a half, we’re going to complete about 15 more facilities.\\n\\nWe’ve got some pending.\\xa0 Some mayors and governors are still wondering do they have enough bed space.\\xa0 And what’s important here is we need a very agile plan.\\xa0 You can’t do something three weeks ago and think that this is going to continue to stay, because this virus gets a vote.\\xa0 And this entire team — the federal government has tried to be as agile as they can, supporting those states and those governors.\\n\\nThe beauty of the plan, though, was it doesn’t have to be built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.\\xa0 So we designed about an extra 52 facilities.\\xa0 We gave those to the governors. \\xa0And I’ve got to be very, very laudatory to the governors.\\xa0 They then imposed and put a lot of those on the — on the ground and did those themselves.\\n\\nSo let’s go to — I’m just going to show you some real simple pictures here.\\xa0 Go to the next slide, if you don’t mind.\\n\\nSo this is an example of the Javits Center, and you heard the President talk about it quite a few times.\\xa0 This one, about 2,100 bed spaces.\\xa0 What you get is about an 11- or 12-foot-square cubicle.\\xa0 There is lights in there.\\xa0 There’s a nurse call, so if you need to be able to call the nurse station.\\xa0 There are nurse spaces throughout.\\xa0 There’s pharmacies throughout.\\xa0 This one started as non-COVID, but then we came back in and put in central oxygen.\\xa0 So everybody has oxygen right behind their bed to be able to take care of those patients.\\xa0 And again built this one, and about 1,000 patients treated.\\n\\nLet’s go to the next one.\\n\\nI was up in Detroit with Governor Whitmer, and she walked us through and told us her intent.\\xa0 Here’s what — she needed to do this in the TCF Center.\\xa0 You’ll see all the cubicles that are laid out.\\xa0 This is right in the middle of a convention floor where there might be like a boat show or a car show, and then we went in and we built 970 different capabilities there.\\n\\nAnd again, a lot of great work by my guys in the Corps of Engineers and the rest of the mayors in the cities’ team all pulling together.\\n\\nLet’s go to the next one.\\n\\nThis is called the McCormick Place.\\xa0 Governor Pritzker sat us down.\\xa0 He said, “Here’s, kind of, our intent on what you want to do.”\\xa0 Mayor Lightfoot walked us through, and we went into another large convention center.\\xa0 This is actually 3,000 bed spaces.\\xa0 This was a very, very large build. \\xa0And got this one done in a relatively short time.\\n\\nAnd then here’s another one that kind of helps you understand the dynamic here.\\xa0 Go to the next one, please.\\n\\nThis is in Miami Beach, and I flew in to see Governor DeSantis.\\xa0 And my guys had kind of scoped out about 450 beds, and he said, “Todd, how long is it going to take to build this?”\\xa0 And we kind of said, “Probably until the 27th of April.”\\xa0 And he went to his health people and he said, “How long do you need?”\\xa0 And he said, “The day we need this is the 21st of April.”\\xa0 And I told my guys, “You don’t have until the 27th.\\xa0 Figure out how to get it done by the 20th.”\\n\\nThis is where you don’t get to build to be able to have the perfect solution.\\xa0 You got to be able to get the mission essential done.\\xa0 Lives are on the line here, and we’ve got to be able to get everything done to be able to save those lives.\\n\\nAnd let’s go to the last one here.\\xa0 This is one we’re doing right now: Colorado.\\xa0 This is in Denver, in another gigantic convention center.\\xa0 You’ll see all the different cubicles here to be able to just bring in that oxygen.\\xa0 Six-inch copper pipe that comes in, and it’s all piped throughout the entire convention center.\\xa0 Six miles of pipe that’s able to go in to be able to make that happen.\\n\\nAnd in closing, I just want to be able to say that we are very, very focused in the Corps of Engineers on getting this done, but this is all about the team — the federal team, the state team, the local team.\\xa0 The Vice President and his task force, and on a lot of the people sitting here, have informed us of how fast we need to go.\\xa0 And it goes back to, again, all the governors and the mayors to make this happen.\\n\\nBut I want to reiterate: President Trump has called me three times, and Secretary Esper has been on the phone at least one of those times, and said, “What else do we need to do to set you up for success?\\xa0 Is there any other knobs we can turn to be able to help you go?”\\xa0 And you think about that equation of those three “S’s.”\\xa0 I think that with the federal government and the mayors in the cities here, we’ve effectively taken that first “S” out of the equation.\\n\\nAnd, sir, I can’t tell you, of all the things I’ve done in my career, this is a noble calling to be able to step up and save American lives.\\n\\nSo, with that, sir, I thank you very much.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Fantastic job.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Anybody have a question for the general while he’s here?\\xa0 Anybody?\\xa0 Because I think he’s very self-explanatory.\\xa0 He’s done an incredible job.\\n\\nJeff, do you have a question?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are there are there more projects, sir, beyond the ones that you’ve just identified that you’ll be working on?\\n\\nLIEUTENANT GENERAL SEMONITE:\\xa0 So, about a week ago, we thought we were about capped at 26.\\xa0 What we’re seeing is — as I said, the virus gets a vote.\\xa0 We’re seeing some of these curves are stretching out where we might have thought we only had five or six days.\\xa0 We actually have a couple weeks now.\\n\\nOther ones, we’re seeing exactly the opposite.\\xa0 So where we didn’t think there was some — and I’m not going to go into locations here — but we are definitely get requests in.\\xa0 We’ve got six more requests in just in the last four or five days.\\xa0 They’re a little bit smaller facilities and more remote areas, but our job, we still — if we have enough time to go build, we want to get in there, do the assessment.\\xa0 We work for the mayor and the city and the governor here.\\xa0 And we can still get them done if the mayors and those elected officials make a fast enough decision.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You might say, while you’re here, we’re building — the general is in charge of the wall on the southern border, and we want to build 450 miles of wall, and it’s very much under construction.\\xa0 You might give them a little bit of an update: how are we doing with the wall.\\n\\nLIEUTENANT GENERAL SEMONITE:\\xa0 So, sir, I think the most important thing — and you stressed this and Secretary Esper stressed this — there’s really several different priorities here.\\xa0 Our number-one priority in the Department of Defense and the Corps of Engineers is to protect the team, protect the force.\\xa0 No matter what we do, we’ve got to continue to take care of our civilians and our service members out there.\\n\\nAnd so every single thing we’re doing, whether we’re building for the VA, or we’re building for Civil Works projects or for the Department of Defense, or building on the southwest border, we are going out of our way.\\n\\nI talked to my commanders this morning; we’ve got over 4,000 contractors that are on the ground out there, and we’ve had no positives as of this morning, knock on wood.\\xa0 Same thing with my 400 employees.\\xa0 We’re testing them — not necessarily with the more stringent test, but with temperatures — to be able to make sure that everybody is safe and everybody goes out of their way to do things the right way.\\n\\nConstruction is going very, very smooth.\\xa0 What we’re seeing is our contractors are extremely focused.\\xa0 Now that we’ve — we’ve got a good clear path — both on the CBP program, as well as some of the DOD program — we, I think, are very well postured.\\xa0 It’s a very, very aggressive build, but we’re well postured to be able to meet your expectations, sir, of 450 by the end of December 2020.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And we’re over 160 miles.\\n\\nLIEUTENANT GENERAL SEMONITE:\\xa0 A hundred and sixty-four as of today, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 A hundred and sixty-four miles.\\xa0 And we’ll have it done sometime pretty early next year.\\xa0 Very exciting.\\n\\nLIEUTENANT GENERAL SEMONITE:\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And you might just say one thing: the quality of that wall, in terms of its power for stopping people that shouldn’t be coming into our country.\\n\\nLIEUTENANT GENERAL SEMONITE:\\xa0 So, same thing.\\xa0 If you have a standard design that you trust in and it works very well — I’ve got to pat on the back Commissioner Morgan; he was very adamant to continue to be able to make sure that it supports his agents.\\n\\nAnd so we’ve got a design now that certainly does that.\\xa0 And then we’ve got a phenomenal contractor workforce that’s in there, my Corps of Engineer employees.\\xa0 And it’s going in well.\\xa0 We don’t see any significant problems.\\n\\nAnd I think it’s also important to point out that there — we want to do this the right way, so we try to balance this with environmental considerations that are out there.\\xa0 We’re trying to do due diligence when it comes to anything to do with any of the citizens who are affected.\\xa0 We’re trying to make sure that we’re protecting all of the things that we need to protect and try to find that balance where we can both meet the administration’s directive, while at the same time making sure we’re doing this so that everybody gets a vote and everybody has a fair shake.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 Yeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 May I ask what you’re doing regarding the availability of — the recreation sites that the Army Corps of Engineers operates, how the access is going there and whether or not there are restrictions —\\n\\nLIEUTENANT GENERAL SEMONITE:\\xa0 So, I’m an engineer.\\xa0 I take my guidance from some of these experts sitting on the bench over here.\\xa0 And when the President says, “Turn on America,” what we initially did, like many, many other governors — they, you know, shut down beaches, shut down cities — I had a meeting with my commanders this morning, and as soon as we think it’s safe, turn them back on.\\n\\nI mean, parking out there at a rec area where you’re 500 feet away from everybody in a camper is probably low threat.\\xa0 I will continue to take guidance from the administration.\\xa0 But when we get greenlights to continue to put our rec areas full up and let everybody go back out there and do things the safest way — I mean, we work for the administration, so I want to do it safe, but I don’t want to be the last guy that turns things on.\\xa0 Not at all.\\n\\nYes, ma’am.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Hi.\\xa0 Thanks for walking through some of the efforts.\\xa0 Do you have any — can you say anything about whether or not there are any specific efforts in communities that are hardest hit, like black communities or Latino communities, communities of color?\\xa0 Are the Army Corps of Engineers doing anything that would be building any sort of temporary facilities for those communities?\\n\\nLIEUTENANT GENERAL SEMONITE:\\xa0 So we basically key off what the city asked for — the city and the governor.\\xa0 There are a couple specific areas that certain city mayors have asked us for.\\xa0 Again, I’m not going to go into details.\\xa0 But we basically — if they go in and say, “I’m very worried about a hotspot on this side of town, or a specific community here,” we will do — and that’s what the administration has charged to do — is whatever we can do to be most responsive.\\n\\nWe just don’t want ever to have an ambulance pull up to the back of a hospital and somebody says, “We’re out of room.\\xa0 Go to the next hospital down.” \\xa0So that’s where we’re trying to make sure that that bed space is available.\\xa0 And, so far, everything we’ve built has been ahead of need.\\xa0 In other words, we’re able to finish the building two or three days before it’s needed.\\n\\nThank you, ma’am.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 So, General, you have a choice: You can stay and watch — watch these wonderful people ask us really nice questions — or you can go back to building beds.\\n\\nLIEUTENANT GENERAL SEMONITE:\\xa0 Sir, I got a lot of building to do.\\xa0 I’m going to leave, if you don’t mind.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 I had a feeling you were going to say that.\\n\\nLIEUTENANT GENERAL SEMONITE:\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Very impressive.\\xa0 That’s an impressive job, isn’t it?\\xa0 Seriously.\\xa0 That’s really great.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 He’s a terrific gentleman.\\xa0 We have a lot of great people doing that kind of thing that they really have to get recognition for the incredible job they’re doing, because I don’t think anybody else could do it.\\xa0 Nothing like that.\\xa0 And that’s on top of thousands and thousands of hospitals.\\xa0 And, you know, he built — just in New York alone — four hospitals and 2,900 beds, and got them done so quickly.\\xa0 Nobody — nobody saw anything like it.\\n\\nFortunately, we haven’t had to use too many of them, and that’s okay.\\xa0 That’s probably better news than having to use them all, right?\\xa0 Because a lot of good things are happening in New York and elsewhere.\\n\\nSo through the public-private partnerships and deregulation, the federal government has already made immense testing capabilities available, but some states need to take action to fully utilize it.\\xa0 To date, the United States has conducted millions more tests than any other country.\\xa0 You can add them all up and they don’t catch us.\\xa0 And our numbers are doubling almost on a — certainly on a monthly basis, but almost on a weekly basis.\\xa0 We’re moving very rapidly, far — at a number nobody thought possible.\\n\\nAnd we’ll be doubling our number of daily tests if the governors bring their states fully online through the capability that they have.\\xa0 We have tremendous capability out there already existing.\\xa0 And we explained that to the governor today.\\xa0 Mike and all of the people explained it very strongly to the governors.\\xa0 They — they really get it now, I think.\\n\\nAs the experts have explained, this capacity is sufficient to allow states to conduct diagnostic testing to treat patients as well as contact tracing to contain outbreaks and monitoring to pinpoint potential hotspots during phase one.\\n\\nAnd there are some hotspots, and we have them pinpointed, and they can really cover it very, very nicely when they know exactly where to go and they’re being told where to go.\\xa0 And also, these locations where they’re going — and some of them are federal; some of the governors didn’t realize they were allowed to use federal locations.\\xa0 They are.\\n\\nAnd we have a booklet of the federal locations.\\xa0 We can hold it up.\\xa0 I think you’ll show that.\\xa0 Maybe we’ll hold it up now.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 I’ll have the locations.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Okay, fine.\\xa0 But you see the number — thanks. \\xa0Thanks.\\xa0 These are all locations where they can go, which is really pretty amazing.\\xa0 This is just one page out of many.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Over 5,000, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Look.\\xa0 Look at this.\\xa0 This is — these are all locations.\\xa0 (The President displays a document.)\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Five thousand labs.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s a lot of locations. \\xa0And they can all — what is it?\\xa0 Five thousand —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Five thousand pieces of equipment.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So that’s — thank you very much.\\xa0 That’s more than anybody thought, and it’s already there.\\xa0 They have to use it.\\xa0 That’s all.\\xa0 They have to use it.\\xa0 Some weren’t aware; some were very much aware.\\xa0 Some weren’t aware.\\n\\nMy administration also continues to support states with our massive operation to deliver masks, gowns, gloves, and other vital supplies.\\xa0 Admiral Polowczyk and his team at\\xa0FIFA\\xa0[FEMA] are really — what a job they’ve done.\\xa0 And Pete, what a job he’s done.\\xa0 They’re calling on Easter Sunday to make sure everyone is okay.\\xa0 But they’re using detailed data about supply chains to track the deployment of 1 billion pieces of protective equipment through private distributors every two weeks.\\xa0 So what we’re doing is we’re delivering a number that nobody anywhere in the world is delivering.\\n\\nFEMA is working closely with Dr. Birx and the distributors to prioritize supply of resources where they are most needed.\\xa0 We’re finding the location that they have to — they have to get to that location.\\xa0 We have locations that are very important to get to and get to them fast.\\xa0 And that’s where they’re going.\\xa0 So we have a very strong priority.\\n\\nThis pandemic has reaffirmed the importance of keeping vital supply chains at home.\\xa0 We cannot outsource our independence.\\xa0 We cannot be reliant on foreign nations.\\xa0 I’ve been saying this for a long time.\\xa0 If we’ve learned one thing it’s: Let’s do it here, let’s build it here, let’s make it here.\\xa0 We’ve got the greatest country in the world.\\xa0 We’ve got to start bringing our supply chains back.\\n\\nSomebody, years ago, got this crazy idea: Let’s build all over the place and let’s have parts — let’s have a screw for a car delivered and made in a country that’s far away, and let’s have a fender made someplace else, and let’s do this, and let’s do that, and let’s put it all together.\\n\\nAnd I like making it right here in the USA.\\xa0 And I think we’ve learned a lot about that and especially maybe when it comes to pharmaceutical products.\\n\\nWe’ve also conducted major military operations, providing cities and states with additional medical capacity and the incredible 1,800 men and women from the Army Corps of Engineers.\\xa0 You just met with Todd.\\xa0 He’s — the job they’ve done is incredible.\\xa0 But we have nurses, doctors — we have experts in every field, all over.\\n\\nI spoke with Governor Cuomo, I spoke with Mayor de Blasio, I spoke with many of the other governors that I’m both friendly.\\xa0 And — yeah, I think I’m friendly with just about all of them, if you can believe it.\\xa0 But I’ve gotten friendly with a lot of them.\\xa0 I’ve gained a lot of respect for a lot of the governors, both Republican and Democrat, during this process.\\xa0 Some really good people, some really good talent.\\n\\nBut we’re sending a lot of our medical people, not only our construction people like Todd Semonite, but a lot of our medical people are being sent all over the country to different locations: New York City, New York State, New Jersey.\\xa0 I spoke with Phil today.\\xa0 He’s doing a terrific job in New Jersey, but New Jersey got hit very, very hard — Phil Murphy, governor.\\n\\nFrom the day this crisis began, America launched a scientific mobilization of colossal size and scale.\\xa0 Someday they’ll be able to write the true story because nobody has seen anything like it.\\xa0 The fake news just refuses to cover it correctly, but that’s okay.\\xa0 But the people are understanding, and that’s what matters to me.\\n\\nThere are now 72 active trials underway across the United States researching dozens of therapies and treatments, and another 211 are in the planning stages.\\xa0 They’re getting — I mean, they’re literally mobilizing on therapeutics and also on vaccines.\\xa0 A tremendous progress is being made on vaccines and, I must say, on therapeutics.\\n\\nI mean, frankly, if I had my choice: Give me the therapeutics right now, because that would help people right now.\\xa0 And we have some things that I think are working.\\xa0 Not only working, but we have some incredible things that look like they could be an answer.\\xa0 But we’ll know soon.\\xa0 Being tested.\\xa0 Working out right now.\\n\\nThis includes their therapies designed to attack the virus, as well as others that would hinder its replication, reduce the rate of infection, control the immune response, or transfer lifesaving antibodies from the blood of recovered patients.\\n\\nAnd one of the incredible things that we’ve seen — and Mike and I were talking about it before — is the fact oftentimes somebody gets very ill from the plague — okay? — from this horrible scourge.\\xa0 And they get better and they recover, and the first thing they say is, “I want to give my blood.”\\xa0 That’s happened.\\xa0 The doctors have told me it’s happened so much.\\xa0 “I want to give my blood.\\xa0 I want to give my blood.”\\xa0 And they’re doing that.\\n\\nBut tremendous things are happening.\\xa0 You’ll be seeing about — you’ll be seeing that over the weeks.\\xa0 I think we’ll be talking about it in the not-too-distant future.\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson is very well along on vaccines.\\xa0 Again, the vaccines have to be tested.\\xa0 The therapeutics are for now, but a lot of good things are happening on both.\\xa0 But ultimately, we also hope to prevent infection through a safe — a very safe vaccine.\\xa0 And that’ll be a great thing when we have that.\\xa0 And we will have that.\\n\\nSo with that, I’d like to introduce Admiral Giroir and Brad Smith to discuss some of the incredible things that have been done.\\xa0 And we have — they really are — what they’ve been able to do in a very, very short period of time with — and equipment.\\xa0 You’re going to see equipment that you haven’t seen before.\\n\\nAny if you’d just come up, Brad.\\xa0 If you guys would come up, you could give us a little display of some of the equipment that we have and some of the things that are happening, having to do with testing, because “testing” is a big word.\\n\\nRemember, it was all ventilators.\\xa0 And the reason it was all ventilators — they said, “There’s no way he’ll ever be able to catch this one.”\\xa0 And not only did we catch it, we are now the king of ventilators all over the world.\\xa0 We can send them anywhere.\\xa0 We have thousands being made a week.\\xa0 And they’re very high quality.\\xa0 And that’s — it wasn’t playing well, so then they said, “Testing.\\xa0 Testing.\\xa0 Oh, we’ll get him on testing.”\\xa0 Well, testing is much easier than ventilators.\\xa0 Ventilators are big machines that are very complex and are very expensive.\\xa0 You need real — real — you need a group of people that really know what they’re doing.\\xa0 We took auto lines.\\xa0 We took a lot of different people, and now we’ve done that.\\xa0 But it used to be “ventilators, ventilators, ventilators.”\\xa0 Not it’s “testing, testing, testing.”\\n\\nAnd I think the Admiral and I think that Brad will show you some things that you haven’t seen that are, really, very spectacular having to do with testing.\\xa0 We’re way advanced.\\xa0 Way advanced.\\n\\nThe list I showed you — these are places you can go if you’re in the states: 5,000 different machines.\\xa0 Five thousand.\\xa0 They’re all over the country.\\xa0 And we have international also, but these are all over the country.\\xa0 But you’ll see something now that’s really eye-popping in terms of what they’ve done.\\n\\nAnd they’ve done this under great pressure.\\xa0 They’ve come up with things under great pressure that are absolutely amazing.\\n\\nSo, please, if you would.\\xa0 Thank you, fellas.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 Well, thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 I want to talk about a couple things today a little bit different than I’ve spoken about before.\\n\\nSince early March, we’ve really been focusing on two key concepts for testing.\\xa0 Number one: to assure and expand supplies in the U.S. market.\\xa0 This is really critical because we were talking about, really, a cottage industry with very minimal suppliers that we were asking to supply, over a two-week period of time, the normal production that would be for at least a year.\\n\\nAnd as simple as a swab is: A swab is not a swab is not a swab.\\xa0 And we need to be very careful that when we put something in a person and tell them a test result, that it’s really correct.\\n\\nThe second component is to secure sufficient supplies at FEMA during this time of peak disease where we could alleviate any mal-distributions within the state.\\xa0 This is the FEMA process of requesting and sending things out, and also supporting outbreaks.\\n\\nSo, starting many weeks ago — starting in my office many weeks ago, we assembled a multidisciplinary team of really incredible people: the medical side of the equation, which I represent; the laboratory side of the equation; high-tech side of the equation; logistics and operation.\\n\\nAnd Brad Smith is — his day job is Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services — an incredibly important component of our country’s CMS system, building the future healthcare system — but has done a really incredible job operationally and logistically in bringing everyone together.\\n\\nWe have focused on every piece of the supply chain that relates to testing, down to the most minute detail.\\xa0 And he’s going to talk to you about some of that.\\xa0 But that started in the second week of March, was starting an airlift, because the only supplier — the main supplier of swabs at that time was a place in Italy that was completely shut off because of the outbreak in Italy.\\xa0 So Admiral Polowczyk arranged gray-tail Air Force planes to go to Italy to bring millions of swabs back to secure.\\xa0 That’s just how it started, and it’s expanded since then.\\n\\nThe second part is we’ve been really marrying — and this has been the beauty — the logistics and supplies to the overall strategy.\\xa0 Two pieces of strategy: Number one, what is the overall testing strategy?\\xa0 And Dr. Birx has had just an elegant strategy in the past, but even more important in the future, when we make sure we take care of indigent populations and those most vulnerable.\\xa0 So the clinical, the contact tracing, and the monitoring of those who are at most risk.\\n\\nWe’ve also married it to the strategy — and you’ve heard more than you know about — you wanted it to know about it: that a small machine — this point of care — is good for certain things, but it’s not going to test 5,000 people over a short period of time.\\xa0 So the small machines, the medium machines, and the large machines and how to contextualize them.\\n\\nAnd the third thing, before I give it to Brad, which is very important and it’s really critical, is coordinating the research, the epidemiology, and the FDA regulatory process.\\xa0 And why is that so important?\\xa0 When we started five weeks ago, if we wanted to test this many people with the technology we had, we would have used about 80 percent of the Strategic National Stockpile in PPE just to do testing.\\n\\nWe needed an innovation.\\xa0 That innovation was to be able to test out of the anterior nose with a completely different kind of swab.\\xa0 It sounds very mundane, but if you don’t do that, you can’t get the testing to scale.\\xa0 That allowed us to really go to widespread testing last week, moving to polyester swabs, which is going to open up millions of new swabs onto the market.\\xa0 But that’s a regulatory, science, and innovation step that had to co-occur with this.\\n\\nAnd with that, I’m going to let Brad talk about some of the details that he has really shepherded over the past weeks in ways that have truly been amazing and incredibly impressive to me.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thanks, Admiral.\\n\\nMR. SMITH:\\xa0 Well, thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 It’s an honor of a lifetime to be here and serving in this way.\\xa0 I’ve been working under Dr. Birx’s and Admiral Giroir’s leadership over the past several weeks to help increase the supply of testing across the United States.\\n\\nAs you all know, there’s really three parts that you need to make the test work.\\xa0 First, you need the machine — which as Dr. Birx will share more, and the President spoke to, we have a very, very large number of those across the United States.\\xa0 It’s about making sure that we’re taking advantage of them.\\n\\nThe second part of the testing is making sure that we have the collection supplies to actually be able to collect the specimen.\\xa0 And I’ll talk a little bit more about that.\\xa0 And then the third part is making sure that you have the materials you need to support the machine to ensure that you can actually process the test once it gets to the lab.\\xa0 I’ll let Dr. Birx talk more about the machines here in a second.\\n\\nBut as you’ll — as you’ll see across the United States, we have a tremendous number.\\xa0 They range in variety.\\xa0 So we have some very small machines that do point-of-care testing.\\xa0 They may do, say, 50 to 100 tests a day.\\xa0 We also have other very large machines; they can do several thousand — process several thousand tests a day.\\n\\nOn the collection supply piece, I’ll talk through a couple of different kinds of collection that can be done.\\xa0 So for the nucleic acid test, which are the tests that are currently being done today, you generally need a swab of the nose.\\xa0 To do that, you need the swab, you need the collection tube, and you also need the transport media that it can be transported in.\\xa0 We have a large — very large number of swabs already in the country, but we have secured an additional 3 million in production that will be ramping up over the next several weeks.\\n\\nOne company located in the northeast — we’re going to be using Title 3 of the DPA to help them build four new production lines.\\xa0 They are currently the largest swab producer in the country, and this will help them ramp up their production tremendously to over 20 million additional swabs a month.\\n\\nA second company located in Ohio is currently the largest Q-tip maker in the country.\\xa0 We’re helping them convert their line from making Q-tips into making swabs.\\xa0 They are actually ramping up production, starting this week, of swabs, and will be ramping up to over 10 million production — 10 million per month.\\xa0 So, in total, that’s over 30 million new swabs that will be coming just over the next handful of weeks.\\n\\nThe second piece is on the collection tubes.\\xa0 The collection tubes, we’ve been partnering with Oak Ridge National Lab, a Department of Energy lab based in Tennessee.\\xa0 They have very unique and sophisticated injection molding manufacturing capability, and they are in the process of ramping that up to create collection tubes, and they will be ramping up to over 40 million collection tubes a month here over the next several weeks.\\n\\nIn addition to the swabs, we believe that as testing progresses, there’ll be other types of testing, like serological testing that will occur.\\xa0 And those samples have to be collected in different ways.\\xa0 So, many times, some of those tests will require a finger prick.\\xa0 So, in addition, we’ve secured over 17 million lancets, which is what you use for the finger prick, so that we have those available, as well as 17 million alcohol swabs, which is what you need to clean the finger before you do the finger prick.\\n\\nIn addition, although folks are not talking about this much yet, we also believe that businesses across the country may want thermometers to test folks as they come into the office, and so we’ve secured over 650,000 infrared thermometers that states and businesses will be able to access, to be able to test folks as they come into work.\\xa0 So I think we’ve made tremendous progress on the collection side.\\n\\nIn addition to the collection side, we’ve been very focused on ensuring that the labs have what they need.\\xa0 To process a specimen in a lab, you really need two things: You need something called an extraction kit, and you need something called a PCR test.\\xa0 In order to be able to fully process a test, you need both of these things.\\xa0 Sometimes these things come together, and sometimes they come separate.\\n\\nFor some of our point-of-care tests, including the Abbott and Cepheid tests, they come together.\\xa0 They are ramping up production rapidly to over 3 million of those tests per month.\\xa0 And these are tests that did not exist even a month ago.\\n\\nThe second piece is on some of these large machines.\\xa0 They also sell complex cartridges that come together.\\xa0 One of the big manufacturers has already ramped up production from about 1.6 million a month to more than twice that already.\\xa0 And that’s already occurred.\\n\\nIn addition to when they come together, they also sometimes come separate, and we see significant ramping up of production there from our manufacturers through our public-private partnerships.\\xa0 And we’re seeing both several million more over the next few weeks of both the RNA extraction kit, as well as the PCR test kit.\\n\\nSo with that, thank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Mike, please.\\xa0 Thank you, Brad.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 And I share your admiration for this remarkable team — from the Army Corps of Engineers, to Brad, to Admiral Giroir.\\xa0 They’re doing a remarkable job every day.\\n\\nAs the President mentioned, today we had our weekly conference call with governors across the country — states and territories.\\xa0 And I was able to convey to them our appreciation for the leadership that every governor of every state and territory has provided.\\n\\nThanks to their leadership, thanks to the extraordinary cooperation of the American people — despite the fact that more than 770,000 Americans have contracted the coronavirus, and our hearts grieve for the more than 41,000 Americans who’ve lost their life — the truth is that, as we stand here today, we are slowing the spread.\\xa0 And as the President reflected, we continue to see steady progress in less cases, lower hospitalizations, even in hotspots around the country.\\xa0 And we commended America’s governors for their efforts in that regard.\\n\\nWe are preserving our healthcare capacity, as the General with the Army Corps of Engineers reflected.\\xa0 At the President’s direction, we’ve built a great number of hospitals around the country, but the utilization rate has been fairly low because of the mitigation efforts, the cooperation of the American people, and we have not had to use them.\\xa0 And that, as the President said, is very good news.\\n\\nIn a word, we thank the governors across country for taking actions — decisive action to save lives and to make a difference.\\xa0 I reminded them that we’re all in this together, that we have one mission, and we’re one team.\\n\\nAnd we spoke on the conference call about last week’s Guidelines to Open Up America Again.\\xa0 And we heard from governors across the country about the progress that they were making.\\xa0 We spoke to governors from New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and Michigan about their ongoing efforts at social distancing and addressed questions that they had about needs that have been spoken up already in this — in this presentation today.\\n\\nIn addition, as we promised last week when we spoke to governors on Thursday about the guidelines to open up America, our team presented every governor in the country, states and territories, with a memorandum detailing laboratory capacity and all locations of laboratory equipment for diagnostic tests that can perform the coronavirus test.\\n\\nWe also provided, as Dr. Birx will elaborate in just a few moments, literally a map about where these — these testing devices are located.\\xa0 And I must tell you, Mr. President, I was very impressed at the way governors, as we speak, are scaling testing in their own states using these resources.\\n\\nOur hope is that by providing this information, and by our team that we’ve enlisted out of Walter Reed that’s contacting every one of the laboratories in the country to find out what their needs are and to encourage them to activate those testing machines to do coronavirus testing, that we’ll continue to be able to support a state-managed effort to increase testing even more.\\n\\nBut a few highlights: Governor Doug Ducey announced antibody testing for 250,000 health professionals this week and first responders — a partnership between the state and the University of Arizona.\\n\\nWe spoke today about Governor Gavin Newsom’s announcement that he set up a task force for testing at five to seven high-capacity testing hubs, in partnership with UC San Diego and UC Davis, to increase testing in high-capacity labs around the state of California.\\n\\nWe heard from Governor Ron DeSantis, Mr. President, about — about the efforts of the state of Florida.\\xa0 I believe he said that, at this time, Florida had conducted 275,000 coronavirus tests, and they are in the process of a major expansion of statewide testing, with the goal of opening up additional sites and using the Florida National Guard to test residents at nursing homes and long-term care facilities in Florida.\\n\\nWe also recommend — recommended, today, to every governor’s attention the public health website that the state of Florida established, which has useful information on a county-by-county level about where testing is happening.\\n\\nMr. President, as you said, governors are utilizing testing assets.\\xa0 They’re managing and deploying these resources as they see fit.\\xa0 And at your direction, we’re going to continue to work very closely with them.\\n\\nOther governors that we spoke with included Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.\\xa0 There are 13 new or expanded coronavirus drive-through testing sites in Michigan that her team has stood up with the Michigan Primary Care Association.\\xa0 And we — and we assured her that we would continue to work, as Brad and Admiral Giroir are literally working around the clock, to make sure that they have the supplies to support all of that testing.\\n\\nAs the President said, Governor Hogan — who always begins our conference calls as he’s chairman of the National Governors Association — expressed appreciation for last week’s Guidelines to Open America Up Again and his appreciation, on behalf of all the governors, for the list of laboratories in each individual state.\\n\\nHe did raise the issue that we had included on the list Department of Defense facilities that have laboratories and machines, and also other federal facilities, many of which are in Maryland.\\xa0 And I was able to assure Governor Hogan and every governor on the call that we will make all of those laboratories available across the country, to every state, as the need for testing capacity continues to scale.\\n\\nAnd so this is one more step where you see the Army Corps of Engineers; where you literally see thousands of military doctors and nurses on the streets of New York and other cities around the country.\\xa0 This is one more step where we, literally, as the President said from early on, are leaving no stone unturned, and we are delivering a whole-of-government approach for our states as they — as they deal with the coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\nGovernors are continuing to expand testing, and we assured them that we’re going to continue to work in every way to support their efforts to do just that.\\n\\nAnd I will say again, as we’ve said before, as Dr. Birx comes up to explain to you what we delivered to the governors today: We told the governors once again, today, that by our best estimates, we have enough testing capacity today for every state in America to go to phase one if they meet the other criteria of 14 days of reduced cases and sufficient hospital capacity to prepare for any eventuality that may occur.\\xa0 Once again, we have enough testing capacity for every state in America to go to phase one.\\n\\nBut we assured the governors today that we’re going to continue to work around the clock to expand the testing capacity, support supplies, and to support their efforts to encourage social distancing and the very mitigation efforts that the American people have been doing that have brought us the progress that we see all across the country today.\\n\\nWith that, Mr. President, I’ll just let Dr. Birx describe what we distributed today.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mike.\\xa0 Deborah?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President and Mr. President.\\xa0 I just want to show you a couple of additional slides, but also to remind all of Americans that we still have a significant number of cases, both in the Boston area and across Massachusetts and Chicago.\\xa0 To really — that our hearts go out to those cities as they continue to struggle with coronavirus and the consequences at the hospitalization — to all the healthcare providers that are on the frontline.\\n\\nWe wanted — so these are just an illustration of the different types of equipment that are out there, describing them both as low speed but quick turnaround time, to high speed and taking three to four hours to actually run 100 or more tests.\\n\\nAnd so the equipment range from those different — and that’s why there’s 5,000 of them, as noted by the President in this list.\\n\\nWe wanted every governor and every state and health laboratory director to have a clear understanding of the full capacity within the state — both for the capacity, but also where technical assistance and additional supplies may be available.\\xa0 And we were proud to put the federal labs on that list because the military and the VA have stepped up every step of the way to provide support both in testing and care.\\xa0 We have many military members on the frontlines, and I’m sure the military would offer their facilities to the governor of Maryland or any governor who wanted to utilize those to expand testing.\\n\\nSo the next slide — I’m just going to run through them very quickly.\\xa0 So every governor not only received the Excel spreadsheet with the complete list of the equipment and the ZIP Code of the location and the laboratory to really be able to create a mosaic of laboratories of the high-speed and low-speed equipment together to meet the needs of their clients, depending if they’re drive-through or hospital needs.\\n\\nSo this is what Florida looks like.\\xa0 Next slide.\\xa0 This is what Louisiana looks like.\\xa0 Next slide.\\xa0 Maryland, with significant capacity.\\xa0 Next slide.\\xa0 Virginia, with significant capacity throughout the state.\\xa0 Next slide.\\xa0 New York — obviously a lot of capacity in New York City, with overlapping capacity.\\xa0 It’s important to know where this is, because then hospitals and labs can support each other when they need surge capacity.\\xa0 Next slide.\\xa0 This is New Jersey.\\xa0 Next slide.\\xa0 Pennsylvania.\\xa0 Next slide.\\xa0 Massachusetts.\\xa0 Next slide.\\xa0 Ohio.\\xa0 Next slide.\\xa0 Oklahoma.\\xa0 Next slide.\\xa0 Washington.\\xa0 Next slide.\\xa0 I think that’s Wyoming.\\n\\nSo we wanted to show, both in states that have large populations and in states that have lower populations.\\xa0 You can see that, in general, the number of machines match their population.\\n\\nAnd we’re working with the Walter Reed group and the American Society of Microbiologists and all the lab directors to really create a web of understanding of what the capacity is currently, what the capacity can be, and how the federal government can support them in developing their strategies linked to the overarching federal strategy of testing, as outlined in our guidelines.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 That was great.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A question for Dr. Birx, please.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Birx, the University of Southern California and the L.A. County Public Health put out a report today that suggests that the penetrance of the virus is as much as almost 40 times what it was believed to be; that as many as 442,000 people in L.A. County may have been infected, which suggests two things.\\xa0 It suggests that you have a lot more people out there who would be spreading the virus, but it also suggests that the case fatality rate is more in line with the 2017-2018 flu than what we’ve seen in some other areas of the world.\\xa0 But I’m wondering if you’ve seen that and what your thoughts were.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So we’re looking at all those studies very carefully.\\xa0 And I think you will remember, over the last three weeks, I’ve been talking about the level of asymptomatic spread and my concern about asymptomatic spread.\\xa0 Because with flu and other diseases, when people are sick, it’s easy to contact trace.\\xa0 When people are not sick and shedding virus, you have to have a very different approach — a very different sentinel surveillance approach, a sentinel monitoring approach, which we outlined in the guidelines.\\xa0 And it’s why the guidelines took that very seriously.\\xa0 We knew that was unique for respiratory diseases, but it was because we were very concerned about the level of asymptomatic.\\n\\nAnd, if you remember, we used to — we talked about younger age groups may have more asymptomatic disease, and your asymptomatic disease may decrease with your older age groups, and that your symptomatic disease might increase with — with age groups.\\xa0 This is still our working hypothesis.\\xa0 We have no data right now, still, to support that.\\xa0 But it’s these kinds of studies that help that.\\xa0 We know that New York and Detroit and other cities are very interested, which we want to also support them in — testing for frontline responders, first responders, and healthcare workers because we think their exposure may have been the greatest.\\n\\nWhat we don’t want to do — and I’m just going to do another 30 seconds on testing.\\xa0 These tests are not 100 percent sensitive or specific.\\xa0 And I’m going to go over this over and over again.\\xa0 So if you have 1 percent of your population infected, and you have a test that’s only 99 percent specific, that means that when you find a positive, 50 percent of the time it will be a real positive and 50 percent of the time it won’t be.\\n\\nAnd that’s why we’re really asking people to start testing in among the first responders and the healthcare workers that have had the greatest exposure, because that’s where the test will be most reliable.\\xa0 And then, when we have the luxury, we can go out to broader and broader communities.\\xa0 But this has been the fundamental question to begin with and has been persistent.\\n\\nAnd we will emphasize to the American people again: This is a highly contagious virus.\\xa0 And we don’t know, by looking at someone, whether they have preexisting conditions or not.\\xa0 And so all of us, as far as protecting others, must continue to do all of the recommendations to ensure that when we are in an asymptomatic state, we’re not passing the virus to others.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I have a question for you as well. \\xa0The governor of South Carolina announced today they’re going to open some stores with restrictions.\\xa0 But they just told my colleague, Natasha Chen, that they have not achieved that criteria in the White House Guidelines about the downward trajectory for 14 days.\\xa0 So shouldn’t they not be reopening stores today?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 We have asked every governor to follow the guidelines, just as we’ve asked every American to follow the guidelines put out by the President.\\xa0 But each of the governors can decide for themselves whether they’ve reached specific guidelines in specific areas.\\n\\nI had a question, I think, on Saturday about Jacksonville and their beaches.\\xa0 So I did spend about five hours going to every state website, and I will tell you that the — Florida’s Department of Health website is extraordinary.\\xa0 And this is what every department of health should have.\\xa0 Because when you go to that website, you can see that most of the cases are in southern Florida — in the Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Broward County area.\\xa0 And if you look in Jacksonville, they had less than 20 cases per day and less than 800 in four weeks.\\n\\nAnd so these are the kinds — when you inform the public and give them the information that they need, then they can make decisions along with the local government and governors.\\n\\nSo I’m not going to say specifically with South Carolina because I don’t know their specific website right now, and I don’t talk about data unless I’ve seen it myself.\\xa0 But I know from Jacksonville that they had less than 20 cases a day.\\n\\nAnd so this is how we need to start informing the community.\\xa0 These websites are critical.\\xa0 It’s by ZIP Code and it’s by county.\\xa0 They can see cases, they can see cumulative cases, they can see new cases, they can see hospitalizations, they can see mortality, they can see age groups of mortality, and they can see where every testing piece is.\\n\\nThis is how we have to inform the American public, and this is where the American public will develop confidence in each of their counties and local governments.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Birx, I was hoping you can comment — the Vice President mentioned that there’s enough testing capacity right now to proceed to phase one.\\xa0 But what about phase two or phase three?\\xa0 Is there — are there enough machines or enough cartridges, are there enough regents right now for this sort of reopening the administration is envisioning taking place over the next month or two?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So you can see the current machine outline.\\xa0 And you can see that both of these gentlemen have par- — prepared to have everything ready for phase two, and preparing it now for what we will need in the future.\\xa0 And I think that’s what you saw with the ventilators.\\xa0 That’s what you’re seeing with PPE.\\xa0 It’s not just for today, it’s for tomorrow.\\xa0 And as our federal planning is not just for this instant — it’s making sure that we meet the needs of this instance, but we’re planning for 30 and 60 and 90 days ahead.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Admiral, go ahead on that one, if you’d like.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 I — I would just agree with Dr. Birx completely.\\xa0 We are ready right now to enter phase one.\\xa0 And we are ramping up all our capabilities across the board, not just to achieve what’s necessary for phase two, but two x, three x, four x, so that we will be absolutely over prepared when the nation is ready to go into those phases.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 President Trump?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: And, by the way, not everybody agrees that we have to do that much testing.\\xa0 We’re going maximum.\\xa0 You understand.\\xa0 There’s some people that don’t want to do that much testing, but we’re going maximum.\\xa0 We’re going to the outer limits.\\xa0 And I think that’s the way, probably, it should be.\\n\\nJeff, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, to return to a topic that you opened the press conference with on oil: U.S. crude futures today went below zero, went into negative territory.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It went negative.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Like interest rates, they go negative.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Does that make you want to see Saudi Arabia and Russia and OPEC Plus do more to reduce supply?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it’s for short term.\\xa0 Much of it has to do with short sellers, much of it has to do — if you look a month into the future, I think it’s at $25 or $28 a barrel.\\xa0 So a lot of people got caught.\\xa0 They got caught.\\xa0 And there are a lot of people that are not too happy because they got caught.\\n\\nSo if you take a look at it, you’ll see it’s more of a financial thing than an oil situation, but — because you take, I believe, in a month or so — in other words, go a little bit out, it’s at $25 and $28 a barrel.\\xa0 So it’s largely a financial squeeze, and they did get squeezed.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So would you like to see, however, Saudi Arabia and other countries make more cuts?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’ve already done that, where Saudi Arabia is cutting back, Russia is cutting back, Mexico is cutting back, and the OPEC Plus — they call it OPEC, plus additional states — are cutting back.\\n\\nAnd you know, the problem is nobody is driving the car anywhere in the world — essentially, 184 nations.\\xa0 Factories are closed and businesses are closed.\\xa0 And so, all of a sudden — we had really a lot of energy to start off with, oil in particular.\\xa0 We had a lot.\\xa0 And then, all of a sudden, they lost 40, 50 percent of their markets.\\xa0 So it just stopped.\\n\\nSo it’s going to be picking up, and the energy business will be strong.\\xa0 But they cut back.\\xa0 It could be 20 million barrels, but it’s, let’s say, 15.\\xa0 That was between Russia and Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nBut this had to do with the squeeze, and it was a very tough squeeze.\\xa0 A lot of people got —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You don’t think they need to do more right now?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they got to do more by the market, to be honest.\\xa0 Look, same thing over here.\\xa0 If the market is the way it is, people are going to slow it down or they’re going to stop.\\xa0 That’s going to be automatic, and that’s happening.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I — on criminal justice reform and these SBA loans: I got an email earlier this morning from a fella in the northwest who owns a supply business.\\xa0 And he has a felony on his record — non-violent felony — in the past five years, which under SBA guidelines makes him ineligible for one of these PPP loans.\\xa0 So he has now had to let go 50 employees, many of whom are criminals trying to get back into society.\\n\\nI don’t believe there’s anything in the CARES Act that would restrict somebody —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 If you give me the name of the company and his name, I’ll have that checked out, John.\\xa0 I’ll do that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s a friend of yours?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No, not a friend of mine.\\xa0 No.\\xa0 Just somebody who contacted me out of the blue.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Why did he call you?\\xa0 He called you to say he’s a criminal and why did he get a loan?\\xa0 Or what — what’s —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Because he says he wanted to apply for an SBA loan and couldn’t, and wondered how that squared —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 If you give me the —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — with your drive to criminal reform.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — name, I’ll look into it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’d like to look into that, okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I have a question —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Kaitlan, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — on reopening of the country.\\xa0 If these companies that open, and they have employees come back to work and they get sick, will these companies be liable?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Which companies are you talking about?\\xa0 Under what?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Any companies that open.\\xa0 Manufacturing — any kind of company that opens and employees go back to work —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So we have —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and they get sick, will the company be liable?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’ll give you an answer to that.\\xa0 I’ll give you a legal answer to that when we look it up.\\xa0 But we have tried to take liability away from these companies.\\xa0 We just don’t want that because we want the companies to open and to open strong.\\n\\nBut I’ll get you a legal opinion on that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Who would be liable?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’ll get you — well, that’s what I’m saying.\\xa0 I’ll get you a legal opinion on it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You — you guys haven’t discussed that yet?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Nobody has discussed it, no.\\xa0 But we will now.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have any business executives voiced concern to you about being liable, potentially?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Not one.\\xa0 Not one.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 They didn’t say it —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Not at this point.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — on the call last week?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But we’re going to look, because they have talked about general liability.\\xa0 So I’ll get you a specific answer from the lawyers.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thanks, Mr. President.\\xa0 I want to follow on oil.\\xa0 When you were talking earlier, you were talking about the PPP deal, and then mentioned the SPR in the first stimulus package, even though you had announced that —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, I’ll bet you know the price of oil right now, don’t you?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I do.\\xa0 Do you know the price of oil?\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I do.\\xa0 I actually do.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s negative 37 dollars.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Of course, nobody has ever heard of negative oil before, but it’s for a short term.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 In your opening remarks, you were talking about the PPP deal, and then you mentioned the 75 million barrels of oil that —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — you previously had said you wanted to purchase.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You weren’t able to get funding for that in the first deal.\\xa0 So I’m wondering, are you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, at the price you’re talking about, you don’t need funding.\\xa0 They pay you.\\xa0 See?\\xa0 You know? Because right now —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You could if you can go get it in the next 24 hours —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, if you can get it.\\xa0 That’s true.\\xa0 If you can get it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So my question — my first question is: Are you asking for that funding as —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, at a minimum, we’ll let —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — part of the PPP deal?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — people store.\\xa0 So we’ll store it.\\xa0 We’ll use it as storage and charge for it.\\xa0 But people need storage desperately, and we have massive storage under the petroleum —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you’re not going to make it a requirement of the PPP interim funding deal?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s not a question of requirement.\\xa0 If we could buy it for nothing, we’re going to take everything we can get.\\xa0 The only thing I like better than that is where they pay you to take the oil, but that’s a short-term squeeze.\\xa0 You understand that.\\xa0 So it’s — I don’t think you’re going to see that.\\n\\nBut, no, we’d like to have Congress — this is a great time to buy oil.\\xa0 And we’d like to have Congress approve it so that we could — instead of just storing it for the big — usually the big companies.\\xa0 Because I think we have 75 million gallons right now, capacity.\\xa0 That’s a lot.\\xa0 It’s — we’ve been building it up over a period of time, but that’s a lot: 75 million barrels.\\n\\nSo we’re going to get — either ask for permission to buy it, or we’ll store it.\\xa0 One way or the other, it will be full.\\n\\nOkay, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And then, Mr. President — oh, sorry.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, go ahead.\\xa0 You — you can finish up.\\xa0 We’ll go right to you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, some senators, including Senator Cramer, have called on you to stop Saudi oil shipments that are on the way right now.\\xa0 Is that — you can do that under Section 232.\\xa0 Is that something that you would consider?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0Well, we’ll look at it.\\xa0 I heard just as I’m walking into the room.\\xa0 We certainly have plenty of oil.\\xa0 So I’ll take a look at that.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nYes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Two questions: First, on testing.\\xa0 The second on the SBA loan program.\\xa0 When will you — or will you, in fact, invoke the DPA to force that company you mentioned to ramp up production of cotton swabs?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we don’t — we really don’t need it.\\xa0 We use it.\\xa0 We go up.\\xa0 And I’ve used it a lot.\\xa0 But we use it and then sometimes all they have to do is see it coming.\\n\\nDo you want to talk about that, Admiral?\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 I think this is — I don’t think any of us knew very much about the DPA, but there’s sort of a force side of the DPA where you force a company to do something.\\xa0 But there’s a second side of it which is really a hand up.\\n\\nThe company we’re talking about have done — has done everything to support this effort and have ramped up production.\\xa0 I’m on the phone with them multiple times a day.\\xa0 This is the hand up.\\xa0 This is the government coming in and saying, “How can we help you expand your lines?”\\xa0 There’s no asynchrony here at all.\\n\\nSo this is the hand-up side of the DPA, which is exactly what these small American heroic companies need.\\xa0 They don’t need to be forced.\\xa0 They’re all in.\\xa0 Their employees are all in.\\n\\nMR. SMITH:\\xa0 So a point of clarity, because —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And we don’t want to embarrass people either.\\n\\nPlease, Brad.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nMR. SMITH:\\xa0 So today, we were on site — or there were folks on site with that company, finishing out what their capital projections will be in order to be able to ramp up these additional four lines that I spoke about.\\xa0 The company will then turn in a white paper to the DOD that will then help move the process forward.\\xa0 But it’s actively in process.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And I fully understand that the need is enormous, but on March 24th — March 21st, the administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March.\\xa0 So far, roughly 4 million people have been tested.\\xa0 So where are the other 23 million or so tests?\\xa0 Did they not materialize?\\xa0 Are they in the pipeline?\\xa0 Help us understand that discrepancy.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 So, since I was the one who said that, let me explain where we are — where we were.\\xa0 So I was getting my information — it was correct information — about the actual tests that are in the marketplace.\\xa0 So if you want to use those metrics, there’s been over 40 million, quote, “in the marketplace.”\\xa0 But we have an end-to-end issue that we needed to deal with, and that’s what we’ve been dealing with: the swabs, the transport media.\\n\\nIf we don’t have people utilizing the machines the way Dr. Birx is talking about — we have some of our main platforms that are only 10 percent being utilized.\\xa0 You can have a lot of — you could have a lot of tests in the market, and those are correct numbers, but if the machines aren’t utilizing them and they’re not organized at that level, then they’re not being –they’re not being utilized to its fullest.\\xa0 And that —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So, Admiral, you meant if the machines were utilized, that would be the number.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 You would — you would have a lot of those millions of tests already being done.\\xa0 I think Ambassador Birx has estimated that we have another million tests a week, just on one platform, that could be — that could be done if the machines were utilized more fully.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I have a question for Admiral Giroir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 For this?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 For Admiral Giroir.\\xa0 You say that there are — and the Vice President has said this and Mr. Smith said it — that there will be enough tests in place for phase one.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 There are.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There are?\\xa0 The question is: What’s the standard of testing that you now have the capability for?\\xa0 Is it to test people who are only very ill?\\xa0 Is it test people who have the sniffles?\\xa0 Is it test people who come in just because they want to get a test?\\xa0 I mean, what is the standard here for the testing?\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 It is the guidelines, but I tried to be a little specific about this on Friday, and we all tried to.\\n\\nNumber one is, you need to test everyone who’s symptomatic, right?\\xa0 And you need to over test them, because —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How — how symptomatic?\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 We’re talking any symptoms that would be consistent with COVID, right?\\xa0 So — and there’s a wide range of symptoms.\\xa0 You want to test them and you want to over test.\\xa0 And we talked about the approximate metric with Ambassador Birx — fully supports — because we — you know, this is a good metric that you want to get about one positive for every 10 tests.\\xa0 Then you know you oversample.\\n\\nSecond — and this a really important part of the strategy — is because so many people are asymptomatic, there is no way that you can test enough people to pull one asymptomatic out of 300 people in the population.\\n\\nSo the strategy with — Ambassador Birx offered — and, you know, I talk to epidemiologists around the country, and they go, “Wow, I wish I would have thought of that” — is to really focus on the vulnerable population where we know that the asymptomatic rate could be much higher than the rest of the population.\\xa0 And we are going to be focus- — and this is what my office does in during normal — normal times — focusing on the underserved populations, particularly in inner cities and urban areas.\\xa0 They have a higher rate because overcrowding, they can’t telework, they’re subject to a lot of comorbid conditions.\\xa0 Nursing homes: We all know about nursing homes, and there is both symptomatic and asymptomatic spread.\\xa0 And finally, some of our indigenous populations in the Indian Health Service.\\n\\nSo this is a very, very important layer that most of the models and people don’t talk about, because that’s where we’re going to pick up the asymptomatic carriage.\\xa0 And when you do that, that’s when you focus on track and trace.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So just a quick follow-up on that.\\xa0 If we have enough tests right now for everyone to go into phase one, why is the governor of Maryland having to get half a million tests from South Korea?\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 I don’t know what the governor of Maryland is doing in South Korea, but there is excess capacity every day.\\xa0 If he wanted to send 30- or 40,000 tests to LabCorp and Quest, that — that could be done.\\xa0 That could be done tomorrow.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But he was saying they didn’t have enough that they needed to start to up their testing capacity and make it adequate.\\xa0 So they had to have these late-night meetings —\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 I think — I think we’re seeing all across the country —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — with South Korea.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 — that in the states that have been hardest hit, their capacity — not only their capacity, their testing far — far exceeds South Korea.\\xa0 And they’ve been able to do that on a relatively straightforward basis.\\xa0 I don’t know what the governor of Maryland — we talked to him today.\\xa0 He didn’t bring that up today.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Haven’t you spoke to him about this?\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 We were on the governors’ call today.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But you haven’t spoken to him, like, personally on this?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, Mike.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We spoke to Governor Hogan today.\\xa0 I’ll follow up, because I heard there was an announcement today about that he had acquired some tests from overseas.\\n\\nMaybe we could put the slide back up that showed the number of facilities, just in the state of Maryland.\\n\\nAnd part of our process — and I don’t know when the governor placed the order from South Korea.\\xa0 Wouldn’t — I wouldn’t begrudge him or his health officials for ordering tests.\\xa0 But the capacity of all the different laboratories and the number of machines that are across Maryland was part of what we were communicating today, including federal facilities.\\xa0 NIH is in Maryland.\\xa0 There’s Department of Defense facilities.\\n\\nAnd what we assured the governor then, and we assured all the governors, is that we’ll open up all of those facilities.\\n\\nBut, John, back to your — your point: There was one other element of that; that’s the phase one testing.\\xa0 And I can’t — I can’t really describe it as well as the doctors here.\\xa0 But it’s the contact tracing piece.\\xa0 We really believe that states that meet the criteria of 14 days of cases going down and proper hospital capacity, if they test people that have symptoms, and if they deploy resources to vulnerable populations — nursing homes and other designated vulnerable populations where we believe the threat of serious outcomes from the coronavirus is real, then we also, today, informed the governors that we will be deploying CDC teams to every state and every territory in the country to assist them in contact tracing.\\n\\nGovernor Jared Polis raised a very good point about the legislation the President is currently negotiating on Capitol Hill.\\xa0 He recommended that we make sure that the new bill, that has some $25 billion in testing resources, also cover contact tracing expenses by states.\\xa0 We assured him our administration strongly supports that.\\xa0 We communicated that to the Secretary of the Treasury and the rest of our negotiation team, and we’ll be pursuing that.\\n\\nBut we were able to tell every one of the governors that we will be deploying teams, we think of 10 or 12, for a start, from CDC to reside in all of our states and territories to supervise and work with contractors and others to do the kind of contact tracing.\\n\\nSo it’s: Test people that don’t feel well and may have the coronavirus.\\xa0 Keep a careful eye and monitor your vulnerable population.\\xa0 And when you come across a case, have a team on the ground that can do the immediate contact tracing and testing.\\xa0 And that’s how we — that’s how we restrain and contain the spread of the coronavirus during phase one.\\xa0 And, frankly, it’s the beginning of the structure for how we contain the coronavirus going forward.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And take a look at that map.\\xa0 The governor of Maryland could’ve called Mike Pence, could’ve saved a lot of money.\\xa0 Look at all of the — look at these different places.\\xa0 And that’s Maryland, right there.\\xa0 So, could’ve saved a lot of money, but that’s okay.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you’re saying he didn’t need to go to South Korea for those testing kits?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I don’t think he needed to go to South Korea.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have you guys not spoken to him about this?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think he needed to get a little knowledge, would’ve been helpful.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, on the SBA loans, do you think it’s right that major corporations, major institutions — like the Ritz restaurant chain, like Harvard University — apparently got a lot of money under the CARES Act, money that was supposed to be earmarked for small-business owners.\\xa0 Do you think that’s fair?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I know one thing: I didn’t get any. That’s for sure.\\xa0 I didn’t get any.\\xa0 We’ll look at individual things, and some people will have to return it if we think it’s inappropriate.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But should the criteria be changed so that that money goes to people who need it the most?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it’s being done by great professionals.\\xa0 It’s being done by banks and, as you know, community banks all over the country.\\xa0 They’re — that’s what they do.\\xa0 They loan money, and they’re supposed to do it according to not only criteria, but according to what we think is right.\\xa0 But if somebody got something that we think is inappropriate, we’ll get it back.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 Good — good point.\\n\\nPlease. Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 Another — a different question about South Korea.\\xa0 There are reports that you are personally negotiating with President Moon the terms of reduction of U.S. forces on the Korean Peninsula, and that there are four scenarios involved.\\xa0 Can you confirm that?\\xa0 And, if so, what is your desired outcome?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think that South Korea — I had a great talk with President Moon.\\xa0 He’s a friend of mine.\\xa0 I congratulated — he had a wonderful election victory.\\xa0 I was very happy about that.\\xa0 He was — as you know, just recently.\\n\\nNo, we are negotiating for President Moon and for South Korea to help us monetarily, because we — as you know, we have 32,000 soldiers there.\\xa0 That varies from 28- to 32,000 in South Korea.\\xa0 And we think that, before I came aboard, they paid very little, if anything.\\xa0 So we’re defending a wonderful nation — a nation that we have great relationships, but we’re asking them to pay for a big percentage of what we’re doing.\\xa0 It’s not fair.\\xa0 So, it’s not a question of reduction; it’s a question of will they contribute toward the defense of their own nation.\\n\\nWe’re defending nations that are very wealthy.\\xa0 South Korea is a very wealthy nation.\\xa0 They make our television sets.\\xa0 They make ships.\\xa0 They make everything.\\xa0 And I give them great credit.\\n\\nWe’ve been defending them for many, many decades, as you know.\\xa0 Many, many — over eight decades.\\xa0 And I’ve gone to them in the past.\\xa0 Last year, I went to them and now they’re paying a billion dollars a year.\\xa0 And I went to them again, I said, “Look, I’ll be back because that’s just a fraction.”\\xa0 And again, the relationship is great, but it’s just not a fair relationship.\\n\\nWe renegotiated the trade deal and made it a much more equitable deal than it was in the past.\\xa0 It was a terrible deal. It was done by Hillary Clinton.\\xa0 It was a terrible deal.\\xa0 The new deal is a much more equitable deal — that’s on trade.\\n\\nBut, on the military, I mean, we’re paying for the military for — to defend another nation that’s 8,500 miles away.\\xa0 And they’re not the only one I’m talking to you, by the way, as you know.\\xa0 I won’t go into names, but I’ve done this.\\xa0 Nobody talks about it, but I think it’s appropriate.\\xa0 I think the taxpayer of our country — taxpayers — want to hear these things.\\xa0 And so now they’re — they’ve offered us a certain amount of money, and I have rejected it.\\xa0 I just said, “It’s just — look, you know, we’re doing a tremendous service.”\\xa0 We have a wonderful feeling and a wonderful relationship with each other, but we have to be treated equitably and fairly.\\xa0 And so that’s where it is right now.\\xa0 And what’s going to happen, I can’t tell you, but we’ll find out fairly soon.\\n\\nBut I congratulate the President, who is a friend of mine — I congratulate President Moon on having a terrific victory.\\n\\nPlease.\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 A question for you about Governor Cuomo’s visit, and then also a question for Dr. Birx, if you’ll let me.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The New York governor, along with the National Governors Association, in the past, have called for aid to be unrestricted.\\xa0 As a lot of state and local governments see their revenues drop, are you open to the idea of unrestricted aid or do you want it to be pandemic-specific?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re going to be talking about that in phase four, as you know, which will start very shortly.\\xa0 And that has to do with infrastructure — hopefully infrastructure, because this country needs infrastructure.\\n\\nWe spend all this money in the Middle East — $8 trillion.\\xa0 Eight trillion — trillion, with a “T” — dollars in the Middle East, but if you have a pothole in a highway someplace, they don’t want you to spend the money to fix it.\\xa0 How stupid have we been in this country?\\xa0 How stupid have we been?\\xa0 And that’s changing rapidly — you know that; you’ve seen that — including things like negotiating with friends.\\n\\nBut when we are helping friends, friends should reimburse us for the cost.\\xa0 I mean, why should we be defending nations for free?\\xa0 We’re defending a nation for free.\\xa0 Now I’m getting a billion dollars a year, and we’re — we’ll be getting — we were offered much more than that, but I turned it down.\\xa0 So that’s where we are with that.\\n\\nAs far as — as far as the other is concerned, look, we have to be smart in this country.\\xa0 We’ve been taken to the cleaner by every — and I mean with allies, not just with the enemies — with allies.\\xa0 We’ve been to — frankly, the allies have taken us much more so than the enemies.\\xa0 The enemies we don’t do business with, right?\\xa0 The allies, we do business with.\\n\\nAnd whoever made these deals, whoever made these contracts — in many cases, we didn’t have a contract.\\xa0 Like, we didn’t have a contract — we didn’t have a trade deal with China.\\xa0 They came in and they took $500 billion a year for many years.\\xa0 But anywhere from $200- to $550 billion dollars a year out of our hides.\\n\\nNow we made this great trade deal.\\xa0 Unfortunately, that was a number of months ago.\\xa0 And it’s a great deal.\\xa0 They’re paying 25 percent on $250 billion. \\xa0They’re — a lot of things are happening.\\xa0 They’re going to have to purchase $250 billion worth of goods, including farm product — up to $50 billion.\\n\\nSo, a lot of good things are happening, but then what happened with China was the plague hit us, right?\\xa0 The plague. That was after.\\xa0 This was long after we signed the deal.\\xa0 The plague hit us, so I’m not happy about that.\\n\\nOkay.\\xa0 John, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A question for Dr. Birx, if I could.\\xa0 Dr. Birx, a question on the virus itself: As it passes from patient to patient, it mutates.\\xa0 Over time, have you picked up any indication that it has become less virulent?\\xa0 Have you picked up any indication it has become more virulent?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 You know, that is an excellent question because we watch that all the time, particularly with RNA viruses, to really track its adaptation to humans.\\xa0 I mean, you’re really asking: Has this virus become more adapted to humans and more able to spread, or is it becoming less adapted to humans and less able to spread?\\n\\nWe don’t have any indication that it’s less able to spread, and we’ll have good analyses that will come from — obviously, the Roosevelt had its incident with a virus outside of the United States, and we’ll be able to look at those parameters.\\xa0 And the DOD and the military have done a great job in really ensuring the health of the sailors, but also ensuring that this — these questions can really be asked and answered.\\n\\nWe have extraordinary evolutionary molecular biologists in this country, all around the United States, and they’re looking at this very question.\\xa0 And a lot of the work that we’ve been doing and a lot — you’ll see a lot of work happening with testing in New Mexico and testing in other states.\\xa0 They have extraordinary molecular biologists that are evolutionary biologists, and they’ll be able to look at that, both in — both in New Mexico, that it may have lower transmission rates, and compare that to New York, that has maybe 10x the transmission.\\n\\nBut it’s an excellent question, and it’s something that will be able to be answered by what we see in the United States.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 John, what a good question that was.\\xa0 Where did that come from?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You know, once in a while, I pull one out of my hat, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, that’s very impressive.\\n\\nYou know, when Senator Schumer wrote a letter a couple of months ago, and he said, “You should use admirals and generals.” I said, “Well, that’s where we’ve…”\\xa0 First of all, we have our Vice President, who has been incredible, but we have the admirals, we have the generals.\\xa0 And I was just talking to the admiral inside, just before we came out.\\xa0 I said, “Did you go to Annapolis?”\\xa0 He said, “No sir.”\\xa0 I said, “Oh, that’s too bad.\\xa0 That’s too bad.\\xa0 Where did you go?”\\xa0 He said, “I went to Harvard.”\\xa0 “Oh, that’s okay too, I guess.”\\xa0 Right?\\n\\nSo he went to Harvard and he was a great student at Harvard, and he’s doing a fantastic job.\\xa0 And this young gentleman was very, very successful.\\xa0 But he wanted to help the country.\\xa0 He wanted to come into the country, and we appreciate it very much.\\xa0 He was a big success — a big, big success.\\n\\nLet’s do here, and there next.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 We’re all set.\\xa0 Good.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 I was hoping you’d talk about your meeting tomorrow with Governor Cuomo that you mentioned.\\xa0 Is there a reason he is coming all the way down here?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 He wanted to, and —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is that sort of travel essential?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We, believe it or not, have — we get along.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 He was very generous yesterday, in particular. Said we did a, quote, “phenomenal” deal.\\xa0 I don’t know if anybody wrote that, but he said that, and I appreciated it.\\xa0 Because it’s not about me; it’s about these people and thousands behind Mike and the admiral and all of the other people that are working with us.\\n\\nI mean — and you see it.\\xa0 Look, I don’t understand when — when I see polling and approval ratings for the job.\\xa0 I mean, this group should get a 95.\\xa0 It really should.\\xa0 And we’re really helping the governors a lot.\\xa0 And the governors call me — the ones I know, or the Republicans, but the ones I know — and they say, “It’s incredible, the job you’re doing.”\\xa0 Again, not me — the job this group is doing.\\n\\nAnd you sit here — I just — I’m watching from — from the corner, and I’m just saying, “Boy, it’s incredible stuff.”\\xa0 When you watch the general get up — General Semonite — and talk about — boom, boom, boom.\\xa0 You don’t see that.\\xa0 You don’t see that.\\xa0 When you hear the admiral speak about the testing — how good it is — and yet people don’t like to say it.\\n\\nBut remember, it was all about ventilators a month ago. Ventilators, ventilat- — then we fixed it.\\xa0 You don’t hear about ventilators.\\xa0 Where is the ventilator — Jeff, you haven’t asked about ventilators recently.\\xa0 What’s going on?\\xa0 What about ventilators?\\xa0 We’re helping other countries now, because they can’t have — they’re very hard to come by, and they take a long time to make — like, years.\\xa0 It’s incredible, the job they’ve done — that our people have done and also private companies have done.\\n\\nYou know, you talk about the act.\\xa0 We — we don’t like to use it unless we have to.\\xa0 Because, a lot of times, just the fact that you have it gets you everything you need.\\xa0 So, you know, we don’t want to embarrass any of the companies.\\xa0 But we have used it on a number of occasions and it worked.\\xa0 But it works just as well before you have to use it, because they don’t want to be embarrassed, and I don’t want to embarrass them because they’ve done a great job.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I think, right behind you.\\xa0 I promised. I can’t — I cannot tell a lie.\\xa0 So, I mean, we’ll get you next.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’ll get you next.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you talking to her or me?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no.\\xa0 You.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Me.\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Well, thank you so much, Mr. President.\\xa0 My question — I have two questions.\\xa0 The first one is on testing.\\xa0 You talked about the idea that first it was ventilators, and now it’s testing.\\xa0 You seem to maybe possibly be implying that talking about testing is a personal attack on you.\\xa0 Can you explain why you think testing — talking about testing is a personal attack, given that the access to testing has been an issue for a long time?\\xa0 There’s bipartisan outcries still today that there is not enough testing.\\xa0 Why do you think it’s a personal attack on you?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it’s not bipartisan.\\xa0 It’s mostly partisan.\\xa0 But more importantly than mostly partisan, it’s incorrect.\\xa0 You have — you have the experts.\\xa0 Look at these maps.\\xa0 I mean, you have the maps with so many different locations.\\n\\nIn the case of, as an example, Governor Hogan.\\xa0 He didn’t really know.\\xa0 He really — it was very obvious to any of those listening on the call today — even though you weren’t supposed to be on it, I’m sure that some of you were or representatives were.\\xa0 He really didn’t know about the federal laboratories.\\xa0 Would you say that’s correct, Mike?\\xa0 He didn’t know.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He didn’t know they were available.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He didn’t know.\\xa0 And Mike doesn’t like to get into this stuff.\\xa0 He’s less controversial than I am.\\xa0 But he didn’t know about it.\\xa0 And if he did know about it, he would’ve been happy.\\n\\nNo, we’ve done a really good job on testing.\\xa0 Now, with that being said, we have tests coming out perhaps over the next two weeks that will blow the whole industry away.\\xa0 Now, a lot of people love the Abbott test.\\xa0 So do I.\\xa0 You know, the Abbott test is great because it’s, boom, it’s — they touch, they put it in, and in five minutes you have — the problem is that doesn’t do massive numbers like the big machine.\\xa0 But the big machine takes a day, takes a day and a half, you know, with delivery and everything else.\\n\\nBut we have tremendous testing — tremendous testing capability.\\xa0 Remember this: We’ve tested more than any country in the world by far.\\xa0 In fact, I think I read where if you add up every other country in the world, we’ve tested more.\\n\\nBut remember this: We’re dealing in politics, we’re dealing with a thing called — November 3rd of this year.\\xa0 Do you know what November 3rd represents, right?\\xa0 You know better than anybody in the room.\\xa0 November 3rd of this year — it’s called the presidential election.\\xa0 No matter what I do, no matter where we go, no matter how well we do, no matter what, if I came up with a tablet, you take it and this plague is gone, they’ll say, “Trump did a terrible job.\\xa0 Terrible.\\xa0 Terrible.”\\xa0 Because that’s their soundbite.\\xa0 That’s the political soundbite.\\n\\nThey know the great job we’ve done.\\xa0 But with all of that being said and — and also, there is a thing that somebody could talk to if they want, but I don’t want to bore you with it.\\xa0 Not everybody believes we should do so much testing.\\xa0 You don’t need so much.\\xa0 We’re talking about maximum.\\xa0 Maximum.\\n\\nThe reason that the Democrats — and some others, maybe, because they don’t know — they want maximum because they want to be able to criticize.\\xa0 Because it’s almost impossible to get to the maximum number, and yet we’ve been able to do it already.\\n\\nBut with that — and you’ll be seeing this over the next — I think over the next couple of weeks or sooner.\\xa0 We have a test — if it comes out, it’ll revolutionize the whole world of testing.\\xa0 It’ll be — it’ll be something really special.\\n\\nSo I don’t view it as personal at all.\\xa0 What I do say is, it’s something that’s not fair to thousands of people that have done such a good job.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The second question I had was about your language and how you approached the coronavirus at the beginning.\\xa0 I interviewed someone who said that his family got sick.\\xa0 They went to a funeral in mid-March, and they said mainly because the President wasn’t taking it seriously.\\xa0 He said, “If the President had had a mask on, if he was saying we should stay home, then I would have stayed home.\\xa0 Instead I had family members…”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I know.\\xa0 I understand.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I just want to — and he said his family members were sick because they were — they were listening to you.\\xa0 Do you feel like or are you concerned that downplaying the virus maybe —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — got some people sick?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And a lot of people love Trump, right?\\xa0 A lot of people love me.\\xa0 You see them all the time, right?\\xa0 I guess I’m here for a reason, you know?\\xa0 To the best of my knowledge, I won.\\xa0 And I think we’re going to win again.\\xa0 I think we’re going to win in a landslide.\\n\\nBut just so you understand, you’re talking about March, right?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 But this is —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And yet — excuse me.\\xa0 Excuse me,\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — this is an American that’s concerned.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I know.\\xa0 I understand.\\xa0 And yet, in January, a certain date — you know the date better than I do — we put on a ban of China, where China can’t come in.\\xa0 And before March, we put on a ban on Europe, where Europe can’t come in.\\xa0 So how could you say I wasn’t taking it seriously?\\n\\nYou know, I put on a ban on China before anybody in this country died.\\xa0 I put on a ban.\\xa0 And so you tell me.\\xa0 Nancy Pelosi was having — she wanted to have a street party in Chinatown in San Francisco at the end of February.\\xa0 That’s a month later.\\xa0 And then they tell me it’s only a political talking point.\\xa0 But you feed into it, because you’re too good a reporter to let that happen.\\xa0 Really, you are a good reporter.\\xa0 You’re too good a reporter to let that happen.\\n\\nRemember this: So at the end of January, I put on a ban.\\xa0 People that were in that room will tell you — I think there were 21 people — I was the only one in the whole room that wanted to do it.\\xa0 Fortunately, I was the one that counted for that purpose.\\xa0 We put on a ban because I was reading bad things about China.\\xa0 World Health Organization should have told us, but I was reading it, with or without them.\\xa0 They should have known.\\xa0 All they had to do is read it.\\xa0 They didn’t have to even be there.\\xa0 But they tried to cover up for China — World Health covered up for China.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But you did hold — you held rallies in February and March.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But — no, no.\\xa0 Wait.\\xa0 But you can’t say this.\\xa0 Look, I put on a ban.\\xa0 In other words, I stopped China from coming to the United States.\\xa0 I stopped Europe from coming into the United States, long before the March date that you’re talking about.\\xa0 So people should say I acted very early.\\xa0 That was a very hard thing to do.\\xa0 Doing that was a very hard thing.\\xa0 I didn’t want to do that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But you held rallies in February and March.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But I did it because I thought — and Dr. Fauci said that, by doing it, President Trump saved tens of thousands of lives.\\xa0 So I did take it very seriously.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You held rallies in February and in March.\\xa0 And there are some Americans saying —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, I don’t know — I don’t know about rallies.\\xa0 I really don’t know about rallies.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You had about five rallies in February.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I know one thing: I haven’t left the White House in months, except for a brief moment to give a wonderful ship, the Comfort —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You held a rally in March.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 Did I hold a rally?\\xa0 I’m sorry I hold a rally.\\xa0 Did I hold a rally?\\xa0 Let me tell you, in January, when I did this, you had virtually no cases and no deaths, and yet I put it on.\\xa0 So how could I not?\\n\\nWhy was Nancy Pelosi — right? — Nancy Pelosi is holding a street fair.\\xa0 She wants a street fair in San Francisco, in Chinatown, to prove — you know what the purpose of it was — to prove that there’s no problem.\\xa0 Many other politicians did the same thing.\\xa0 They wanted to prove —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you (inaudible) —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 While I was — no, of course not.\\xa0 No, no, no.\\xa0 I’ve been — people are amazed at how early I acted, and I did act early.\\xa0 With that being said, it’s very hard to say, “Let’s close down the greatest economy in the history of the world.”\\xa0 I had it closed down.\\xa0 I, and everybody else that works with me, and 300 and — close to 350 million people built the greatest economy in the history of the world: best employment numbers, best stock market numbers, best numbers in virtually every category.\\xa0 Even good manufacturing numbers.\\xa0 The previous administration said manufacturing was dead for our country.\\xa0 Even great manufacturing numbers.\\n\\nAnd you know what?\\xa0 I did that, and somebody walked into my office and said, “Sir, you’re going to have to close down the economy.\\xa0 You’re going to have to close the country.”\\xa0 But you know what I say to you?\\xa0 We’re going to rebuild it.\\xa0 And we’re going to rebuild it better, and it’s going to go faster than people think.\\xa0 I built it once; I’ll built it a second time.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, thank you.\\xa0 Chanel Rion with One America News.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 We have — in going back to the topic of friendship and bipartisanship — Americans — with the exception of Pelosi, Schumer, and even Romney — Americans have seen an unprecedented chapter of bipartisanship and cooperation on the political landscape.\\xa0 On a personal note, what has been the most significant signal that your relationship with Democrats, below the leadership level, have changed for the good of America?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think it’s a great question, because there is bipartisanship.\\xa0 Look, we’re getting the Paycheck Plan.\\xa0 It’s — already $350 billion was approved, essentially unanimously.\\xa0 And we have another 250, which I think you’re going to find out is going to be a higher number than that.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 I won’t say it now, because I don’t know if they’ve released it or not, but it’s going to end up being more than $250 billion.\\xa0 And this is going to small businesses and it’s going to workers.\\n\\nAnd these are really bipartisan plans.\\xa0 It’s a great thing that’s happening.\\xa0 So I think the fact that we’re able to do all of this in a bipartisan way is great.\\n\\nNow, the tax cuts that the Republicans did, we had no help from the Democrats, so you can’t say that’s bipartisan.\\xa0 But this whole thing, getting our country back — and, you know, Nancy Pelosi has been — she’s very nasty.\\xa0 She, you know, wasted a lot of time with the impeachment hoax.\\xa0 It was a total hoax.\\xa0 It went nowhere.\\xa0 But — and that was not good.\\xa0 And Schumer, I guess, did the same thing, but he sort of accepted it.\\xa0 He just did what he was supposed to do, and he didn’t do very well with it.\\xa0 But, you know, that was not appropriate.\\xa0 That was a bad thing for our country.\\xa0 But it was fine.\\xa0 I mean, I understand the game.\\n\\nThey have a little bit of a majority.\\xa0 So they say, “Let’s do something and let’s try and stir it up.”\\xa0 But they wasted a year.\\xa0 They wasted tremendous — we could’ve been doing things that would have been great for our country.\\xa0 They could have been looking into China.\\xa0 They should have been looking into China, as an example.\\xa0 A lot of people are blaming the Democrats for wasting all that time, because it was during that period of time, as you know, that it was fomenting.\\n\\nBut I think we’ve had a great spirit of bipartisanship, in a certain way.\\xa0 It’s not — I wouldn’t say we’re going to set records throughout the world, but things are happening that are very good.\\xa0 The country is coming together.\\xa0 And I’ll tell you what: The people are coming together.\\xa0 The people are really coming together.\\xa0 I think you’re going to find that our country is much more unified.\\n\\nI do think that the press, the media, foments a lot of this — a lot of anger.\\xa0 I really believe it.\\xa0 It foments tremendous anger.\\xa0 For instance, I’ll be asked a tremendously hostile question from somebody, and then I’ll answer to — in a hostile way, which is appropriate; otherwise, you look foolish.\\xa0 Otherwise, it looks like just walk off the stage and bow your head.\\xa0 I can’t do that.\\xa0 You know, I just can’t do that.\\n\\nBut a lot of these questions that are asked from certain networks are so hostile, and there’s no reason for it.\\xa0 There’s no reason for it.\\xa0 We are in a war.\\xa0 This is a World War Two, this is a World War One — where, by the way, the war essentially ended because of a plague.\\xa0 That was one of the worst ever.\\xa0 They lost almost 100 million people.\\xa0 But we’re in a big war.\\n\\nAnd I’ll say one thing about — because I think it’s important.\\xa0 The last person — I did it early, but I was the last person that wanted to close down one of the great economic — you can’t call it an experiment, but everything, I guess, in life is an experiment.\\xa0 So I say experiments.\\xa0 But one of the great economic stories in history.\\xa0 I’m the last person who wanted to do it.\\n\\nBut we did the right thing, because if we didn’t do it, you would have had a million people, a million and a half people, maybe 2 million people dead.\\xa0 Now, we’re going toward 50, I’m hearing, or 60,000 people.\\xa0 One is too many.\\xa0 I always say it: One is too many.\\xa0 But we’re going toward 50- or 60,000 people.\\xa0 That’s at the lower — as you know, the low number was supposed to be 100,000 people.\\xa0 We — we could end up at 50 to 60.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 It’s horrible.\\xa0 If we didn’t do what we did, we would have had, I think, a million people, maybe 2 million people, maybe more than that.\\n\\nAnd you look — there’s one country in particular that decided, “Let’s wing it.\\xa0 Let’s just keep going.”\\xa0 They are being inundated with death.\\xa0 Now, if you take a look at some of the hospitals where — one of them I knew growing up in Queens, and I’m looking at the bodies laying in hallways, being brought into refrigerated trucks.\\xa0 The trucks — these massive trucks, bodies going in.\\xa0 Multiply that times 10.\\xa0 It’s not sustainable.\\n\\nAnd many of the people that have this theory, “Oh, let’s — you know, maybe we could have just gone right through it,” I was — I was somebody that would have loved to have done that, but it wouldn’t have been sustainable.\\xa0 You can’t lose a million people.\\xa0 That’s more than — that’s almost double what we lost in the Civil War.\\xa0 I use that as a guide.\\xa0 Civil War: 600,000 people died.\\xa0 So it’s not sustainable.\\xa0 But it could have been much more than a million people.\\n\\nI mean, if you took a number and cut it half, and half, and in half again, you’d end up at 500,000 people — okay? — if you want to make a very conservative guesstimate.\\xa0 Five hundred thousand people is not acceptable.\\xa0 Is that a correct sort of an analogy?\\n\\nSo, I mean, I see it all the time by friends of mine, by people that I have great respect for: “Well, we could have done this.\\xa0 We could have done…”\\xa0 And remember this: When we say 50 and they compare 50 to the 35 of the flu — because it averaged 35, 36,000 over a 10-year period.\\xa0 It’s a lot.\\xa0 Who would think that?\\xa0 But we’re not talking about with the flu.\\xa0 That’s just — it just goes.\\xa0 We’re not locking ourselves in our units.\\xa0 We’re not locking ourselves in our apartments and not moving and not touching anybody, and just saying — you know, the world.\\xa0 In this case, we are.\\xa0 And we’re still going to lose between 50 and 60.\\n\\nBut if we just kept it going on a normal basis, which is really the only standard that you can compare it to with the flu, because that was a normal basis.\\xa0 You get into an airplane, you travel to Florida, you go to Texas.\\xa0 You go wherever you’re going.\\n\\nBut, in this case, if we didn’t do anything, the number wouldn’t be 50 to 60,000.\\xa0 The number would be a million people dead.\\xa0 It would be a million-five, a million-two.\\xa0 Maybe 700,000.\\xa0 It would have been a number in — like that.\\n\\nBecause — because — and it’s so important because I see so much: “Oh, well, you know, they can…”\\xa0 You can’t compare it, because I’ll tell you what: The people of this country, what they’ve done — they’ve gone out of their way — what they — the way they’ve lived, it hasn’t — it’s not — it’s not great.\\xa0 It’s terrible.\\xa0 Maybe the first three days, and then all of a sudden — you see what’s going on; they want to get going.\\xa0 And I get that fully.\\n\\nBut I just say this: If we would have done that, we would have lost anywhere from a million to more than 2 million people.\\xa0 Now, with all of the death that we’ve seen — and 50- or 60,000 people, heading toward — right now it’s at 40.\\xa0 But 50- or 60,000 people; probably over 50, from what I see.\\xa0 But that’s with our guard up.\\xa0 If we took our guard down and just said, “Okay, we’re just going to keep this open,”\\xa0we would have lost millions of people.\\xa0 Can you imagine?\\n\\nLook how bad it looks now, when you look at the bodies.\\xa0 When you look at Hart Island in New York, where they have the mass grave, and all of the things that you see.\\xa0 Can you imagine if we had the guard down, if we didn’t do anything and we just said, “Let’s ride it out”?\\xa0 It would not have been sustainable in any way.\\xa0 It would have been an atrocity.\\n\\nSo we’ve done the right thing.\\xa0 We’ve really done the right thing.\\xa0 And the people that have worked so hard — and dangerously.\\xa0 I’ll tell you — again, I say it, but I watch those doctors and nurses and medical people running into those hospitals, and they don’t even have their gear on.\\xa0 Forget about gear, whether it’s great gear or not.\\xa0 And we’re bringing in the best gear in the world.\\xa0 But they’re running in with open everything, and they’re pushing.\\xa0 I mean, the job — they’re like warriors, the job they’re doing.\\n\\nBut if we didn’t do the moves that we made, you would have had a million, a million and a half, 2 million people dead.\\xa0 So multiply that times 50; you’re talking about — you would have had 10 to 20 to 25 times more people dead than all of the people that we’ve been watching.\\xa0 That’s not acceptable.\\xa0 The 50,000 is not acceptable.\\xa0 It’s so horrible.\\xa0 But can you imagine multiplying that out by 20 or more?\\xa0 It’s not acceptable.\\n\\nSo it’s a very good question.\\xa0 I appreciate it.\\xa0 We’ll see you tomorrow.\\xa0 We’ll see you tomorrow.\\n\\nEND\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 7:18 P.M.

       "  'text': 'April 19, 2020\\n6:28 P.M. EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 I’d like to begin by saying that we’re continuing to negotiate with the Democrats to get our great workers and small businesses all over the country taken care of.\\xa0 I think we — we’re getting close to a deal.\\xa0 It could happen.\\xa0 It could happen.\\xa0 A lot of good work has been going on, and we could have an answer tomorrow.\\xa0 And we’re going to see what — what exactly does take place.\\n\\nWe’re also looking at helping our hospitals and our rural hospitals, who have been hurt very badly.\\xa0 The rural hospitals, for a long time, have not been treated properly.\\xa0 We’re looking to help them, and beyond.\\xa0 So we’re looking at hospitals also, as part of the package.\\xa0 And we’ll see how that all comes out.\\n\\nBut a lot of good things are happening.\\xa0 Some very good negotiations.\\xa0 I just got off the phone with the Secretary of the Treasury, and we have some very good negotiations going on right now.\\xa0 And I think you could have a nice answer tomorrow, but we’ll see.\\n\\nAmerica continues to make steady progress in our war against the virus.\\xa0 As of today, we’ve tested 4.18 million Americans.\\xa0 That’s a record anywhere in the world.\\xa0 The United States has now conducted more total tests than all of the following nations combined: France, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria, Australia, Sweden, and Canada.\\n\\nAnd our testing is expanding very rapidly by millions and millions of people.\\xa0 So we’ve — we’ve done more testing than all of these countries combined: France, United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria, and Australia, Sweden, and Canada.\\xa0 That’s something.\\xa0 Right?\\n\\nWe’re doing a great job.\\xa0 We’re — we are.\\xa0 This team is an incredible team, and that includes Army Corps of Engineers, a lot of our military people, our admirals, our generals.\\xa0 Got one of our great admirals here, who’s done an incredible job.\\xa0 You haven’t slept too much in the last two months either.\\xa0 Look at him.\\xa0 (Laughs.)\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 No, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s — somebody said to me, “President, you look tired.”\\xa0 I said, “I should be tired.”\\xa0 We should all be tired.\\xa0 But we have to win, right?\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Tomorrow, the President — the Vice President will lead a call with our nation’s governors from FEMA headquarters, Mike —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — to review what more they can do and do together to develop locally tailored testing strategies.\\xa0 Working very hard with governors now on testing.\\xa0 We want to help them out.\\n\\nBefore the call, we’ll send them a full list of all of the large laboratory machines in the states.\\xa0 They have a lot of machinery in the states that some aren’t that aware of, but they’re there, and they’re really high-quality machines, by the way.\\xa0 And the potential capacity of those machines, if they’re fully utilized — a couple of them didn’t know that they could be utilized in a different manner.\\xa0 They’re only up to 10 percent, and they can go 90 percent more.\\n\\nMany governors are still relying on their state laboratories rather than the full and much larger capacity that is available to them.\\xa0 As an example, commercial laboratories, such as Quest and LabCorp — these are massive laboratories that can handle a lot more than they’re being sent.\\xa0 A few days ago, it was at 30 percent.\\xa0 They’re only at 30 percent capacity now.\\xa0 I don’t know — probably the same, but they have a lot of capacity.\\n\\nIn addition, academic laboratories, big research labs — there’s tremendous capacity out there.\\xa0 And some of them want the fast — you know, the instant Abbott machine, which just came about due to the research during this little short period of time.\\xa0 And it’s very quick, but these labs can do them very quickly also, and they’re — they’re massive.\\xa0 They can handle much more — much more than the machine, the small machine, can handle.\\n\\nWe continue to procure millions of swabs, test collectors.\\xa0 I have something here.\\xa0 Just happen to have it.\\xa0 It’s a swab.\\xa0 It looks innocent.\\xa0 Not very complicated.\\xa0 Anybody like to see what it looks like?\\xa0 Should I open it?\\xa0 Does everybody?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Open it up.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, please.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 “Open it up.”\\xa0 I will.\\xa0 I will.\\xa0 This is what it’s about.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 Is it — does it remind you of something?\\xa0 It reminds you of this, right?\\xa0 One is a swab and one is a Q-tip.\\xa0 It’s actually different.\\xa0 It’s very sophisticated, actually.\\xa0 But it’s a little bit like — so this is the swab.\\n\\nAnd we’ve ordered a lot of them.\\xa0 They have a lot of them.\\xa0 Some of them — some of the states — they were shipped to states, and the states don’t know where they are.\\xa0 And — but that’s — that’s it.\\n\\nWhy don’t we give this to Karen?\\xa0 Perhaps she’ll take an extra test.\\xa0 (Laughs.)\\xa0 Right?\\n\\nBut this is a big deal.\\xa0 And we’re working on it, and we’re working with the companies.\\xa0 And I think, in the end, we’re going to have — we’re going to have — we’re going to have a tremendous — a tremendous success.\\n\\nNo — nobody is close to us.\\xa0 No country is close to us.\\xa0 In fact — and I appreciate it very much — the Wall Street Journal wrote a fantastic piece, a highly respected gentleman: Christopher DeMuth.\\xa0 And this piece was just in the Wall Street Journal Weekend Edition.\\xa0 And “Trump Rewrites the Book on Emergencies.”\\xa0 That’s what’s happened too.\\xa0 And we — I’ll just read one paragraph:\\n\\n“He’s given pride of place to federalism and private enterprise, lauding the patriotism and proficiency of our fantastic governors and mayors” — meaning, I do call them fantastic when it’s appropriate — “and our incredible business leaders and genius companies.”\\xa0 I guess I probably use those terms too, when they’re doing a good job.\\xa0 When they’re not doing a good job, I don’t use those terms.\\n\\n“Our heroic doctors and nurses and orderlies and our tremendous truckers” — they have all done good jobs — “by shouting out many of them by name and documenting their deeds on a fully daily basis, he has vivified the American way in action (once [it was] reluctantly aroused).”\\xa0 It was hard to get it aroused, and it is hard to get it aroused, but we got it aroused.\\xa0 “When asked why he has not issued orders for nationwide home and business lockdowns, he has emphasized that the intensity of the epidemic varies widely and is best met by calibrated state and local judgments.”\\xa0 That’s the judgments of governors and local people.\\xa0 And added pointedly that “such steps would conflict with the Constitution.”\\n\\nBut very importantly, he’s just a very respected gentleman.\\xa0 To see this was a very nice feeling — not for me, necessarily, but for all of the people that have worked with us.\\xa0 I mean, they’ve — they have worked so hard.\\n\\nAnd we’ve developed tests that are so fantastic.\\xa0 We’ve — we’ve come up with things that nobody had ever heard of, and we did it during — during this pandemic.\\xa0 We did it under pressure.\\xa0 It’s called “reaction under pressure.”\\xa0 It’s pretty amazing what our people have done.\\xa0 And that includes all of our military people, and our CDC — just about everybody you can imagine — including Tony and Deborah.\\xa0 And they’ve worked long hours.\\xa0 There’s nobody that’s getting a lot of sleep.\\n\\nWe’re close to finalizing — I want to thank the writer, Christopher, of this article, and it’s a great article.\\xa0 That was, frankly — at least of what I read, it was a great article.\\xa0 We appreciate it.\\n\\nWe’re close to finalizing the second partnership through which a U.S. manufacturer would convert its existing plant to produce over 10 million additional swabs per month.\\xa0 And we should be ready to announce this in a very short period of time.\\n\\nWe also are going to be using, and we’re preparing to use, the Defense Production Act to increase swab production in one U.S. facility by over 20 million additional swabs per month.\\n\\nWe’ve had a little difficulty with one, so we’re going to call in — as we have in the past, as you know — we’re calling in the Defense Production Act, and we’ll be getting the swabs, very easily.\\xa0 Swabs are easy.\\xa0 Ventilators are hard.\\xa0 Ventilators are a big deal, and we are now the king of ventilators.\\xa0 We have so many ventilators.\\xa0 You know, I said nobody that needed a ventilator has been turned down.\\xa0 It’s pretty amazing.\\xa0 Nobody.\\n\\nWe’re working with the world-class team at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to use its injection-molding capacity to potentially produce over 10 million collection tubes per week.\\xa0 That’s tremendous numbers.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the Supply Chain and Logistics Task Force continues to surge testing and needed supplies all throughout America.\\xa0 Mike’s team and the task force, they just met; they’ve been meeting virtually every day.\\xa0 And it’s a great team.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 It’s a great team.\\xa0 They’ve been doing a great job, Mike.\\xa0 You’ve been doing a great job.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They are.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Many governors are doing this incredible work, and they’re working with us very closely on testing and working in their states.\\xa0 And again, it should be a local thing because it’s point.\\xa0 It’s all these points within a state.\\xa0 But we’re helping them a lot, and we want to help them a lot.\\xa0 We’re going to help them more than a lot, actually, if you think about it, with what we’ve done.\\xa0 Think of it: We’ve done more than all those countries combined.\\n\\nWe’re encouraging them to share their successful strategies with other governors.\\xa0 Some of the governors are doing a better job than others.\\xa0 The robust capacity that we’ve brought online will empower governors to deploy sophisticated strategies so they can safely reopen their states.\\n\\nSome people believe in testing very strongly, and other people believe in it less strongly.\\xa0 But still, it’s a very good thing to have.\\xa0 I think we can say that.\\xa0 Some people believe in it like they can’t exist without testing, and other people don’t believe in it nearly as much.\\xa0 They can see how they’re doing, and they feel how they’re doing.\\xa0 And they’ve been pretty vocal about that.\\xa0 I think you know pretty much who I’m talking about.\\xa0 But I believe if they want it, we should give it to them and get it get it for them and work with them.\\n\\nYou must remember that the governors wanted to have total control over the opening of their states, but now they want to have us, the federal government, do the testing.\\xa0 And again, testing is local.\\xa0 You can’t have it both ways.\\xa0 Testing is a local thing.\\xa0 And it’s very important.\\xa0 It’s great.\\xa0 But it’s a local thing.\\xa0 And we’re going to get — we’re going to get it done to a level in a very short period of time, because all of these — all the swabs are coming in, all of the necessary materials.\\xa0 A lot of them, as I said, are already there, but a lot of people don’t know that yet.\\n\\nBut we’ll be doing testing at a level — already, we’re doing testing at a level nobody has ever done before, but we’ll be doing testing at a level that the biggest tester in the world will be very happy, very soon.\\xa0 And it is — it’s very much like ventilators.\\xa0 You don’t hear the word mentioned, and that’s much tougher — much tougher — when you have to build these machines.\\xa0 We built thousands of machines.\\n\\nWe’ll more than help the governors, and we’ll make sure that everything goes well, just like it did with ventilators; just, frankly, like it did with face masks — on a much easier subject, the face masks.\\xa0 Again, everything is easier than a ventilator.\\xa0 Ventilators are tough.\\n\\nBut, now, I spoke yesterday with the President of Mexico and with various other countries.\\xa0 We’re going to be helping them with ventilators.\\xa0 We have tremendous numbers of ventilators.\\n\\nIn fact, I — I hear — I understand that Governor Cuomo is going to be sending up to Massachusetts some of the excess ventilators that we were able to get, and that’s great.\\xa0 I think that’s a great thing.\\n\\nThe number of new hospital admissions is also significantly down.\\xa0 When you look at these numbers, it’s a good thing to see — other than the fact that we also know how people have been just ravaged by this — by this curse, by this horrible scourge, plague, call it — it’s got many different names.\\xa0 In many of the hotspots, including a 50 percent decline over a nine-day period in New York City.\\xa0 That’s a fantastic decline.\\xa0 It’s a beautiful thing to see after going through the opposite.\\n\\nWe continue to see improvement with declining trajectory of cases in Seattle, Detroit, New Orleans, Indianapolis, and Houston metro areas.\\xa0 More evidence that our aggressive strategy is working.\\xa0 And I thank the American people for their selfless devotion.\\xa0 The American people have done a hell of a job.\\xa0 We’re saving countless lives, though.\\n\\nAnd again, I’ll say it — because I always wanted to say, “Well, can you leave it open?”\\xa0 Nobody ever heard of anything like this.\\xa0 Not since 1917, more than 100 years ago, has anything like this happened.\\xa0 And in those days, they had no real communication so you couldn’t say, “Go inside.\\xa0 Don’t…”\\xa0 You know, people just died.\\xa0 Almost 100 million people, it’s reported.\\xa0 It’s tough.\\n\\nSo, you know, the American people, what they’ve done is — is incredible.\\xa0 And they’ve learned a lot, you know.\\xa0 You see people picketing a little bit, and they want to get out.\\xa0 They want to get out and get back with their lives, and that’s good.\\xa0 But they have learned a lot.\\xa0 They’ve learned about distancing, even now, at least until this thing totally goes away.\\xa0 They’ve learned about their washing their hands and all of the different things that we’ve been talking about ad nauseam for so long.\\xa0 And they get it.\\xa0 They get it.\\n\\nIn some places, the governors are ready to go; in other places, they can’t go yet, and they won’t go.\\xa0 They want to — they have to have it safe.\\xa0 I want it to be safe too.\\xa0 It has to be safe.\\n\\nAnd again, I have to say this.\\xa0 I can’t emphasize it strongly enough.\\xa0 I’m probably going to show you charts of some of the countries that are really having trouble, and one in particular is having a massive problem, where they said, “Let’s go.\\xa0 We’re just going to keep going.”\\xa0 Well, they’re the lines that you’re — we’re famous for now.\\xa0 Some are flat and some are up.\\n\\nThis is like a rocket ship.\\xa0 This country is — and they didn’t.\\xa0 They decided, “Let’s go and let’s wing it.”\\xa0 It’s — you know, they thought it was okay, but it’s — it’s a problem.\\xa0 It’s a big problem.\\n\\nAnd there’s another couple.\\xa0 There’s one in particular that everybody thinks did it, but the people are staying in.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 You know, the head of a country doesn’t have to say “stay in.”\\xa0 These people are smart people.\\xa0 They know what’s going on.\\xa0 They see what’s going on.\\xa0 So they don’t have to say.\\xa0 They can say they’re not doing that, but the people are staying inside.\\xa0 There are not a lot of people outside sitting at cafes, despite what the mode of a country is.\\n\\nBut if you look at Europe, most countries have done this.\\xa0 A couple tried not to.\\xa0 Italy tried not to, and they held it.\\xa0 And Spain tried not to; they went that way.\\xa0 France tried not to.\\xa0 I mean, nobody wants to do this.\\xa0 It’s a brutal step.\\xa0 “We’re going to close down your country.”\\xa0 Who ever heard of a thing like this?\\n\\nBut we would have had millions of people die if we didn’t do this.\\xa0 Millions of people.\\xa0 And I believe that, Mike.\\xa0 I think — you know, in looking at things that we’ve been looking at over the last couple of days, I think — and, really, over the last couple of weeks — from the time we did it, shortly thereafter I said we made the right decision in closing down.\\xa0 We made the right decision on borders, banning people coming in from China; banning, ultimately, people coming in from Europe.\\n\\nBut we would have had millions of deaths instead of — it looks like we’ll be at about a 60,000 mark, which is 40,000 less than the lowest number thought of.\\n\\nSo this isn’t a case where people would say, “Oh, we would have had that number.\\xa0 It’s similar to a flu.”\\xa0 It’s not the same thing as the flu at all, because if we wouldn’t have done anything, you would have had — so a flu would have 35, and that goes from 27 to 35, 40, 50 sometimes.\\xa0 It’s over a long period of time.\\xa0 Much different.\\xa0 It’s even a much different death, to be honest.\\xa0 It’s a much different death.\\xa0 This is violent.\\n\\nCMS is finalizing new guidelines for doctors and patients to resume elective surgeries.\\xa0 It’s a big thing.\\xa0 A lot of hospitals were closed.\\xa0 They couldn’t do any elective surgeries.\\xa0 They’ll be able to start doing that.\\xa0 Procedures and medical care that needs to be done in person — as long as the rate of infections remains low in a community, we want patients to be able to go to the doctors, get clinically tested, and have work done, surgeries, receive treatment for chronic conditions, and resume preventative care.\\xa0 So we’ll be allowing that to happen very soon.\\n\\nWe had no capacity in the hospitals with what happened with the — with the plague.\\xa0 We had no capacity to do it.\\xa0 If your doctor believes you need a treatment in person, you can get a treatment now.\\xa0 You can and should get a treatment now.\\n\\nWe are asking that healthcare facilities have plans in place to keep patients safe during their visit.\\xa0 Some places like New York, New Jersey, where they really got hit hard, it’s going to be a little bit tougher.\\xa0 They’ve done a great job, but they really were a center.\\xa0 I mean, they were a center.\\xa0 I was watching that; it was incredible.\\xa0 But now they’re — they’re leveling off, and I think there’ll be coming down very soon.\\n\\nAdministrator Seema Verma will be telling you a little bit more about it.\\xa0 Mike is going to say a few words.\\xa0 Seema will then speak and tell you a little bit more about that.\\n\\nMy administration continues to execute our massive military operation to supply our hospitals with equipment they need, and beds, if necessary.\\xa0 But it looks like we’re totally covered on beds.\\xa0 We have plenty of beds.\\xa0 It’s highly unlikely — that would be bad news if we needed more beds.\\xa0 But it looks like it’s going just the opposite direction.\\n\\nI want to thank Governor Cuomo — the relationship there — for this whole thing.\\xa0 We’re building hospitals.\\xa0 It was very good.\\xa0 We built a little bit more than we needed, and that’s good, as opposed to building a little bit less.\\xa0 That’s not good.\\xa0 But he’s worked very well with us.\\n\\nThe governor of Louisiana has been great on the bed — on that whole situation with the beds.\\n\\nFrankly, the governor of Michigan was very good with us on — on beds.\\xa0 You know, it’s a very complex subject.\\xa0 You need buildings or you have to do tents, or you have to do a lot of different things, a lot of different ways.\\n\\nBut the Army Corps of Engineers was fantastic.\\xa0 They were fantastic.\\n\\nFlorida likewise — Governor DeSantis.\\xa0 And I could name probably six other locations.\\n\\nI’ll tell you one: California was fantastic.\\xa0 He was really good.\\xa0 He was really good.\\xa0 And I appreciate the fact that he — he said what he wanted to say, and he wasn’t letting the press force him into saying something that he didn’t want to say.\\xa0 So I appreciate it very much.\\xa0 Governor of California.\\xa0 He really — he worked very hard.\\xa0 We worked together, and he worked very hard.\\n\\nThe federal government is currently procuring more than 100,000 ventilators through new production or purchases, with thousands already delivered.\\xa0 We’ve delivered thousands of brand-new ventilators all throughout the country.\\xa0 New York would be, I guess, the biggest user.\\xa0 And they are now taking some of their excess ventilators, which is great, and they’re sending them up to Massachusetts.\\xa0 I think it’s 400.\\xa0 And that’s — that’s a great thing.\\n\\nOur total supply of ventilators continues to exceed, by a lot, total expected demand.\\xa0 Governor Cuomo said today that no one who needed a ventilator was denied a ventilator.\\xa0 That’s a beautiful statement, I appreciate it.\\xa0 And all governors are in that same position.\\n\\nWe do have a clip that I thought would be appropriate to put up today.\\xa0 It’ll take two minutes, and I think you’ll find it interesting.\\xa0 But we appreciate it.\\n\\nAnd let’s see if we can do that.\\xa0 You’ll turn out the lights, and we’ll see if we can do that.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\n(A video is played.)\\n\\nWe actually had something else.\\xa0 Are they finished with it?\\xa0 They left out the good part.\\xa0 Great — great job, fellas.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What was the good part?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They did a better job on ventilators.\\xa0 No — Andrew had something else to say that was really nice, but we won’t go through that.\\xa0 But he really — I mean, it was really a good statement.\\n\\nDo you want to put the rest of it up, or do you not have it?\\n\\nI just think it’s so good because it’s bipartisan.\\xa0 You know, this is not about Democrats, Republicans.\\xa0 This is about a thing that hit our country, the likes of which has never happened to us before.\\xa0 Wars — those wars, Civil War.\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 The First World War, the Second World War — they’re not fought on this country.\\xa0 This is being fought on this country.\\xa0 But it’s being fought in 184 countries all over the world.\\xa0 It’s terrible.\\n\\nBut I want to thank Andrew — Governor Cuomo — for the statement.\\xa0 He actually — if you go a little bit further, it was — it was even far beyond even that.\\xa0 So that was great.\\xa0 Do you remember?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Should we run it again?\\n\\nADMINISTRATOR VERMA:\\xa0 They’re getting it to work —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Huh?\\n\\nADMINISTRATOR VERMA:\\xa0 They’re going to try to work on getting the first part of that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, that’s okay.\\xa0 Whatever.\\xa0 But it’s — it’s — he said some really good things.\\xa0 And that’s — it makes people feel good.\\xa0 It’s — actually, the Wall Street Journal — Christopher was saying, “I want to make people feel good too.”\\xa0 I want to make — when they’re doing a good job, I want to make people feel good.\\xa0 I want the Admiral to feel good.\\xa0 He’s worked so hard.\\xa0 Mike has worked so hard.\\n\\nAnd it was — it was very nice.\\xa0 You know, it was on this morning.\\xa0 It was all — it was Andrew this morning.\\xa0 It’s — it’s a little longer clip than that.\\xa0 But you’ll see it was, really, a very nice thing that he said.\\xa0 And people really appreciate that because they’ve done a great job.\\xa0 The federal government has done a great job.\\xa0 I mean, we — with all of it.\\xa0 And this is easy.\\xa0 The swabs are — that’s easy.\\xa0 We have them coming by the tens of millions.\\xa0 We have them coming at a level that — you’ll have so many swabs you won’t know what to do with them.\\xa0 That’s easy.\\n\\nSo they’ll all — they’ll all be there.\\xa0 A lot of them are there already.\\xa0 They’re learning about their testing capacity that they didn’t know about that — that we have in the various labs, including academic, they have to remember.\\xa0 You have a lot of these big colleges that have labs that are totally ready to help.\\xa0 But I want to thank the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve, because what they’ve done is incredible.\\xa0 That’s a capital D-V-R, by the way, an innovative public-private partnership.\\xa0 That’s what we created.\\n\\nWe’re gaining access to up to 65,000 additional ventilators and hospitals across the nation that can be redeployed very quickly to areas with the greatest need when they’re not in use.\\xa0 And we, right now, have almost 10,000 in our reserve.\\xa0 We’ve been able to give away thousands, like we helped Andrew or we helped fill.\\xa0 And New Jersey is doing a great job.\\xa0 Andrew will tell you that too.\\xa0 They have a very good relationship, working together and working with us.\\n\\nBut we have — now we’re back up to almost 10,000, and this is after giving away tens of thousands of ventilators.\\xa0 And we’re going to fill up the reserves of states.\\xa0 We’re going to work with them, so in case this happens again.\\n\\nBut we’re also going to help other countries.\\xa0 I was telling you, the President of Mexico — we’re going to be sending a pretty large quantity to Mexico — they very much need them — and to other countries where they need them.\\xa0 We’ve had — I’ve had about six calls with leaders of other countries, and they need them.\\xa0 And they’re hard to — they’re hard to get done.\\n\\nWe did — was our companies stepped up, and they did an incredible job.\\xa0 Some of them were automobile companies, and they’d take an assembly line and they’d say, “Guess what?\\xa0 We’re making ventilators now for a while.”\\n\\nBut because of the historic steps that we’ve taken, I remain confident that every American who needs any of this equipment — any of the things we’re talking about — we’ll either have it now, already has it, or we’ll shortly have it.\\n\\nThrough the Project Airbridge, we’ve completed 64 flights carrying over 600 million pieces of personal protective equipment, such as gloves, gowns, and other medical gear, with 50 more flights scheduled in the very near future.\\n\\nThe team doing that is an incredible team of military people and young geniuses.\\xa0 Some are older geniuses, but mostly younger geniuses, I think I can say.\\xa0 Some people that made vast amounts of money in Silicon Valley.\\xa0 You know, these are very smart people.\\xa0 The job they’ve done is incredible.\\xa0 And I said, “Where do you come from?”\\xa0 “Well, I sold my company, sir.”\\xa0 “Oh, really?\\xa0 How much did you get?”\\xa0 I think he said $700 million.\\xa0 I said, “That’s good.\\xa0 You want to work for the government?”\\xa0 No, I want to help our country, sir.\\xa0 And it’s tremendous brainpower.\\xa0 It’s a beautiful thing to see.\\n\\nYoung, incredible people that love this country, and they worked with the military.\\xa0 Admiral, you would say they were pretty smart, right?\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 Yes, sir,\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They were in the upper scales of IQ?\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They were the upper.\\xa0 They were the — they were the top scale, I’ll tell you.\\xa0 And they’re great people.\\n\\nBut FEMA is working to commit another $384 million to produce another 64 million gowns for healthcare.\\xa0 These are the highest quality, where they’re very safe.\\xa0 When you put them on, they’re safe.\\xa0 Very important.\\xa0 The quality of the gown is very important.\\xa0 People in different places, different countries, they’re wearing gowns with cuts in them.\\xa0 And these are very safe.\\n\\nI want to thank America’s textile manufacturers for their partnership in this remarkable undertaking.\\xa0 Two U.S. companies, Hanes and Standard Textile, are on track to produce 5 million gowns by the end of the month.\\xa0 And that’s really moving.\\xa0 That’s really moving.\\xa0 Two great companies.\\xa0 You know those companies.\\n\\nAnother great American company, Honeywell, recently began manufacturing N95 masks in Rhode Island, where they converted a factory in less than five weeks instead of the nine months it was normally expected to take.\\xa0 So they’ve already done it, and they did it so rapidly.\\xa0 Five weeks instead of nine months.\\n\\nIt’s amazing the spirit of this country.\\xa0 It’s really about the spirit of the country.\\xa0 We said, “Do it.\\xa0 Do it fast.”\\xa0 But they did it in — and this is — this was a major conversion too.\\xa0 This is a different world.\\n\\nHoneywell is hiring more than 1,000 American workers to produce 20 million masks per month.\\xa0 Twenty million masks a month.\\xa0 Thanks to the Defense Production Act, we’ll be receiving another 40 million masks over the next few weeks.\\n\\nAnd I also want to thank 3M because they really stepped up.\\xa0 We had a little dispute at the beginning, but that got worked out quickly, and they’ve been doing a great job — 3M.\\xa0 They really have been.\\xa0 I want to thank their great CEO.\\xa0 We — we had a little skirmish, but it worked out well.\\xa0 And they’re doing a lot of work right now on masks and other things.\\n\\nThis production is in addition to the 55 million N95 masks my administration has already distributed.\\xa0 Plus, we ordered — and it’s coming in soon — 500 million masks.\\xa0 You would think, “What are you going to do with them?”\\xa0 They get used rapidly.\\n\\nIn addition to that, as you know, we sterilize masks now.\\xa0 A great company in Ohio recommended by the governor of Ohio, strongly.\\xa0 And it’s doing very well, and they’re sterilizing.\\xa0 A lot of the masks can be sterilized up to 20 times, so that’s like buying 20 masks.\\xa0 And I always wondered, “Why aren’t they sterilizing these masks?”\\xa0 They’re pretty — some of them are pretty sophisticated masks.\\xa0 And some you can’t, because of the material; others you can.\\n\\nBut we have actually two companies that do this, but one company I know very well in Ohio, and they’re doing a great job.\\xa0 So they’re sterilizing masks.\\xa0 Up to 20 times you can sterilize a certain type of mask.\\n\\nTo these numbers in perspective — and to put them into perspective, American healthcare providers use an estimated 25 million N95 masks nationwide in a typical year.\\xa0 So, a typical year: 25 million.\\xa0 That means we’ve secured nearly four times as many N95 masks in recent weeks as we would an entire healthcare industry during a typical year.\\xa0 Over a matter of a couple of weeks, we had more masks than we would do in a year.\\xa0 Think of that.\\xa0 Over a couple of weeks.\\n\\nMoreover, we’re bringing supply chains back home, and we’ve learned a lot about supply chains.\\xa0 We’ve learned that it’s nice to make things in the U.S.\\xa0 I’ve been saying that for a long time.\\xa0 One of the reasons I ran for office — because we started making things everywhere but here.\\xa0 And if one thing comes out of this, more than anything else, is that we should make product in the United States.\\n\\nAnd these supply chains, they sound wonderful, but if one country has a problem, the whole chain is ruined.\\xa0 And I’ve been saying it for a long time.\\xa0 I ran partially on that.\\xa0 I ran partially on that.\\xa0 I ran on that, and I ran very strongly against China.\\xa0 And then we made a great trade deal where they buy $250 billion.\\xa0 They’re supposed to.\\xa0 And they’re paying tariffs.\\xa0 They paid us tens of billions of dollars.\\xa0 I’ve given $12 billion one year, $16 billion another year, and $19 billion to our farmers and ranchers who were targeted.\\n\\nBut, you know, I ran on China and other countries, the way they were ripping us off.\\xa0 They were ripping off our country.\\xa0 And China understood that.\\xa0 I mean, China fully understood that.\\xa0 And they’re big, strong, smart people.\\xa0 And I wasn’t friendly, and it wasn’t a friendly situation.\\xa0 And we ended up making an incredible deal with China for tens of billions of dollars of product: $40- to $50 billion to the farmers.\\xa0 The most they ever spent was 15 to 16; now they’re supposed to spend 40 to 50.\\n\\nNow, of course, the — the virus came along, and I’m not happy.\\xa0 I’m not happy.\\xa0 And I let him know I’m not happy.\\xa0 So, you know, we had a great relationship with — we had a very bad relationship with China.\\xa0 Then we had a good relationship, because we made a great deal.\\n\\nBut we’re not happy.\\xa0 This is not a good thing that happened.\\xa0 It came out of China, so we’re not — we’re not in a position where we’re going to say much yet.\\n\\nBut the deal itself is great.\\xa0 The deal is — it’s going to put many, many people to work in our country.\\xa0 But all of that has to be taken into account when you look at all of the people that are dying in our country, but all over the world — all over the world.\\xa0 People are dying.\\n\\nI had a G7 call and their economies are in tatters.\\xa0 They’re shattered, the G7 countries.\\xa0 You have Japan and Germany and France, and the different countries.\\xa0 Italy — look at what happened to Italy.\\xa0 Look at what happened to these countries.\\xa0 Look at what happened to Spain.\\xa0 Look what happened to Spain, how — how incredible.\\xa0 It’s just been shattered.\\xa0 And so many other countries are shattered.\\n\\nSo nobody ever thought this could have happened, a thing like this.\\xa0 It’s very, very sad.\\n\\nBut if we’ve learned something, it’s about supply chains.\\xa0 I just saw yesterday where, when the auto industry gets back, they have a problem because there’s a supply chain going through a different country.\\xa0 And this has been going on over for years, for decades.\\xa0 I always said it was no good.\\xa0 Why don’t — why don’t we make it — why do you need a supply chain?\\xa0 Make — very simple: Make you parts here.\\xa0 They get one part from this country and one part from that country.\\xa0 It’s all over the place.\\xa0 The problem is if one country has a problem, you have no car, or whatever it is you’re making.\\n\\nSo we’ve learned a good lesson.\\xa0 I think a lot of smart people knew that before.\\xa0 But we’ve distributed many hundreds of millions of masks.\\n\\nThis pandemic has underscored the vital importance of reshoring our supply chains and bringing them back into the United States, where they belong, where they should have never left.\\xa0 What happens if you’re in a war and you have a supply chain where half of your supplies are given to you by other countries?\\xa0 Who — who are the people that thought of this?\\xa0 These are globalists.\\xa0 It doesn’t work.\\xa0 It certainly doesn’t work during rough times, bad times, or dangerous times.\\n\\nSo we’re going to continue to fight the virus.\\xa0 We’re talking to China.\\xa0 We spoke to them a long time ago about going in.\\xa0 We want to go in; we want to see what’s going on.\\xa0 And we weren’t exactly invited, I can tell you that.\\n\\nIf you look at some of the investigations that are going on in terms of World Health Organization — and I’ll take it a step further: the World Trade Organization, too.\\xa0 World Trade.\\xa0 We — we did years ago — years ago, many years ago — the World Trade Organization.\\xa0 From the day China came in, that’s when China bloomed.\\xa0 They were mainlining it, and then, boom, they were up like a rocket ship because they took advantage of every little ridiculous clause in the World Trade Organization documents.\\n\\nThey were a developing nation.\\xa0 China was a developing nation.\\xa0 They make the cars.\\xa0 They make the plant.\\xa0 They make everything.\\xa0 They make everything.\\xa0 And they’re a developing nation.\\n\\nSo we’ve had — I might have gotten elected, to a certain extent, because of China and other countries.\\xa0 One of my big things was trade.\\xa0 The United States is getting ripped off on trade.\\n\\nNow Japan is paying $40 billion and buying a lot.\\xa0 That’s before we even do the deal.\\xa0 U.S.-Mexico was a great deal.\\xa0 The NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made in trade — in trade history.\\xa0 And I would also put the World Trade Organization in that same group.\\n\\nSo I was very tough on these countries.\\xa0 With China, we made the deal, and we became friendly.\\xa0 But then this happened, and this is — this is tantamount.\\xa0 This is something that’s really incredible.\\n\\nI do want to read the — something that I just saw today on television.\\xa0 I was looking and I just said, “That’s an interesting statement.”\\xa0 We talked about the Democrats, and it was a statement made by Bret Baier — a good guy, smart.\\xa0 “On February 19, there was a Democratic debate in Las Vegas.”\\xa0 That was February 19.\\xa0 That’s way after I closed entrance from China into our country.\\n\\nSo, Bret goes: “On February 19, there was a Democratic debate in Las Vegas.\\xa0 Three words weren’t said during the debate: virus, coronavirus, or COVID-19.\\xa0 Those three words never came up.”\\n\\nThat was — I just thought it was very interesting, because, you know, you hear these people — some of the people — the Democrats said “Oh, this, that.”\\xa0 It never even was a part of their dialogue.\\xa0 Now they bring it up because you see what happened.\\xa0 So now — but they didn’t bring it up, but I brought it up.\\xa0 I brought it up a long time before I made the trade deal.\\xa0 And I was not easy to deal with.\\xa0 I was not easy to deal with.\\xa0 They understand that.\\n\\nWe still have 25 percent on $250 billion that they have to pay us.\\xa0 And it’s a lot of money.\\xa0 We’ve taken in a lot of money, and we’ve had a lot of beneficiaries, including our farmers and ranchers.\\n\\nSo, in addition, we’ve launched an unprecedented effort to develop new treatments and therapies to battle the plague.\\xa0 Therapies, to me, are the most exciting.\\xa0 The vaccines are obviously so important, but the therapies are immediate, you know.\\xa0 And we have some things that are really looking good.\\xa0 Really looking good.\\xa0 We call it: COVID Treatment Acceleration Program.\\xa0 We’re accelerating all of these great companies that are looking, and we have government agencies looking too — NIH.\\n\\nThis extraordinary program is slashing red tape to speed in development and to rival and — if you look at — if you look at what we’re doing in terms of the speed, it’s unrivaled.\\xa0 It’s totally unrivaled.\\xa0 There’s never been anything like it.\\xa0 The FDA and Dr. Stephen Hahn — a highly respected man from a great institution — left that job to come here.\\xa0 The job he’s doing is incredible.\\xa0 And we’re working with Scott, his predecessor, who’s terrific.\\xa0 We’re working with a lot of people.\\n\\nBut the speed of development for antiviral, antibody, and immune therapies is at a level that nobody thought even possible.\\xa0 And I will say this: We’re getting very good results.\\xa0 It’s a little soon yet.\\xa0 But if we could find the therapies, that would solve the problem.\\xa0 If somebody has a problem, we can get it taken care of, so it’s not so devastating as it has been.\\n\\nWith that, I’m going to ask Vice President Pence to come up.\\xa0 And I have to say it’s a Sunday — a Sunday evening — and this man has not stopped.\\xa0 He’s working — we all are, in all fairness — but he’s been working with his task force and everyone else around the clock for months.\\n\\nAnd I just want to thank Mike.\\xa0 Thank you, Mike.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 And let me echo your words about all the dedicated men and women on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, and the team that you assembled in January, some of whom are with us today: Seema Verma with CMS, Admiral Giroir with the U.S. Public Health Service, Dr. Steve Hahn of the FDA, and others represent a level of commitment and dedication.\\xa0 It’s been inspiring for me to have the privilege to work with.\\xa0 And so I thank you for your gracious words.\\n\\nThat White House Coronavirus Task Force met today.\\xa0 It was reported to us that, at this moment, more than 746,000 Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus.\\xa0 Fortunately, more than 68,000 Americans have fully recovered.\\xa0 But sadly, more than 41,000 Americans have lost their lives to the coronavirus.\\n\\nAnd we always want to express our deepest sympathies to the families in their loss, as well as to all the families who have loved ones that are struggling with this disease.\\n\\nToday, we’ve seen encouraging news again about our progress as a nation.\\xa0 President Trump reflected on those momentarily.\\xa0 But the coronavirus White House Task Force today learned that our large metro areas continue to stabilize and even see progress.\\n\\nThe New York metro area, including New Jersey, New York, Long Island, Connecticut, and Rhode Island all appear to be past their peak.\\xa0 The Detroit metro area also appears to be past its peak and is stable. \\xa0New Orleans metro area actually is the most stable of all areas where we had a major metropolitan outbreak.\\xa0 And the Denver metro area is stable.\\xa0 We’re dealing in Colorado with a meatpacking plant issue.\\xa0 And, of course, California and Washington remain low and steady.\\n\\nAreas that we continue to watch carefully on the task force include the Chicago metro area, Boston metro, and the Philadelphia metropolitan area.\\n\\nThe progress that we are making is a tribute to the — the American people.\\xa0 It’s a tribute to state and local leaders in all of these areas and the partnership that our President has forged.\\n\\nBut we just want to encourage every American, as we see this progress, to continue to heed your state and local authorities.\\xa0 I think the American people know no one wants to reopen America more than President Donald Trump.\\xa0 But I want to assure you we’re going to continue to work with governors of every state, with the President’s Guidelines for Opening Up America Again.\\xa0 And we’re going to work in a way that we can consolidate the progress that we have made and help move our states toward reopening our country.\\n\\nWe also received a report today — and the coronavirus task force, at this point: 5,528 military personnel have been deployed across 24 hospitals and facilities, and 28,700 National Guard are on duty.\\n\\nOn the subject of supplies, the President spoke about this at length, but at the present moment, we have more than 9,055 ventilators on hand.\\xa0 We actually added 91 ventilators to that supply because of the production that the President and our task force at FEMA has activated.\\xa0 And in the next seven days, we’ll be adding 576 ventilators to the Strategic National Stockpile.\\n\\nAs the President mentioned, our Airbridge continues to work: 64 flights completed, with 50 more flights on the horizon, literally bringing in medical equipment from around the country and around the world and deploying it to critical areas.\\n\\nFinally, tomorrow, as the President announced, we’ll be hosting a conference call with all of the nation’s governors, all the states and territories, from the headquarters at FEMA.\\xa0 And we’ll be working with the governors to ensure them that we’re — we’re helping them to review and evaluate the President’s Guidelines for Opening Up America Again — the criteria that we believe is appropriate and necessary — before states can move into any phase one change in the mitigation strategies.\\n\\nBut also, at the President’s direction tomorrow, we’ll be providing all the nation’s governors and all of their health officials with detail about the testing infrastructure that exists all around the country.\\xa0 We’ll be specifically providing governors and state health officials with information about all of the lab capability that exists in their states.\\xa0 And also, we’ll be updating them on our efforts to identify the kind of supplies the President just held up in our efforts to make sure that those supplies are at — at all of those laboratories, as the need should arise.\\n\\nRemember that, a month ago, we had done 80,000 coronavirus tests in America.\\xa0 This weekend, we cleared more than 4 million.\\xa0 And we’re currently testing more than a million Americans a week.\\xa0 We fully expect to actually have tested more than 5 million Americans before the end of this month.\\n\\nBut at the President’s urging, we’re going to continue to scale that testing and then work with governors to make sure that they can manage and implement and deploy that testing in the manner that will most support their efforts to move their states forward.\\n\\nRemember that the testing that is contemplated in the Guidelines for Opening Up America Again, for phase one, are testing people that have symptoms that may be coronavirus, and then also having the testing resources to deploy to vulnerable communities: nursing homes or other vulnerable communities that we have identified as needing additional –what is called “monitoring” or “surveillance testing.\\n\\nWe believe we have the testing today around the country that would allow any state in America to move into phase one if they’ve met the other criteria: fourteen days of consistent declines and strong hospital capacity, so that their system would not be overwhelmed in the event of a flare-up.\\n\\nBut we’re going to be working with governors tomorrow on the subject of testing and supplies.\\xa0 And as the President said again this evening:\\xa0We’re here to help.\\xa0 We’ve forged a partnership with governors around the country, and tomorrow we’ll be building on that partnership to hopefully arrive at the day that we can make sure governors around the nation have the best advice and the best resources to put America back to work.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Very good.\\n\\nIs Seema here?\\xa0 Seema, you’ve done such a great job.\\xa0 Please, come up and say a couple of words.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nADMINISTRATOR VERMA:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President and Mr. President.\\xa0 So, just a few weeks ago, we stood here and asked the American healthcare system to delay elective surgeries and procedures.\\xa0 And the reason why we did this is we wanted to make sure that the healthcare system could deal with any surges.\\xa0 We wanted to preserve equipment and make sure that they had the appropriate workforce to handle any surge.\\xa0 And our healthcare system did a fantastic job.\\xa0 They very quickly stood up telehealth services.\\xa0 And under the President’s leadership, we started paying for these services under the Medicare program.\\n\\nBut the reality is, not everything can be addressed by telehealth.\\xa0 And maybe a woman that needs surgery for breast cancer, somebody who has cataracts in their eyes that need to be able to see better, and sometimes the doctor just needs to be able to listen to their patient’s heart.\\xa0 We’ve heard across the country that doctors’ offices have closed and many healthcare systems are furloughing their staff, nurses and doctors.\\n\\nUnder the President’s leadership, we’ve put out over $90 billion in accelerated payments under the Medicare program, provided $30 billion of grants, with more dollars on the way.\\n\\nBut thanks to the American people, we are in a much different place.\\xa0 You heard from the Vice President that there are many places around the country where they’re seeing a decline in cases.\\xa0 And hospitals are reporting that they have unused capacity.\\n\\nAnd so, as part of our opening up America, we are issuing guidelines today about how we can reopen the healthcare system.\\xa0 So these are recommendations around phase one.\\n\\nNow, every state and local official has to assess the situation on the ground.\\xa0 They need to make sure that they can still address surges.\\xa0 They need to make sure that they have adequate supplies and a plan for conserving supplies.\\xa0 They need to be able to screen patients and healthcare workers for COVID virus.\\xa0 And they need to make sure that patients feel safe when they come in to seek healthcare services by assuring that they have the appropriate cleaning in place and that they observe social distancing inside the healthcare facilities.\\n\\nAnd this isn’t going to be like a light switch.\\xa0 It’s more like a sunrise, where it’s going to be a gradual process.\\xa0 And healthcare officials across the country and healthcare systems need to decide what services should be made available.\\xa0 And, ultimately, doctors and patients need to make decisions about their healthcare services.\\xa0 And we want to make sure that systems are reopening so that they can stay open and doing that in a very measured way.\\n\\nAnd I want to thank all the healthcare workers on the frontlines.\\xa0 They have done a fantastic job in providing care and comfort, serving as the liaison between family members.\\xa0 They’ve done a fantastic job, and we owe a debt of gratitude to them.\\n\\nAnd to all those providers that did adhere to our guidelines: They did the right thing, and it has made an extraordinary difference.\\n\\nI also want to take a couple of seconds here to talk about our nursing homes.\\xa0 Our hearts and minds are with the patients and the families of those living in nursing homes.\\xa0 This is an extraordinarily difficult situation.\\xa0 People living in nursing homes are of the most vulnerable patients: They’re elderly; many of them have underlying health conditions.\\xa0 And this has been a very hard situation, and I really appreciate the strong efforts of governors and local communities that have shown great leadership in supporting nursing homes across the country, particularly Governor Baker, Governor Hogan, that have had special efforts around supporting nursing homes.\\n\\nFEMA is also working on a plan to make sure that nursing homes have the supplies that they need.\\xa0 And just last week, we increased the reimbursement in the Medicare program for high-throughput tests, and we are also paying for labs to go out to nursing homes to collect samples.\\xa0 And that’s going to really support efforts on nursing homes in order to isolate patients.\\n\\nToday, we are also announcing, under the President’s leadership, an effort around nursing home transparency.\\xa0 It’s important that patients and their families have the information that they need, and they need to understand what’s going on in the nursing home.\\n\\nAnd so, today, we are announcing that we are requiring nursing homes to report to patients and their families if there are cases of COVID virus inside the nursing home.\\xa0 We are also requiring nursing homes to report directly to the CDC when they have cases of COVID virus.\\n\\nAnd this is very important.\\xa0 As you’ve heard Dr. Birx talk about, as we reopen the United States, our surveillance effort around the COVID virus will also begin in nursing homes.\\xa0 And so by having this reporting system, this will support CDC’s efforts to have surveillance around the country and to support efforts around contact tracing so that we can mitigate the spread of the virus in those communities that show spread starting in the nursing homes.\\n\\nSo again, I want to thank all of the local officials that have done an amazing job in supporting the nursing homes, and would urge all state and local leaders to follow their lead and do everything that we can to keep nursing home residents safe.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much, Seema.\\n\\nAnd Dr. Hahn is here.\\xa0 If you need, he’ll tell you maybe a little bit later, if you want this — but I can tell you that, very simply: The level at which they are approving things, tests, and being on top of the people that are doing the testing for therapies and for vaccines has never — they’ve never seen anything like this.\\xa0 So I want to thank you very much.\\xa0 And stick around.\\xa0 Maybe they’ll have some questions.\\n\\nOkay?\\xa0 Please, go ahead.\\xa0 In the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, thank you very much.\\xa0 If there were groups of people planning to protest tomorrow against the government shutdown, what would be your advice?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Against the shutdown?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, yeah.\\xa0 That they want the shutdown lifted.\\xa0 Should they go ahead if it’s in —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They want it lifted?\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — a state where there haven’t been 14 days —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 I don’t have any advice.\\xa0 People feel that way.\\xa0 You’re allowed to protest.\\xa0 I mean, they — they feel that way.\\n\\nI watched a protest and they were all six feet apart.\\xa0 I mean, it was a very orderly group of people.\\xa0 But, you know, some — some have gone too far.\\xa0 Some governors have gone too far.\\xa0 Some of the things that happened are maybe not so appropriate.\\n\\nAnd I think, in the end, it’s not going to matter because we’re starting to open up our states.\\xa0 And I think they’re going to open up very well.\\xa0 We’re going to be watching it.\\xa0 We’re going to be watching it very closely.\\xa0 We’re working with them on testing.\\xa0 We’re working with them on whatever they need.\\xa0 I don’t think they need ventilators anymore.\\n\\nI believe the term the governor used was “phenomenal.”\\xa0 We’ve done a phenomenal job.\\xa0 That was the term that — that was the only sentence they left out, which is okay.\\xa0 But I — I appreciate that that’s what Governor Cuomo said.\\xa0 But we have — they’ve done a phenomenal — these people have done a phenomenal job.\\n\\nAs far as protesters — you know, I see protesters for all sorts of things.\\xa0 And I’m with everybody.\\xa0 I’m with everybody.\\n\\nPlease, in the back.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 In the back.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Are you ready?\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, please.\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Jenn Pellegrino with OAN.\\xa0 Yesterday, you pointed out that Iran was likely not truthful in their reporting of the virus.\\xa0 Meanwhile, Senator Dianne Feinstein and other Democrats are looking for $5 billion in aid to Iran.\\xa0 Are you considering giving any aid to Iran?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 If Iran needed aid on this, I would be willing to do something, if they want it.\\xa0 If they’d ask for it, I would be certainly willing.\\xa0 They were hit very hard.\\xa0 Obviously, those numbers weren’t correct numbers that they reported.\\xa0 But if they needed help, if they needed aid, if they needed ventilators — we have thousands of ventilators currently on hand, and ventilators under construction, under — that are under construction.\\n\\nThat’s a mosquito.\\xa0 I don’t like mosquitoes.\\xa0 I don’t like mosquitoes at all.\\n\\nBut if they — yeah, we would certainly be willing to help.\\xa0 What they should do is be smart and make a deal.\\n\\nIt’s only because of — you know, you look at what happened.\\xa0 It’s — John Kerry, I guess, just doesn’t want them to make a deal.\\xa0 And they’re probably figuring they can wait and maybe it will be Biden.\\xa0 And they’ll own America if Biden gets — and they know, with me, doesn’t work that way.\\xa0 It doesn’t work that way.\\xa0 If — if Joe Biden got in, they’d own America.\\xa0 Between them, China, Japan, Mexico, Canada, they’d own America.\\xa0 You wouldn’t have a country left if he got in.\\n\\nGo ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, the first question: You mentioned that you’ve seen some governors — I think you said this yesterday too — that some governors, you think, have gone too far.\\xa0 Which governors are you referring to, sir?\\xa0 Which states?\\xa0 And then —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t want to mention — I don’t want to mention names specifically.\\xa0 But obviously, one we can mention that’s this, but really much beyond this, is Virginia with what they’ve done on guns.\\xa0 He is playing with your Second Amendment.\\xa0 We can’t allow that to happen.\\xa0 And that is indirectly related to this, because you know what’s happened with guns.\\xa0 People are buying guns at a level that you haven’t seen before because of — because of this surge of — of plague.\\xa0 So what he did was totally inappropriate.\\n\\nOther than that, I’m not going to mention governors.\\xa0 But I have a list: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On money, sir, you mentioned at the top that you hope that a deal may come tomorrow on the small-business loan program.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I hope so.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But, you know, this morning, Mnuchin seemed like this was ready to go.\\xa0 It seem like any second now.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I don’t know.\\xa0 Whatever it is, they’re —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is there any — is there any changes there?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You know, every time you say it’s ready to go, then they say, “Oh, we have a good negotiating position now because he just said it’s ready to go.\\xa0 So now…”\\xa0 Let’s see what happens.\\n\\nBut we want to put our — we want to take care of our workers.\\xa0 We want to take care of our small businesses.\\xa0 They’re really the engine of this country.\\xa0 We have to take — when we open, we want to have those small businesses ready to go.\\xa0 We don’t want to — we don’t want those businesses abandoned because they couldn’t afford their employees, they couldn’t take care.\\xa0 And I want to take care of those employees.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But what’s the hold-up now, sir?\\xa0 Just in terms of this —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I can’t tell you that.\\xa0 I can just tell you that we’re negotiating with the Democrats.\\xa0 And, you know, they negotiate for things that we can’t do, that we don’t think are in the best interest of the people of this country.\\xa0 We are very close to a deal.\\xa0 I can’t tell you whether or not we’re going to get the deal or not.\\n\\nWho would say that?\\xa0 You want me to say we — we’re going to have a deal before we have a deal?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But for people with businesses and —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We have a good chance of getting a deal.\\xa0 A lot of good discussions were had today.\\xa0 And we have a good chance of getting the deal.\\xa0 We want the deal.\\xa0 We want to take care of our workers, and we want to take care of our small companies.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 I have a question for you and also for Dr. Hahn, if I may, after I get to your question.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 In your remarks that you made just a few moments ago, in regards to reopening the U.S. economy, you said, “I want it to be safe.”\\xa0 And that’s a sentiment, obviously, shared by —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I do.\\xa0 No, I want it to be safe.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — tens of millions of Americans.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I want it to be safe.\\xa0 Absolutely.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And it seems at odds, Mr. President, with the tweet that you had on Friday about liberating those three particular states — Virginia, Minnesota, and Michigan — because none of those states, Mr. President, have met the requirements that the Vice President and others on the task force have talked about, in terms of reopening the economy.\\xa0 Do you see those two —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, if you take the — if you take —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — ideas at odds?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — Michigan, there were things in the Michigan that I don’t think they were necessary or appropriate.\\xa0 Everyone knows that.\\xa0 I think the governor of Michigan — and we’re getting along very well, but I think the governor of Michigan probably knows that.\\xa0 I think she probably wished she didn’t put some of them in.\\xa0 You can’t buy paint.\\xa0 You can’t buy seeds.\\xa0 You can’t have — I mean, where did this stuff come from?\\n\\nNo, no — we’re going to be safe.\\xa0 We have to be safe.\\xa0 And we don’t want to close anything.\\xa0 We’re not going to be closing.\\xa0 But we’re going to be doing it beautifully, systematically.\\xa0 We’re working very well with the governors.\\xa0 I mean, I would say, pretty much almost all of them.\\xa0 A couple of them, no matter what you do, you’ll never satisfy them.\\xa0 You could — you could find the cure tomorrow and they wouldn’t be satisfied.\\xa0 They’d find a reason to complain.\\xa0 Wise guys.\\n\\nBut, for the most part, we’re working very well with the governors.\\xa0 We have a great relationship with the governors.\\n\\nI can tell you, I’ve been on numerous calls with governors, and during those calls — I mean, without exception, they were friendly.\\xa0 And that’s going back even a month — a month from today.\\n\\nSo I think that we’re going to do a terrific job.\\xa0 I think the governors are going to do a terrific job.\\xa0 And we’re starting to open our country.\\xa0 And, you know, as you know, some — I just spoke with Greg Abbott today, from Texas.\\xa0 He’s fantastic.\\xa0 He’s a fantastic governor.\\xa0 And he’s going to be opening up parts of Texas.\\xa0 And you’re going to be opening up parts of other countries.\\xa0 You know what they — other states.\\xa0 And you know what that is.\\n\\nAnd, by the way, other countries are at a point where they’re starting.\\xa0 I see where Germany is starting to open up a little section.\\n\\nSo there are a lot of great things happening, and we’re going to start to open our country.\\xa0 And we’re going to do it — it’s like — as they say, it’s like a beautiful puzzle.\\xa0 The state — it might even be a portion of a state.\\xa0 You know, there are states — very big states, and you can have portions of states, Mike.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Counties.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You have a portion — you have a county, which is perfect, and you have another county that’s sort of still pretty far away, even if it’s within the same state, and it’s not doing so well.\\xa0 But they may open a part.\\n\\nSo we’re going to do it very, very carefully.\\xa0 And I think it’s going to be very successful.\\xa0 But when you say safe, I want it to be very safe.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 For Dr. Hahn — Mr. President, for Dr. Hahn.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, thank you very much.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 May I ask a question of Dr. Hahn?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Let him — let him just do this one.\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you very much, Dr. Hahn.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Doctor.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There’s a question that I don’t know the answer to and I was hoping that you could provide an answer to.\\xa0 There’s an epidemiologist at the University of Alabama, in Birmingham, who’s actually a COVID-19 survivor, and his name is Michael Saag.\\xa0 And his question is this: Why would the virus suddenly be different?\\xa0 Why would people’s susceptibility be any different on May the 1st, or on June the 1st, or on July 1st?\\xa0 And this all relates to reopening the economy.\\xa0 Can you explain or give an answer to that particular question?\\n\\nDR. HAHN:\\xa0 I don’t think we have evidence that one would be more susceptible or less.\\xa0 What I think we can say is that the mitigation efforts have really helped with respect to this, and that what we’ve seen is the number of cases have gone down.\\xa0 And if we follow the gating criteria for the opening, we’re then able to institute phase one and have the appropriate measures in place to actually reduce any chance of flare-up of the cases.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is there a chance of a sort of rebounding if you reopen too soon without the type of mitigation efforts that we’ve had still in place?\\n\\nDR. HAHN:\\xa0 Yes, there’s a chance.\\xa0 And I think Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx talked about this at the podium.\\xa0 And the key here is the surveillance that is being put in place with the CDC.\\xa0 I think that’ll be a really great help in terms of trying to reduce that risk.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And I think they have the rest of that clip.\\xa0 I just thought it was a very good clip.\\xa0 I think it’s a tribute to New York.\\xa0 I think it’s a tribute to the federal government.\\xa0 And I thought it was nice.\\xa0 So I think they have that now.\\xa0 They can try it.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\n(A video is played.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Ummm —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you had called on me.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 I did.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, I appreciate it.\\xa0 Since you shared with us something else that you saw on TV today, I have a question about something you said on Thursday, which is that you were “angry” because information about the virus “should have been told to us” earlier and “a lot sooner.”\\xa0 “People knew it was happening, and people did not want to talk about it.”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Many Americans are saying the exact same thing about you, that you should have warned them the virus was spreading like wildfire through the month of February, instead of holding rallies with thousands of people.\\xa0 Why did you wait so long —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, who are you with?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — to warn them?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Who — who are you with?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And why did you not —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — have social distancing until March 16th?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Who are you with?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m Weijia Jiang with CBS News.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So if you look at what I did in terms of cutting off or banning China from coming in —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Chinese nationals.\\xa0 But, by the way, not Americans who were —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Nice and easy.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — also coming in from China.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Nice and easy.\\xa0 Just relax.\\n\\nWe cut it off.\\xa0 People were amazed.\\xa0 These gentlemen, everybody was amazed that I did it.\\xa0 We had 21 people in a room; everybody was against it but me.\\xa0 Dr. Fauci said, had I not done that, perhaps tens of thousands — and maybe much more than that — people would have died.\\xa0 I was very early.\\xa0 Very, very early.\\n\\nAnd we just saw — you saw Bret Baier making a statement.\\xa0 They had a debate well into February and not even mentioned — it wasn’t even mentioned — the Democrats.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And you’re the President, sir —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We were very early.\\xa0 Oh, I — I’m the President.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and you didn’t warn people that it was —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And you what I just did?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — spreading so quickly.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And you know what I just —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And, by the way, when you issued the ban, the virus was already here.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 And you know how many people — when I used the ban — how many cases of virus were in the United States when I issued the ban?\\xa0 Do you know the number?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There was — there were already —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no — how many cases?\\xa0 Remember, I said, “one person.”\\xa0 How many cases were here when I issued the ban?\\xa0 Tell me.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But did you know that it was going to spread and become a pandemic?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no, no, you have to do your research.\\xa0 How many —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I did my research.\\xa0 On the 23rd of March, you said you knew this was going to be a pandemic well —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Can I tell you what?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — before the WHO.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I did know it.\\xa0 I did know it.\\xa0 All I have to do is look.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you know it was going to spread.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 All — anybody knew it.\\xa0 Just — are you ready?\\xa0 How many cases were in the United States when I did my ban?\\xa0 How many people had died in the United States?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So do you acknowledge that you didn’t think it was —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Keep your voice down, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — going to spread?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Keep your voice down.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Did you not think it was going to spread?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 How many — how many — how many cases were in the United States?\\xa0 I did a ban where I’m closing up the entire country.\\xa0 How many people died?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And that’s a fair point.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 How many people died in the United States?\\xa0 And yet I closed up the country, and I believe there were no deaths — zero deaths — at the time I closed up the country.\\xa0 Nobody was there.\\xa0 And you should say “thank you very much” for good judgment.\\n\\nGo ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you just mentioned Germany.\\xa0 Germany is allowing the small stores to open tomorrow.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes, they are.\\xa0 I just spoke to them.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Does this give you confidence that some European countries are on the mend of recovery?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I hope so.\\xa0 I mean —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And will you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — we hope it works out.\\xa0 Look, I spoke to —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Will you lift some restrictions on them?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I spoke with Angela.\\xa0 I spoke with Angela.\\xa0 And they’re going to start a process of opening, very much like we are.\\xa0 We are too.\\n\\nI spoke with numerous governors; they’re doing it also.\\xa0 Areas that have been — that were — number one, they’ve done a good job and where they don’t have much of a problem.\\n\\nGermany is starting the process also, yes.\\xa0 And I’m very happy about that.\\xa0 Some places in Europe, as you know, can’t start the process for a while.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes, ma’am.\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 I have two Nevada questions.\\xa0 First one: The mayor of Las Vegas thinks it’s “total insanity” for business to be shut down in Nevada, which the Governor, Sisolak, ordered.\\xa0 Who’s right?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they shut one of my hotels down too.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 So, you know —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I am well aware.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m not involved in that.\\xa0 I couldn’t be if I wanted to, I just chose not to be.\\xa0 By the way, just so you know, I could be if I wanted to, but I chose not.\\xa0 But they closed a very big hotel that I have in Nevada, down in Las Vegas.\\n\\nIt’s a very severe step he took.\\xa0 I’m okay with it.\\xa0 I’m okay with it.\\xa0 But, you know — I mean, you could call that one either way.\\xa0 I know the mayor is very upset with it.\\xa0 Some owners are very upset with it.\\xa0 Some of the developers out there very upset.\\xa0 Others, they say, “Hey, we got to get rid of it.”\\xa0 I can — I can see both sides of that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And I’d like to follow up with one other question.\\xa0 I asked you recently about an SBA rule that said the Paycheck Protection money could not go to small casinos.\\xa0 You said you’d look into it.\\xa0 Clearly, something happened.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They are looking into it right now because they — they do have — you know, they have small casinos that don’t have too many people.\\xa0 And they are looking, and they’re going to make a ruling, I understand, next week.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 They already did make a ruling, and they changed it from small casinos that make more than a third of their income couldn’t qualify, to half.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I know, but they’re looking at that.\\xa0 They’re continuing to look at that.\\xa0 It’s a big — it’s a big topic.\\xa0 Got a lot of people involved.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Let’s give it a shot.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 You know, Governor Cuomo, as you played in that clip, has indeed praised a lot of what the federal government has done, but he and —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0No — excuse me.\\xa0 Excuse me.\\xa0 He didn’t say “a lot.”\\xa0 He said we did a phenomenal job.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But let me say, he —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He didn’t say “a lot.”\\xa0 He didn’t say, “You did a good job on ventilators but nothing else.”\\xa0 No, he said we did a phenomenal job.\\xa0 So, report accurately, because you are one of the most inaccurate reporters.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What he has said is that — and along with a bunch of Republican governors who have said what they need, though, is a national strategy when it comes to testing.\\xa0 Because on supplies, they say —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I know.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — that they’re competing against one another.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I know.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Why not —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They said the same thing with ventilators, and now we have so many that we’re going to be able to send them and help other countries that are in need.\\xa0 We’re doing great on testing.\\xa0 And we are, actually, using the Act, as you know, on a certain company.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On swabs.\\xa0 But what about on the reagents?\\xa0 They say that that’s something that they can’t get a hold of.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We have — we’re in great shape.\\xa0 It’s so easy to get.\\xa0 Reagents and swabs are so easy to get.\\xa0 When you have to build a very expensive piece of machinery controlled by computers, that’s a different thing.\\xa0 And, no, we’ll have — everything is going to be in very good shape, very soon.\\xa0 We’re going to be in very good shape, very soon.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, just the latest stimulus package: Will that have funding for states and local governments?\\xa0 Mister —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I don’t want to comment on it, but we will be saving that for another time.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Will you be willing to (inaudible)?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And I — and, by the way, some states and local governments need it.\\xa0 I’m the first one to admit that.\\xa0 We’re going to be saving that for another little bit of a later date.\\xa0 It will probably be our next negotiation.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But they do.\\xa0 I’m in favor of it, I will say.\\xa0 And I told the Republicans today.\\xa0 I had a — I think a great talk with Republican senators today, and all of them, I think.\\xa0 Just about all of them.\\xa0 And a conference call.\\xa0 And we are going to be — that’ll be a very big topic over the next couple of weeks.\\xa0 It’s very important.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And what is the administration doing to make sure that, you know, hotel chains and hedge funds do not access funds?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, that’s another one.\\xa0 Yeah — no, that’s another one.\\xa0 You have hotels that have big, massive buildings that are under-levered.\\xa0 But if you have no income at all coming out — no income at all — these hotels are — they go from under-levered to they have to be closed down.\\xa0 It’s a terrible thing.\\n\\nI don’t know that they’re working on that specific problem, but it’s a problem they should be talking about.\\xa0 I mean, you have people that own a hotel where they go from having a very successful hotel with, you know, many employees — thousands of people — to, all of a sudden, closing it down.\\n\\nI read where my wonderful place in Florida, in Miami — Doral — they had to let a lot of the employees go because it’s essentially closed.\\xa0 You can’t use it.\\xa0 You’re not — you can’t have the restaurants.\\xa0 You can’t have the — so, you know, you have to close it down.\\xa0 That’s a — that’s an example of many, many hotels are closing down throughout the country.\\xa0 And hopefully they’re going to be able to open up relatively quickly.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But the funds, sir, were specifically for small businesses.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Would you — would the administration make sure that that’s —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it depends how the hotel is considered.\\xa0 You know, is it owned by a big chain?\\xa0 But even if it’s owned by a big chain, that’s devastating.\\xa0 If they have 200 hotels in the country and they’re closed, and it’s not only in the country — remember this: This is all over the world.\\xa0 You know, if they have — they could have 2,000 hotels that are in other countries; they’re also closed.\\xa0 We’re in — we’re in better shape than most, when you think about it.\\n\\nSo I think we’re going to be looking at it.\\xa0 I think it’s a very big problem.\\xa0 And it’s a lot of people employed.\\n\\nYeah, here we go.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, 22 — more than 22 million Americans are currently unemployed —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — as a result of this.\\xa0 Today we hit the grim milestone of more than 40,000 Americans now having died from the coronavirus.\\xa0 Can you explain then why you come out here and you are reading clips and showing clips of praise for you and for your administration?\\xa0 Is this really the time for self-congratulations?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I will tell you this: What I’m doing is I’m standing up for the men and women that have done such an incredible job — not for me; for the men and women — admirals, Vice President, if I might.\\xa0 But all of the men and women, thousands — tens of thousands of them that built hospitals in New York and New Jersey and all over this country in record time.\\xa0 They’d throw up 1,000 beds in four days.\\xa0 I’m sticking up for those people.\\xa0 Those people have been incredible.\\xa0 I’m also sticking up for doctors and nurses and military doctors and nurses.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But the clips that you played and what you read earlier was praising you and your administration specifically —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 All I played today was Governor Cuomo —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Why is now the moment to do that, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — saying very positive things about the job the federal government has done.\\xa0 And those people —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On the day where more than 40,000 Americans have now died.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And those — those people have been just absolutely excoriated by some of the fake news, like you.\\xa0 You’re CNN; you’re fake news.\\n\\nAnd let me just tell you, they were excoriated by people like you that don’t know any better, because you don’t have the brains you were born with.\\xa0 You should be praising the people that have done a good job, not doing what you do.\\xa0 Even that question.\\n\\nSo just so you understand, if we didn’t —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The question is: “Why now, sir?”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — do a job —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The question is “why now,” not “why are you doing it,”\\xa0but why now?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’ll tell you why now.\\xa0 Are you ready?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Because these people are, right now, in hospitals.\\xa0 It’s dangerous.\\xa0 It’s going to a battlefield.\\xa0 And I want these people — I want you —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This wasn’t about hospital workers, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I want you and —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This wasn’t about the doctors.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s all about that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This was about you and your administration.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s not about me.\\xa0 No, nothing is about me.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 That was what you read.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Look — look, you’re never going to treat me fairly — many of you.\\xa0 And I understand that.\\xa0 I don’t even know — I got here with the worst, most unfair press treatment, they say, in the history of the United States for a President.\\xa0 They did say Abraham Lincoln had very bad treatment too.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, the Wall Street journal headline you just read has your name in it.\\xa0 It talks about “Trump remaking the playbook.”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, that’s a positive thing, because that’s an exercise in how to do it and what to do.\\xa0 And that’s good for the future.\\xa0 People can learn from that.\\xa0 But I want the men and women of this country that are in danger — the admirals and the generals that have done a job like they’ve never done before.\\xa0 They’re in war.\\xa0 We’re in war.\\xa0 You know, I call it the “invisible enemy.”\\xa0 That’s the war, and it’s a dangerous war.\\n\\nWe’re also at a level when you said “40,000 people” — and you’re right: almost 40,000 people.\\xa0 And —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 More than.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, “more than.”\\xa0 Okay, good.\\xa0 Correct me.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 We’re at 41,000.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good.\\xa0 Well, I’m really glad you corrected me, CNN.\\n\\nBut here’s the story.\\xa0 Let me just tell you something: If we didn’t do what we did, the 40,000 right now could be a million people.\\xa0 It could be a million people, not 40,000.\\xa0 It could be a million.\\n\\nWe’re tracking at much less than the lowest possible estimate.\\xa0 And that’s a great tribute to a number of people and a number of things.\\xa0 One of the things that it’s a tribute to is what’s taken place in this country with the American people, because they’ve gone inside.\\xa0 They’ve done it.\\xa0 They’ve done a job that nobody thought was possible.\\n\\nAnd, in fact, when they did the models, as they call them, nobody thought it was possible.\\xa0 They did models not based on this kind of success.\\n\\nI’ve seen New York streets, and I see it in the morning — I’ve watched, all my life, New York streets — and you can’t even see the pavement, there’s so many people.\\xa0 And you take a look this morning; you take a look — even on Friday morning, I looked at it, I saw it through a camera — there wasn’t a person on Fifth Avenue; there wasn’t a person on Madison Avenue.\\xa0 I’ve never seen anything like it.\\xa0 Because people have really listened to instructions, and they’ve listened to what we’ve had to say — and the professionals.\\xa0 They’ve listened.\\n\\nAnd those people — people should really give them a lot of credit, including people like you, because you just don’t have the sense to understand what’s going on.\\n\\nAll right.\\xa0 Yeah, please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Should publicly traded companies like Shake Shack and Quantum Corp and Ruth’s Chris — should they have access to the PPP program?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it would depend.\\xa0 It would depend.\\xa0 A lot of those — I don’t know much about any of those companies, but a lot of times, they’re owned by franchisees where they own one or two places, and, you know, they are small businesses.\\xa0 So a lot of that would — that would depend on what the formula is.\\n\\nBut again, many of those companies are — you know, they’re out — they’re franchisees.\\xa0 A franchisee could open up one of the places that you mentioned.\\xa0 And so, yeah, I would say that’s important, actually.\\xa0 That’s like a restaurant.\\n\\nGo ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You know, these — you referred to these protests earlier.\\xa0 You know, some of them are getting pretty intense and were actually getting some death threats to some governors who are reluctant to reopen.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You are, in the media?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No, the governors are getting death threats.\\xa0 You know, governors of Kentucky, Michigan, Virginia.\\xa0 They’re getting increased level of death threats.\\xa0 And are you concerned that your talk about liberation and the Second Amendment and all this stuff —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 No, no.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — are you inciting violence among a few people who are (inaudible)?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’ve seen the people.\\xa0 I’ve seen interviews of the people.\\xa0 These are great people.\\xa0 Look, they want to get — they call it “cabin fever.”\\xa0 You’ve heard the term.\\xa0 They’ve got cabin fever.\\xa0 They want to get back.\\xa0 They want their life back.\\xa0 Their life was taken away from them.\\n\\nAnd, you know, they learned a lot during this period.\\xa0 They learned to do things differently than they have in the past, and, you know, they’ll do it hopefully until the virus has passed.\\xa0 And when the virus passes, I hope we’re going to be sitting next to each other in baseball games, football games, basketball games, ice hockey games.\\xa0 I hope we’re going to be sitting next to each other.\\xa0 I hope you have golf tourn- — the Masters is going to have 100,000 people, not 25 people watching at the course.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are worried about violence though?\\xa0 I mean, some of them (inaudible) threats at them.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I am not.\\xa0 No, I’m not.\\xa0 I think these people are — I’ve never seen so many American flags.\\xa0 I mean, I’m seeing the same thing that you’re seeing.\\xa0 I don’t see it any differently.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There are Nazi flags out there too.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They are who?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Nazis flags.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, that I totally would say, “No way.”\\xa0 But I’ve seen — I didn’t see that.\\xa0 I see all — of course, I’m sure the news plays that up.\\xa0 I’ve seen American flags all over the place.\\xa0 I have never seen so many American flags at a rally as I have at these rallies.\\xa0 These people love our country.\\xa0 They want to get back to work.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have you thought any more about pardoning Paul Manafort or Roger Stone so they’re not exposed to coronavirus in jail?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I’ll just tell you this: Roger Stone was treated very unfairly.\\xa0 Paul Manafort — the black book turned out to be a fraud.\\xa0 We learned that out during the various last number of weeks and months.\\xa0 They had a black book that came out of Ukraine.\\xa0 It turned out to be a fraud.\\xa0 It turned out to be a fraud.\\xa0 They convicted a man; it turned out to be a fraud.\\n\\nGeneral Flynn was a highly respected person, and it turned out to be a scam on him.\\xa0 The FBI said he didn’t lie.\\xa0 And Mueller’s people wanted him to go to jail.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So why not issue a pardon?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So what am I going to do?\\xa0 You’ll find out what I’m going do.\\xa0 I’m not going to say what I’m going to do.\\n\\nBut I will tell you, the whole thing turned out to be a scam, and it turned out to be a disgrace to our country, and it was a takedown of a duly elected president.\\n\\nAnd these people suffered greatly.\\xa0 General Flynn — I mean, what they did to him.\\xa0 And even the FBI said — and they had some — and nobody a bigger fan of the FBI than me, at the level of the people that really matter.\\xa0 But the top of the FBI was scum.\\n\\nAnd what they did to General Flynn — and you know it, and everybody knows it — was a disgrace.\\xa0 He was in the service for over 30 years.\\xa0 He ends up being a general and respected.\\xa0 Respected.\\xa0 And almost his first day in office, they come in with papers; they want to investigate him.\\xa0 It never happened before.\\xa0 And now the tables are turned.\\xa0 Investigate the investigators, I guess.\\n\\nThese were crooked people.\\xa0 These are bad people.\\xa0 These are very dangerous people. \\xa0You know what they are though?\\xa0 They’re scum.\\xa0 They’re human scum.\\n\\nAll right.\\xa0 Do you want to have one?\\xa0 In the back, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, please.\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 The CDC has finally admitted to profound failures with testing kits from the beginning of the outbreak.\\xa0 Is this a function of lax oversight from the Obama-Biden administration?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it’s not from me.\\xa0 I mean, they came in and they had some problems early on, but we’ve straightened it out.\\xa0 But yeah.\\xa0 I mean, look, I told you we inherited a lot of garbage.\\xa0 We took — they had tests that were no good.\\xa0 They had — all of this stuff was no good.\\xa0 It came from somewhere, so whoever — whoever came up with it.\\n\\nBut I’m proud to tell you that now we went from having a lot of bad things happening in CDC, to having great things happening where they’re doing a very good job now.\\n\\nBut, no, initially — look, our stockpiles were empty.\\xa0 We had horrible stockpiles.\\xa0 We had horrible ventilators.\\xa0 We had very few of them, too.\\xa0 And so did the states have very few of them.\\n\\nBut all of these things are — now we’re at a level that we’ve never been.\\xa0 The same with our military.\\xa0 Our military is the strongest it’s ever been.\\xa0 We spent one and a half trillion dollars on our military. \\xa0We’ve totally rebuilt our military.\\xa0 It’s never been in a position.\\xa0 We even have Space Force.\\xa0 Mike and I were talking about what an achievement that is.\\xa0 The first time in 72 years, we have a new force.\\n\\nSo, yeah, CDC had obsolete tests, old tests, broken tests, and a mess.\\xa0 But they’ve — they’ve done a very good job.\\xa0 And they’ve done it under pressure.\\xa0 The pressure is, you know, this — they had to do this under pressure.\\xa0 So we’re very proud of the job they’ve done.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you said “swabs are easy,” and this has been something that hospitals and the states have been saying there are shortages for more than a month now.\\xa0 Why wait to use the Defense Production Act until now?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we already have millions coming in.\\xa0 We have one company that we have to — we’re forced to use it with.\\xa0 And probably, by tomorrow, we won’t be.\\xa0 You know, it’s a tremendous hammer.\\xa0 Probably, by tomorrow, we won’t be.\\n\\nBut we have millions of them coming in.\\xa0 They’re very easy, by comparison.\\xa0 And in all fairness, governors could get them themselves — they really could — all of this.\\xa0 But we’re going to do it.\\xa0 We’re going to work with the governors, and if they can’t do it, we’re going to do it.\\xa0 If they do it, we can do it maybe cheaper, better.\\xa0 We’re going to get a very — we’re getting very high quality.\\xa0 With us, it’s all quality too.\\n\\nEven if it takes a little bit longer, we want the highest quality — and all of it, including the ventilators.\\n\\nSo, yeah, we’re going to — we have millions of them coming in very soon.\\xa0 And many of them already have been ordered, and the governors don’t know quite where they are, but they’ll be finding them fairly soon.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A question on that —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On President Xi —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On President Xi, you now talk about the missteps that China made early on in this crisis and how it put you — put the United States behind the curve.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, based on an investigation.\\xa0 We’re going to find out, yeah.\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So when you repeatedly praised Xi in January and February —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, this guy doesn’t stop.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — you said he will “solve the problem.”\\xa0 You said he was doing a “great job.”\\xa0 Were you duped by President Xi?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no, no, no.\\xa0 I made a deal that’s phenomenal for the United States.\\xa0 No, you know who was duped?\\xa0 You —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This is after the deal.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You and the Obama administration were duped for years because China was ripping off this country.\\xa0 Like in the history of any country, nobody has been ripped off like the United States by China — and many other countries.\\xa0 And we stop it.\\xa0 And we’ve done —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible) why you praised him at the time?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And we’ve done — we’ve done a deal where they’re paying us 250 — they are buying 250 — they didn’t do anything for us.\\xa0 You know, we didn’t even have a deal.\\xa0 It was so bad —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This is after the deal.\\xa0 These comments are after the deal.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no.\\xa0 No, no.\\xa0 It’s — it is about a deal, because the deal started a long time ago, before anybody heard about this.\\xa0 The deal was finished a number of months ago.\\xa0 Very happy — I was very happy.\\xa0 I hope they were happy.\\n\\nBillions of dollars came in, in tariffs.\\xa0 Billions of dollars.\\xa0 They’re going to be purchasing billions.\\xa0 And then, all of a sudden, long after that, I find out about this.\\n\\nAnd I told you —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 But why, on February 23rd —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I told you I’m not —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — did you say, “I think he’s doing a very good job —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Listen.\\xa0 Listen, CNN.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — it’s a big problem, but” —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Listen, CNN.\\xa0 I told you I’m not happy about it.\\xa0 And this was after the deal.\\xa0 So we have this wonderful deal.\\xa0 And I was very — nobody has been tougher before the deal ever, on China, than Trump.\\xa0 Then I made a deal.\\xa0 I was very happy with the deal.\\xa0 It’s a great deal.\\xa0 Great for our farmers.\\xa0 The farmers have been paid a fortune already.\\xa0 Then what happened —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Was it a mistake to take his word for it?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Then what happened — no mistake.\\xa0 We made a great deal.\\n\\nNow I find out after the deal — after the deal, not —\\xa0after the deal —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 I’m talking about February 23rd.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I find out that I’m not happy — you people are so pathetic at CNN.\\xa0 Let me just tell you —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I have the quote here from February 23rd.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 I was very happy with the deal, very happy with everything.\\xa0 Then we find out about the plague, right?\\xa0 The plague.\\xa0 And since we found out about that, I’m not happy.\\n\\nBut I closed it up long before Pelosi —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 This is after the —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Listen.\\xa0 Long before Pelosi.\\xa0 You know, she was having parties in San Francisco.\\xa0 “Let’s all go to Chinatown.”\\xa0 And that was a long time after the first —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This was after the travel restriction, sir.\\xa0 This was on February 23rd.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The first — the first of the month is next week —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s why your ratings are so bad, because you’re pathetic.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 Let’s go.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m reading you your quote, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Your ratings are terrible.\\xa0 You got to get back to real news.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The first of the month is next week, so for people that are worried about whether or not they’re going to see a stimulus check again next month, will there be another stimulus check going out?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re looking at it.\\xa0 We’re talking about it.\\xa0 It’s the — the delivery has been very good, as you know.\\xa0 People are getting them, and they’re happy.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How much money —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s saving lives.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How much money would this — would it be —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We will let you know when it’s appropriate.\\xa0 But we’re not going to let our people suffer.\\xa0 And you’ve seen that.\\xa0 By the way, you’ve seen that better than anyone.\\xa0 And you people have actually covered it, with — you know, within — eh, okay.\\n\\nBut you’ve seen what’s going on.\\xa0 And we got those checks out to people; it saved their lives.\\xa0 Nobody else could have done it.\\xa0 Nobody else could have done it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible) see another stimulus check?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And I’m very happy —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Should people plan ahead for another one?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 If we — if we get this new check out to the workers in these small — essentially, to the workers in these small businesses — the PPP — we are going to be — we’re going to be very happy.\\xa0 Because as we open, those businesses are going to open along with us.\\n\\nYeah, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, as you start reopening the country, do you plan to coordinate with Mexico and Canada to ensure that the U.S. manufacturers have —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 I could see that.\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 We’re coordinating right now with both.\\xa0 I spoke with the President of Mexico yesterday.\\xa0 I spoke with the Prime Minister of Canada a lot — Justin.\\xa0 And we’re in very good coordination right now.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just in terms of just the supply chain, as companies here are coming online —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, we’re — we’re doing the supply chain.\\xa0 It’s not going to affect trade.\\xa0 That’s part of trade, and it’s not going to affect trade.\\n\\nAnd if it does, I will tell you: If a supply chain based in Mexico or Canada interrupts with our making a big product and an important product, or even a military product, we’re not going to be happy, let me tell you that.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 One or two more.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, on state responsibility —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 In the back.\\xa0 You didn’t go.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ \\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, thank you very much.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Who are you with?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m with the Salt Lake Tribune.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Good.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 On Thursday, the White House announced a congressional task force for reopening America.\\xa0 It included every Republican senator but Mitt Romney.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Does that show that you’re still holding a grudge against Mitt Romney?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, it does.\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 No, I’m not a fan of Mitt Romney at all.\\xa0 No, I had 52 Republican senators.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 He was a governor.\\xa0 You don’t want his advice?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I just don’t think — you know, I’m not a fan of Mitt Romney.\\xa0 I don’t really want his advice.\\n\\nGo ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, why on that task force did you include Senator Kelly Loeffler?\\xa0 There’s some questions about whether she may have —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, because she’s the senator from a great state, a state that I love: Georgia.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But there’s some insider trading issues with her.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I — that, I don’t know.\\xa0 I really don’t know about that.\\xa0 But she’s a senator from Georgia, and she was included in the list, absolutely.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 A couple of more.\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, Mr. President, you spoke — you said you’d spoken to\\xa0Angela Merkel on the progress being made in Germany.\\xa0 And you spoke about —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Many of the leaders, yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, many of the countries that maybe have taken their eye off the ball and let coronavirus let rip in their countries.\\xa0 Which ones were you talking about?\\xa0 The UK?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You mean some of the ones that didn’t do well?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m not — I don’t say that.\\xa0 But you just have to look.\\xa0 And some of them just got hit hard.\\n\\nWhen I closed up our border, when I did the ban on China, they say a lot of the people that didn’t come in here went to Italy.\\xa0 You’ve heard that.\\xa0 That’s why Italy was hit so hard.\\n\\nI don’t think it was because of government.\\xa0 I will say, Italy is locked down probably more than any other country right now.\\xa0 It’s just absolutely locked solid down.\\xa0 But they got hit very hard because people that were coming to the United States couldn’t come because I closed the country in January.\\xa0 And they went to Italy, they say.\\xa0 It had to do with trade.\\xa0 It had to do with the purchase of certain materials.\\xa0 And Italy was another alternative.\\xa0 And so many, many people went to Italy, instead of coming here.\\xa0 And Italy has suffered greatly.\\n\\nNo, I spoke with the Prime Minister a lot.\\xa0 He’s a great friend of mine.\\xa0 And what’s happened to Italy is very, very tough.\\n\\nThank you all very much.\\xa0 We appreciate it.\\xa0 We’ll see you tomorrow.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nEND\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 7:57 P.M.

       "  'text': 'James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\\n\\n5:09 P.M. EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Good afternoon.\\xa0 We continue to see a number of positive signs that the virus has passed its peak.\\xa0 It’s been very devastating all over the world.\\xa0 A hundred and eighty-four countries.\\xa0 Probably more.\\xa0 That number was as of a week ago.\\n\\nDr. Birx will walk through some of these trends in a few moments, but they’re very positive trends for winning.\\xa0 Going to win.\\xa0 We’re going to close it out.\\n\\nWhile we mourn the tragic loss of life — and you can’t mourn it any stronger than we’re mourning it — the United States has produced dramatically better health outcomes than any other country, with the possible exception of Germany.\\xa0 And I think we’re as good or better.\\n\\nOn a per capita basis — remember that: On a per capita basis, our mortality rate is far lower than other nations of Western Europe, with the lone exception of possibly Germany.\\xa0 This includes the UK, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, France.\\xa0 Spain, for example, has a mortality rate that is nearly four times that of the United States, but you don’t hear that.\\xa0 You hear we have more death.\\xa0 But we’re much bigger countries than any of those countries by far.\\n\\nSo when the fake news gets out there and they start talking about the United States is number one — but we’re not number one; China is number one, just so you understand.\\xa0 China is number one by a lot.\\xa0 It’s not even close.\\xa0 They’re way ahead of us in terms of death.\\xa0 It’s not even close.\\xa0 You know it.\\xa0 I know it.\\xa0 And they know it.\\xa0 But you don’t want to report it.\\xa0 Why?\\xa0 You’ll have to explain that. \\xa0Someday I’ll explain it.\\n\\nSince we released the guidelines to open up America again — and this was two days ago — a number of states, led by both Democrat and Republican governors, have announced concrete steps to begin a safe, gradual, and phased opening.\\n\\nTexas and Vermont will allow certain businesses to open on Monday while still requiring appropriate social distancing precautions.\\xa0 And I can tell you the Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, he knows what he’s doing.\\xa0 He’s a great governor.\\xa0 He knows exactly what he’s doing.\\n\\nMontana will begin lifting restrictions on Friday.\\xa0 Ohio, North Dakota, and Idaho have advised non-essential businesses to prepare for a phased opening starting May 1st.\\n\\nThroughout this crisis, my administration has taken unprecedented actions to rush economic relief to our citizens.\\xa0 As an example, you don’t hear anymore about ventilators.\\xa0 What happened to the ventilators?\\xa0 And now they’re giving you the other; it’s called “testing.”\\xa0 Testing.\\xa0 But they don’t want to use all of the capacity that we’ve created.\\xa0 We have tremendous capacity.\\xa0 Dr. Birx will be explaining that.\\xa0 They know that.\\xa0 The governors know that.\\xa0 The Democrat governors know that; they’re the ones that are complaining.\\n\\nThrough the Paycheck Protection Program, we’ve already processed nearly $350 billion to 1.6 million small businesses across the nation to keep American workers on the payroll.\\xa0 So we’re asking the Democrats to get it done.\\xa0 This should be bipartisan.\\xa0 This should be 100 percent vote.\\xa0 And it’s really been incredible.\\xa0 The $350 billion that’s been approved is so popular, and it’s keeping businesses open.\\xa0 It’ll be open hopefully forever.\\n\\nOur swift action is directly supporting 30 million American jobs.\\xa0 Amy Wright, from North Carolina, as an example, said the program is a “game changer” for her and her family.\\xa0 It’s coffee shops.\\xa0 And she has 120 employees, many of whom have developmental and intellectual disabilities.\\xa0 And now they’re all staying, and they’re getting paid.\\xa0 And she’s got a dream, and it’s going to take place very quickly when she opens again.\\xa0 So, Amy, good luck.\\xa0 North Carolina — great place.\\n\\nScott and Julie Alderink helped lead a church and own a restaurant in South Dakota, with about 15 employees.\\xa0 They were already starting layoffs.\\xa0 Layoffs were moving along rapidly.\\xa0 But now they’ve hired their employees back, and they can keep the restaurant open.\\xa0 And it’ll be moving quickly — very quickly — as opposed to not having anybody and probably not having a place to have all of these people employed.\\xa0 She would have been out of business.\\xa0 She would have been done.\\n\\nThe Paycheck Protection Program funding is now fully drained.\\xa0 It’s out.\\xa0 It’s gone.\\xa0 Three hundred and fifty billion dollars to small businesses.\\xa0 And, in turn, it goes to the employees of those small businesses.\\n\\nLawmakers must stop blocking these funds and replenish the program without delay.\\xa0 The Democrats have to come onboard.\\xa0 I used to read that these were Democrat programs, not Republican.\\xa0 It seems to have switched around a lot, hasn’t it?\\xa0 Huh?\\xa0 Switched around a lot.\\xa0 The republicans want it.\\xa0 I think the Democrats probably do too.\\n\\nBut they also want other things that are unacceptable.\\xa0 This is about COVID.\\xa0 This is about the plague and what it’s done to us.\\xa0 This isn’t about extraneous things that they’ve been trying to get for years and that our country doesn’t want them to have.\\n\\nAs we enter the next stage of our battle, we are continuing our relentless effort to destroy the virus.\\xa0 My administration is taking steps to protect high-risk communities by providing funding for 13,000 community health center sites and mobile medical stations.\\n\\nIn order to equip them with the most advanced and robust testing capabilities, these sites are incredible.\\xa0 What they can do is incredible.\\xa0 The job they do is incredible.\\xa0 These centers provide care to 28 million people living in medically underserved urban and rural regions, including many African American and Hispanic communities.\\xa0 We’re taking care of them.\\xa0 And it’s so important, because you’ve all been reading about the disproportionate numbers on African American, and you’re reading a little bit less about Hispanic, but likewise Hispanic communities.\\xa0 The numbers are disproportionate.\\xa0 In fact, we’re doing big studies on it right now.\\xa0 We don’t like it.\\xa0 Not right.\\n\\nNationwide, we’ve now conducted over 4 million tests, and Deborah will be talking about that.\\xa0 It’s double the number conducted by any other country on Earth.\\xa0 So that’s more than two times, actually, the number conducted by any other country on Earth.\\xa0 You hear so much about testing.\\xa0 What we’ve done is incredible on testing.\\xa0 And I started with an obsolete, broken system from a previous administration — or administrations.\\xa0 But I would really say “administration” for a different reason because testing has become so advanced over the last number of years, and we have the most advanced of all.\\n\\nI spoke with other nations this morning — the leaders — and they all are talking about our great testing capability, and some of them want to know what to do; what — how can they get involved, because they need it for their own countries.\\n\\nIn Louisiana, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, and other hotspots, we have also tested more people per capita, by far, than Italy, Spain, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, and all other major countries.\\xa0 So think of that.\\xa0 In New York, for instance, per capita testing is 6 percent higher than in Singapore.\\xa0 In fact, there’s a typo.\\xa0 It’s 67 percent higher.\\xa0 That’s a big difference.\\n\\nI’d say there’s a big difference between six percent and sixty- — I was looking; I said, 6 percent doesn’t look too good.\\xa0 It’s 67 percent — good job out there — higher than Singapore; 64 higher than South Korea; and 47 percent higher than Australia.\\xa0 So it’s 67 percent higher than Singapore, which is a very advanced place in terms of what they’re doing.\\n\\nMy administration has also been speaking frequently with many of the governors to help them find and unlock the vast unused testing capacity that exists in their states.\\xa0 Dr. Birx discussed yesterday the commercial and academic laboratories, and the states have tremendous unused capability, which they can use.\\xa0 The governors should use it.\\xa0 Tremendous unused capability, and they’re waiting for business from these governors that — some of them complain.\\xa0 I must tell you, for the most part, we’re getting along great with them, but some of them like to complain.\\n\\nBut I still go back because the hardest thing of all, by far, by a factor of 20, is the ventilators.\\xa0 And now we’re the king of ventilators.\\xa0 We have ventilators.\\n\\nWe’re going to be helping other countries very soon.\\xa0 We’re going to be helping Mexico.\\xa0 I spoke with the President of Mexico.\\xa0 He’s great.\\xa0 A great guy.\\xa0 And I told him we’re going to be helping him.\\xa0 They desperately, in Mexico, need ventilators, and I told him we’re going to be helping him very substantially.\\xa0 We’re in a position to do that.\\xa0 We’re building, now, thousands a week.\\xa0 And they’re coming in rapidly, and they’re very, very high quality.\\n\\nBut we’re also helping governors to develop strategies to smartly deploy their testing capacity to protect vulnerable and underserved populations, while getting Americans at lower risk safely back to work.\\n\\nSo, again, we have tremendous testing capacity.\\xa0 Now, a lot of people like the Abbott test that we came up with.\\xa0 Abbott is a brand-new technology, brand-new test.\\xa0 It’s great.\\xa0 It’s five minutes, boom, you put it in.\\xa0 And we’re making thousands of machines.\\xa0 Abbott is making thousands and thousands of machines.\\xa0 But not everybody is going to get that one, but they’re going to get others.\\xa0 We have numerous platforms which we’ll talk about in a minute.\\n\\nUnfortunately, some partisan voices are attempting to politicize the issue of testing, which they shouldn’t be doing, because I inherited broken junk.\\xa0 Just as they did with ventilators where we had virtually none, and the hospitals were empty.\\xa0 For the most part, the hospitals didn’t have ventilators.\\xa0 We had to take care of the whole country, and we did a job, the likes of which nobody — we assembled an army of young, brilliant people.\\xa0 For the most part, young; a couple of older ones.\\xa0 But for the most part, they were young, brilliant geniuses that did a job like nobody would believe.\\xa0 I wish you could have seen it.\\xa0 Around the clock.\\n\\nAnd now the rest of the world is coming to us, asking if we could help them with ventilators because they’re very complicated, very expensive.\\xa0 They’re very hard to build.\\xa0 And we have them coming in by the thousands.\\xa0 But you don’t hear that from even the governors.\\xa0 Nobody is complaining about ventilators.\\xa0 And if there was a surge, we could have ventilators to them within hours, because we have in stockpile almost 10,000 ventilators.\\n\\nYou don’t hear about hospital beds.\\xa0 When I first started, everyone was talking, “Oh, hospitals beds.\\xa0 Hospitals beds.”\\xa0\\xa0 The governor of New York correctly asked me for hospital beds, and we got the Army Corps of Engineers out, and they built them.\\xa0 He needed them.\\xa0 I mean, he — we went — I know he said that we were projecting.\\xa0 We’re not projecting New York.\\xa0 We’re listening to the governors.\\xa0 He wanted them.\\xa0 He needed them.\\xa0 And we gave him thousands of beds in Javits Center.\\xa0 We brought the ship.\\xa0 And then the ship, we had it converted to COVID-19.\\xa0 And that was a big deal, by the way, because of ventilation and all the things we had to do.\\xa0 But we did.\\n\\nAnd fortunately for him — and for us, all of us — they haven’t used either one very much because the numbers have gone down significantly.\\xa0 But it was there, and it was built, and it was beautiful.\\xa0 Two thousand nine hundred beds.\\xa0 It was incredible what they did.\\xa0 They did it in a matter of a few days.\\n\\nBut, unfortunately — and it was very good; the relationship was very good.\\xa0 And I’m, frankly, glad they don’t need them, but they were there.\\xa0 Louisiana, the same thing.\\xa0 I think the governor — a Democrat, good guy — and he will, I think, tell you a story that we had more than enough, and I said, “Well, we’re supposed to build one more.”\\xa0 I called him and I said, “You know, if we don’t have to build this hospital” — it was an additional anywhere from 500 to 1,000 beds.\\xa0 “If you don’t need it, would it be possible that we don’t build it?\\xa0 We’d like to build it someplace else, or not build it at all and save money,” which is okay for government to use it someplace else.\\xa0 And he called call me back the next day and he said, “Sir, we don’t need it.”\\xa0 I said, “That’s great that you say that.\\xa0 I appreciate it.”\\xa0 And he didn’t need it.\\n\\nBut we were ready to go, and we took good care of Louisiana.\\xa0 We took good care of Michigan.\\xa0 We took good care of every place.\\xa0 We didn’t — we didn’t miss a trick.\\n\\nAnd we’re in great shape on testing.\\xa0 We have different platforms.\\xa0 We actually have nine different platforms.\\xa0 And on Monday, we’re going to be adding one; that’ll be 9 to 10.\\xa0 I don’t like to count on them before they’re up, but we’ll have anywhere from 9 to 10 platforms with a tremendous testing capability.\\xa0 And people can go, and especially with phase one.\\n\\nNow, at the same time — just like with ventilators — we’re building now the best ventilators.\\xa0 Just like with ventilators, our testing is getting better and better.\\xa0 I took the first test.\\xa0 The first test was not pleasant.\\xa0 This was not a pleasant thing.\\xa0 I said, “You got to be kidding” to the doctor.\\xa0 “You got to be kidding.”\\xa0 Up your nose and then we hang a right, and it goes down here.\\xa0 And then we’ll wiggle it around here, under your eye.\\xa0 And then we’ll pull it out and we’ll say — I said, “No, that’s — there’s no way that can happen.\\xa0 Is that the way it goes?\\xa0 You sure?”\\xa0 This was a very unpleasant test.\\n\\nAnd then I was tested a few weeks later with the new test that just came out, the Abbott, where they just touch your nose, basically.\\xa0 And they put it in a machine, and literally, a few minutes later, they tell you if you’re fine. \\xa0And I was lucky in both cases, because I’ve seen the damage that this does to people.\\n\\nBut we have great tests.\\xa0 They’ve really gotten better and better and better as we go along.\\xa0 But we have a tremendous lab capability — laboratory capability all over the country.\\xa0 And for some reason, the governors, they’re not — a lot of them are, but some of the governors like to complain, and they’re not using it.\\xa0 We have tremendous capability.\\xa0 We’re ready for them.\\n\\nAnd, as we go along, just like with ventilators, we’ll get better, more advanced, and, you know, it’ll be — we’ll be able to do things that nobody would have even believed possible.\\xa0 But we started off with a broken system.\\xa0 We inherited a broken, terrible system.\\n\\nAnd I always say it: Our cupboards were bare.\\xa0 We had very little in our stockpile.\\xa0 Now we’re loaded up.\\xa0 And we also loaded up these hospitals.\\xa0 And, you know, we’re talking about payment.\\xa0 We gave billions of dollars’ worth of things to hospitals, and we’ll have to work that out at some point.\\xa0 In fact, I guess they’re going to be working that out with Congress.\\n\\nBut we loaded up hospitals.\\xa0 The federal government loaded up hospitals with things to take care of people that are very desperately — we’re not — we weren’t worried about payment at that time.\\xa0 We said, “You’ll take care of it at the right time.”\\n\\nBut we gave billions and billions and billions of dollars’ worth of medical goods and medicines and equipment to hospitals.\\xa0 And we’ll — we’ll work it out with them.\\xa0 But people don’t like to talk about that.\\n\\nSo we have done a job that nobody believed — this was a military and private enterprises march.\\xa0 We marched — and, unfortunately, with the other side, because they’re viewing it as an election.\\xa0 “How did President Trump do?”\\xa0 “Oh, he did, uh, terribly.\\xa0 Let’s see.\\xa0 He did — uh, yeah, he did terribly.”\\xa0 “Oh.”\\xa0 But we just got them the ventilators that they didn’t have, that they should have had.\\xa0 We just got them hospital beds by the thousands.\\xa0 We just got them testing that they don’t even know how to use.\\xa0 In some cases, they have machines that they’re only using 5 percent and 10 percent of the machine, because they have an advanced machine and they don’t know how to use it.\\xa0 It can use — it can do much more.\\xa0 So we’ve had people explain how to use it.\\n\\nSo, I don’t know, I don’t think I do that on the other side.\\xa0 I don’t — I really don’t.\\xa0 I think that here we have a crisis that we have to work together, and I hope we’re going to work together. \\xa0But we’re moving along, and we’re moving along well.\\xa0 We’re moving along well.\\n\\nThis should not be a partisan witch hunt — you know? — like the Russia hunt that turned out to be a total phony deal.\\xa0 Unfortunately, some of these voices, though, are attempting to — to bring this into politics.\\xa0 And whether it’s testing or ventilators or hospital beds, or other dimensions of our sweeping public health response — we have had a sweeping response.\\n\\nIn speaking to the leaders of other countries this morning, they said, “This is incredible the way you’ve done this so quickly.”\\xa0 You know, we’re only talking about a few weeks since everybody knew this was such a big problem.\\xa0 And the rest of the world is watching, and they respect what we’ve done because I don’t think anybody else — I know nobody else could have done what we’ve done.\\xa0 And we started with garbage.\\n\\nAs our experts said yesterday, America’s testing capability and capacity is fully sufficient to begin opening up the country, totally.\\xa0 Indeed, our system is by far the most robust and advanced anywhere in the world, by far.\\xa0 The rest of the world will tell you that.\\n\\nI spoke this morning to a friend of mine, President Moon of South Korea.\\xa0 He just won the election.\\xa0 He won it by a lot.\\xa0 He had a big victory, which I was happy about.\\xa0 And he was saying what a great job we’ve done in this country.\\xa0 I told him the same thing.\\xa0 He said what a great job we’ve done here in this country.\\xa0 So I appreciated that.\\xa0 He had a great — by the way, he had a great victory and we’re very happy about that, from the standpoint of our country.\\xa0 We’re working very well with them — South Korea.\\n\\nAs we approach — and the approach that we use — but as we approach, hopefully, the downward side of what’s going on, I think you’re going to see some incredible hard facts and evidence that what we did was right.\\xa0 There’s a lot of talk about herd — the word “herd.”\\xa0 I don’t want to show you charts of people that went a different way, but it’s scary.\\xa0 It’s scary.\\n\\nWe would have had, I think, millions of people die had we done a different way.\\xa0 And I think numbers are just coming out where they’re estimating 60,000 people will die.\\xa0 That’s horrible.\\xa0 I always say one person is too much, especially in this case, when it could have been stopped in China.\\xa0 It could have been stopped in China, before it started, and it wasn’t.\\xa0 And the whole world is suffering because of it.\\n\\nBut this herd concept — and everybody had to think of it at the beginning, because, look — look at us: We had the greatest economy in the history of the world.\\xa0 Better than China; better than any country in the world; better than any country has ever had.\\xa0 We had the highest stock market in history, by far.\\xa0 And I’m honored by the fact that it has started to go up very substantially.\\xa0 That’s because the market is smart.\\xa0 The market is actually brilliant.\\xa0 I’ve seen it.\\xa0 And they’re viewing it like we’ve done a good job.\\xa0 They view it that way.\\n\\nBecause if you would have told me that we’re at 24,000 or beyond, and the highest we were ever was — we never hit 30.\\xa0 We were getting close to 30, so let’s say around 29,000.\\xa0 We’re at 24.\\xa0 If we were heading down, I would start to say, “Oh, wow, we may be heading into territory where I started.”\\xa0 I didn’t like that.\\xa0 Now we’re way up.\\xa0 But if you would have said to me with what we’ve gone through — not caused by our country or our people or any — I mean, not caused by certainly anybody within our country.\\xa0 But if you would have said that, after going through this horrible plague, that we’d have a stock market that’s much, much higher than when I started, much higher than where I started — and I think it’s — you know, I think we have tremendous momentum.\\xa0 We have a big election coming up, but I think we have tremendous momentum.\\n\\nFirst, we get rid of the plague.\\xa0 And because of what we’re doing with the PPP, what we’re doing with the Paycheck, as we call it, I think we have a chance to have these companies get back to action quickly.\\n\\nBut our approach to testing is based on facts, data, and very hard evidence, not partisan agendas or coordinated political talking points.\\n\\nMike Pence, who’s a phenomenal guy, he’s making the commencement address right now at the Air Force Academy, where they’re being very politically correct.\\xa0 Everyone is standing not 6 feet but 10 feet apart.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 And it’s very different.\\xa0 I made that speech last year.\\xa0 I’m going to West Point.\\xa0 I think they’re changing the date to June 13th because of what’s going on in New York.\\xa0 They’re moving into June 13th.\\xa0 West Point.\\n\\nSo I’m doing their commencement speech, and they’re going to have — it’s sad because — but it’s a big start — they’re going to have the cadets.\\xa0 They may not have the parents, but they’re going to have the cadets.\\xa0 The parents are so proud of them.\\xa0 I know at the Air Force Academy, where Mike is speaking right now, they don’t have the parents; they have the cadets.\\xa0 They’re very, very widespread.\\n\\nAnd you talk about social distancing — I mean, they are really spread.\\xa0 I looked at it.\\xa0 They using 10 feet.\\xa0 So he’s — he’s doing that.\\xa0 But they’re having it.\\xa0 It’s very important to have it.\\xa0 And that’s a great thing.\\xa0 That’s a great thing.\\xa0 That’s a big start.\\n\\nSo he’s there right now.\\xa0 And I will tell you, they — he’s a gentleman, Mike Pence.\\xa0 A real gentleman.\\xa0 And they requested — the Democrat senators requested a phone call with him yesterday.\\xa0 And I think they had, for the most part, all of them on — like, approximately 47.\\xa0 I heard it was just about all of them, whatever it might be.\\xa0 I don’t want to be wrong by 1 or 2 or 10 and have the press say, “He lied.\\xa0 He told a lie.\\xa0 Terrible, terrible.”\\xa0 Whatever it was.\\xa0 But they have 47, and I guess most of them were on.\\n\\nI heard they were so rude.\\xa0 I used a term today — I said, rude and nasty.\\xa0 But I heard they were so rude.\\xa0 No matter what he said, which was all very positive in terms of winning this battle against the invisible enemy — no matter what he said, they were fresh.\\xa0 They were nasty.\\n\\nAnd it was, I heard, just a terrible thing.\\xa0 And I said, “Mike, that’s politics.\\xa0 That’s what it is.”\\xa0 If we came into this room today and said, “The battle is over.\\xa0 We have won.\\xa0 It’s 100 percent gone.”\\xa0 The Democrats would say, “The President has done a horrible job.\\xa0 He has done a disgraceful job.\\xa0 It is a shame how bad he is.”\\n\\nYou know, it’s — it’s — this is the talking points; this is political.\\xa0 And it would be nice not to have that, especially when we’ve done the job we’ve done.\\xa0 I mean, all you have to do is look at the big — the big “V” for victory or “V” for ventilator.\\xa0 Take a look at it.\\xa0 Everybody said they had us on that; they had us.\\xa0 They thought they had us, but we got them done at numbers that nobody would have believed.\\n\\nAnd we did use our Act, our Production Act, and we used it.\\xa0 But didn’t use it — we didn’t need it like a hammer.\\xa0 All we had to do — for the most part — we used it, actually, in a number of cases.\\xa0 But for the most part, all we had to do is talk about it. \\xa0All we had to do is say, “We’re going to use it if you don’t do this.”\\xa0 And everybody was, you know, for the most part, good.\\xa0 We used it a couple of times because it didn’t work out the easy way, but it worked out the hard way.\\n\\nBut whether it was masks or ventilator, it was incredible what we’ve been able to do.\\xa0 So this is a very critical time for the American people, and the American people deserve real information, and responsible and thoughtful dialogue from their elected leaders and from the media.\\n\\nThe media has been — some very honest, but some very dishonest.\\xa0 You know that.\\xa0 You know that.\\xa0 I mean, I even read a story where Mark Meadows — a tough guy — he was crying; he was crying.\\xa0 This was a Maggie Haberman.\\xa0 You know, she won a Pulitzer Prize for her coverage of Russia, but she was wrong on Russia.\\xa0 So was everyone else.\\xa0 They should all give back their Pulitzer Prizes.\\n\\nIn fact, it turned out that the crime was committed by the other side.\\xa0 The crime was not committed by this side; it was committed by the other side — a bunch of bad people.\\xa0 You saw the reports coming out over the last two weeks.\\xa0 They got caught.\\xa0 So Maggie Haberman gets a Pulitzer Prize?\\xa0 She’s a third-rate reporter.\\xa0 New York Times.\\n\\nAnd we put her name up here last week.\\xa0 You saw that.\\xa0 People thought it was a commercial.\\xa0 It wasn’t a commercial.\\xa0 It was like a commercial, but it wasn’t a commercial.\\xa0 It was just clips.\\xa0 And because we exposed her as being a bad reporter, what happened is she came out and said Mark Meadows was crying.\\xa0 And they made it sound — I said, “Mark” — and it’s okay if he did.\\xa0 I wouldn’t — you know, look.\\xa0 But I think he was crying probably — really, for the wrong reason they had it down.\\xa0 But he’s not a crier.\\xa0 And if he was — I know criers.\\xa0 I could tell you people that you know that are very famous.\\xa0 They cry, and that’s okay too.\\n\\nBut it was a nasty story in so many ways.\\xa0 It was fake news.\\xa0 And she only did it because we exposed her for being a terrible, dishonest reporter.\\xa0 She is. \\xa0I’ve known her for a long while.\\xa0 I haven’t spoken to her in a long time.\\xa0 I made the mistake: I take a picture with her at the desk, a long time ago.\\xa0 Every time she does a story, if I say — I haven’t spoken to her in long — many, many, many months, maybe years.\\xa0 I don’t speak to her.\\xa0 She’s fake.\\xa0 A lot of people are fake.\\xa0 A lot of people\\xa0 We got a lot of fake people.\\n\\nBut what happens is she writes this story as retribution.\\xa0 Puts it in the New York Times.\\xa0 And the New York Times is a very dishonest newspaper.\\xa0 It’s my opinion.\\xa0 It’s not an opinion.\\xa0 It’s actually, from my standpoint — you know, the very hard thing to figure, though: Most people wouldn’t know that, but I know it because I know the facts.\\n\\nAnd they make up — I said it today; they make up words.\\xa0 “Sources say…” Most often used: “Sources say…”\\xa0 You know what “sources say” means?\\xa0 “Sources say” means they have nobody.\\xa0 And they make it up.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nAnd they have a few other type statements that mean the same thing.\\xa0 But “sources say” is the most often-used express- — in the Washington Post; New York Times, especially; CNN — fake news.\\xa0 CNN.\\n\\nThey should really be mandated, and I mean mandated to use a name.\\xa0 If there’s a source, use a name.\\xa0 Say that Kayleigh — “Kayleigh McEnany said…” or somebody.\\xa0 And you’d find out that the — number one, the source wouldn’t say it.\\xa0 The sources don’t exist.\\xa0 I don’t believe the sources exist.\\n\\nAnd I try and tell this — you know, the beautiful thing about doing these conferences is that we have tremendous numbers of viewers, and I’m able to reach the viewers without having to go through fake news, where they make a good story into a bad story.\\n\\nSo, with all of that, it’s been an incredible period of time.\\xa0 We’ve done a fantastic job.\\xa0 We’re the talk of other nations.\\xa0 The leaders of other nations are calling us for help.\\xa0 They’re calling us for equipment.\\xa0 They’re calling us for testing capacities.\\n\\nNow, with the testing, we are going further.\\xa0 Deborah is going to talk about that now.\\xa0 With the testing, we have some other tests coming up that are going to be, I think, phenomenal.\\xa0 I think they’re going to blow away everything as soon as they come out, and we’re going to get them out as soon as possible.\\n\\nBut I’d like to ask Dr. Birx to come up and say a few words about where we’ve come, how far we’ve come, and more importantly, where we’re going from this point.\\xa0 Because honestly, it’s — it’s quite amazing.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 If we could have the first slide.\\n\\nI wanted to give you an update on where we are as states and as counties and as cities.\\xa0 I know you all are watching carefully.\\xa0 The numbers have shifted over the last few days.\\xa0 What happens when nations — when states change the reporting from “confirmed” to “probable”?\\xa0 So now all probable cases are included.\\xa0 They had to add them back in.\\xa0 Even though the cases may have been from March, they were added over 14, 15, and 16th of April, and states may continue to be adding them.\\xa0 Eventually, we’re hoping that those get accounted for on the day when the presumptive cases or the probable cases were counted.\\xa0 But right now, they’re added in, in one fell swoop.\\n\\nSo this is New York and New Jersey, and I think we all know how difficult and what a difficult time both New York and New Jersey have had.\\xa0 I call your attention to the axis; it goes up to 250,000 cases.\\xa0 So you can get a frame of how we’re talking about some of the other metro areas.\\n\\nNext slide.\\n\\nThis is the 25 metro areas — the top 25 metro areas.\\xa0 And you can only see the New York metro area in this slide.\\xa0 Again, the axis goes up to about 300,000.\\xa0 It includes the New Jersey part of the metro area, as well as part of southern Connecticut.\\n\\nNext slide.\\n\\nBut if I take New York out — and the reason I wanted to do that — now the axis is one-tenth of the previous axis.\\xa0 So that previous ax- — the previous slide, 300,000.\\xa0 This slide, 30,000.\\xa0 So that will give you a frame of reference for some of these other metros.\\n\\nThe reason I wanted to show you this is this is cumulative cases.\\xa0 And we are still tracking, very closely, the issues in Chicago and Boston.\\xa0 But on this slide, I hope you can see the yellow line; that is Detroit.\\xa0 And Detroit and this mayor of Detroit has really done an extraordinary job, and the people of Detroit have done an extraordinary job with their social distancing.\\n\\nThe other line I want to call your attention to is the line here.\\xa0 This is New Orleans.\\xa0 And I think — frankly, I was concerned about New Orleans because they had a lot of preexisting comorbidities.\\xa0 They only — they have two or three major hospitals, but a large cover, a very large area of geographic area.\\n\\nAnd that other blue line that you can see — it’s down right here — that’s the Seattle line.\\xa0 And you can see that their response, because of the nursing home alert, they were one of the first states and the first metro areas to really move to social distancing.\\xa0 And so they’ve really never had a peak, like many of the other metros.\\n\\nNext slide.\\n\\nThen I just want to take you through some of these new case graphics.\\xa0 That was cumulative cases.\\xa0 This is daily cases.\\xa0 And obviously, there’s a lot of variability, and variability in reporting, but you get a sense over time, when you look at daily cases.\\n\\nSo New Orleans is on the — on panel on your left, and Baton Rouge on your right.\\xa0 But you can see clearly, New Orleans, about a month ago, very low levels, probably less than 50 cases.\\xa0 Large peak and spike around the beginning of April.\\xa0 And they have come down, and they have it down to very few cases.\\xa0 Again, I showed you before how both their syndromic cases have come down, as well as their actual case — number of cases.\\n\\nNext slide.\\n\\nThis is Seattle.\\xa0 So you can see they had a much lower peak.\\xa0 And this is — when we talked about flattening the curve, this is what flattening the curve looks like.\\xa0 It becomes a longer, slower decline, but it ever gets very high, and then goes back down.\\n\\nNext slide.\\n\\nAnd then this is Detroit.\\xa0 And we always look at the metros as a consolidated.\\xa0 So this is both Wayne and Oakland in Michigan.\\xa0 And we really want to thank the mayor for the incredible job that they have done to really ensure that everyone is receiving the adequate healthcare and testing, and they’ve done quite a good job with testing in Michigan.\\n\\nBut all of these states — Louisiana and New York have tested 30,000 per million inhabitants.\\xa0 Those are some of our highest numbers across the board.\\n\\nAnd next slide.\\n\\nAnd so the President talked about the case fatality rates, and we really — we’ve lost a lot of Americans to this disease, and we pray and hope for each one of them that are in the hospitals and the excellent care.\\n\\nWhat this graph illustrates is the amazing work of the American people to really adhere to social distancing.\\xa0 This was some — this was nothing we had ever attempted to do as a nation, and the world hadn’t attempted to do.\\xa0 But they were able to decrease the number of cases so that, in general, most of the metro areas never had an issue of complete crisis care of all of their hospitals in the region.\\n\\nAnd so you can see our case fatality rate is about half to a third of many of the other countries.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And, excuse me, does anybody really believe this number?\\xa0 Does anybody really believe this number?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 I put China on there so you could see how basically unrealistic this could be.\\xa0 When highly developed healthcare delivery systems — the United Kingdom and France and Belgium and Italy and Spain — with extraordinary doctors and nurses and equipment have case fatality rates in the 20s, up to 45, and Belgium’s extraordinarily competent healthcare delivery system, and then China at .33, you realize that these numbers, even — and this includes the doubled number out of Wuhan.\\n\\nAnd so I wanted, really, to put it in perspective, but I wanted you also to see how great the care has been for every American that has been hospitalized and how extraordinary work of our doctors and nurses in our laboratorians on the front line who have been doing an excellent job.\\n\\nNext slide.\\n\\nAnd then we also wanted to show —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 If I might add, though, also —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — the number for Iran.\\xa0 Does anybody really believe that number?\\xa0 You see what’s going on over there.\\xa0 Does anybody — put that slide back, if you would.\\xa0 Does anybody believe this number?\\xa0 Does anybody believe this number?\\xa0 You saw more bags —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 And this is why —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — on television than that.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 This is why the reporting is so important.\\xa0 And I think you remember, almost six weeks ago, maybe a month ago, I was telling you what Italy was showing to us and what France was telling to us, and the warnings that they gave to us and said, “Be very careful.\\xa0 There’s an extraordinary high mortality among people with preexisting conditions.”\\xa0 And we used their information to bring that to the American people.\\n\\nThat came — that alert — that alert, before we even had significant cases, came from our European colleagues on the front line.\\xa0 And that’s why we keep coming back to how important, in a pandemic and a new disease, it’s really critical to have that level of transparency because it changes how we work as a nation.\\xa0 It allowed us on — over March 15 to make an alert out there about vulnerable individuals and the — really, they need to protect them, and my call-out to millennials to really protect their parents, protect their grandparents, and get that information out to everyone that there were preexisting conditions that put people at greater risk.\\xa0 That information came from our European colleagues who were in the midst of their battle themselves.\\n\\nAnd so there is never an excuse to not share information.\\xa0 When you are the first country to have an outbreak, you really have a moral obligation to the world to not only talk about it, but provide that information that’s critical to the rest of the world to really respond to this credibly.\\n\\nAnd I really want to thank our European colleagues who have worked so hard to get us that information, even in the midst of their own tragedies.\\xa0 And I think that really shows how important transparency is.\\n\\nAnd we go to the next slide.\\n\\nWe can show you this really encouraging and great news: So we know that fatalities will continue to lag because people are in hospitals still, and some are still sit in intensive care units.\\n\\nBut these COVID-like illnesses — this is our hospitalizations that are related to flu per 100,000 Americans.\\xa0 This is this year’s flu season.\\xa0 And you can see our COVID-like illnesses.\\xa0 And this is all of them, probable and confirmed cases.\\xa0 Our hospitalizations are declining.\\n\\nNow, I showed you metros that have made tremendous progress, and we’ve been up here many times talking about it being 6, 10, 15 additional cities.\\xa0 And now we’re really just focused on Chicago and Boston and Massachusetts, and really some issues that Providence is starting to improve now.\\xa0 So their relationship to the two large outbreak cities.\\xa0 But this is really reassuring to us, the progress we’re making across the country against this disease.\\n\\nAnd I’m — just really want to conclude by thanking again the American people for making these type of graphics possible; thank the data team who puts these together for me.\\xa0 So they are working until about 3:30 every morning to make sure that we have the most up-to-date information.\\xa0 That’s the data that goes to our supply-chain individuals to ensure that every hospital in every state and every community has what they need based on data, and to make sure that we’re serving the needs of the American people as effectively as possible.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much, Deborah.\\xa0 Fantastic job.\\xa0 Is this yours?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\n\\nThe fact is that we’ve been learning a lot from Deborah and Tony and so many of the professionals, the director.\\n\\nPEPFAR: We’re spending — the United States, without help, to the best of my knowledge — mostly in Africa, $6 billion a year.\\xa0 And that’s on AIDS.\\xa0 What we’ve done for AIDS in Africa is unbelievable.\\xa0 We spend $6 billion a year.\\xa0 That’s been going on for a long time.\\xa0 Nobody knows that; you’ve never heard that.\\xa0 I’ve never heard that.\\xa0 Six billion dollars a year.\\n\\nMillions of people are living right now, and living very comfortably, because of the fact that we have found the answer to that horrible, horrible plague.\\xa0 That was a plague.\\n\\nBut we spent $6 billion a year.\\xa0 And from what I hear, it’s very well spent, done by professionals, including this great professional right here.\\xa0 That was the thing that you worked hardest on and something that was very close to her heart.\\xa0 So it’s — you know, it’s something that I think people should start hearing.\\n\\nThe World Health Organization: We’re just finding more and more problems.\\xa0 And we spend this money really well.\\xa0 There are other ways we can spend the $500 million.\\xa0 That’s $500 million; this is $6 billion.\\xa0 But we can find other ways to spend it where people are going to be helped, we think, in a much greater — in a much greater way.\\n\\nWe’re doing some research on certain people that take a lot of credit for what they do.\\xa0 And NIH is giving away a lot of money — a lot of money.\\xa0 We’d give away for years — for many years, they’d give away a lot of money.\\xa0 And some people complain and some people don’t.\\xa0 Some people are extremely happy.\\xa0 So we’re looking into that also.\\n\\nThey’re giving away approximately, as I understand it, recently, more than $32 billion a year.\\xa0 Thirty-two billion.\\xa0 And so we’ve been looking at that for a while, and we’re going to be having some statements to be made about that.\\xa0 Thirty-two billion dollars a year.\\xa0 It’s a lot of money, and we want to make sure it’s being spent wisely.\\xa0 And we’ve been doing that, by the way, and we’ll have some statements on that.\\n\\nAnd those are much bigger numbers then what we’re talking about with national — if you — if you look, with the — with our friends from wherever they come from.\\xa0 You know, 500 — 500 million is a lot of money, but it’s not a lot compared to the kind of money that we give out.\\xa0 I think, over the years, it’s been averaging about 32 billion dollars.\\xa0 Thirty-two billion.\\xa0 So we’ve had our eye on that one for a while.\\n\\nWe also talked about the lab in China where, I guess, $3.7 million was given some time ago.\\xa0 And we’re looking at that very closely.\\xa0 Chief of Staff has that pretty much under control.\\xa0 But it’s money that — too bad it got spent there.\\xa0 But that was spent — what year was that, Mark?\\xa0 That was four or five years ago?\\n\\nMR. MEADOWS:\\xa0 That was over the last six years.\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Six years ago, approximately.\\xa0 So we’re looking at that.\\xa0 And that’s the lab that people are talking about.\\n\\nAll right, so we’re looking at a lot of things.\\xa0 There’s tremendous waste in our government.\\xa0 We found it in many different ways and in many different forms.\\xa0 And this is one of them.\\xa0 This is one of them.\\n\\nWe can spend — I was talking to Dr. Birx — we can spend $500 million using all of it in a much more efficient manner if we’re — if we choose to do that.\\xa0 And it’ll be to the good of many more people than are getting it right now.\\n\\nBut you look at the mistakes that were made — I mean, so late, long after I said we have to close off our country.\\xa0 They were actually against our closing off our country to China.\\xa0 When I did that in January, they were against that.\\xa0 They didn’t like the idea of closing off our country.\\xa0 They said it was a bad thing to do, actually, and they’ve since taken that back.\\xa0 But it was a very lucky thing that we did it.\\xa0 Very lucky.\\xa0 We would have had numbers that were very significantly greater.\\xa0 Tony Fauci said that.\\xa0 He said it would have been very significantly greater had we not done that.\\n\\nSo we’ve made a lot of moves that were good moves, but it’s still a very depressing subject because it’s a lot of death.\\xa0 And if it was stopped very early on at the source, before it started blowing into these proportions, you have 184 countries that would have been in a lot better shape.\\xa0 But our country is getting back, and I expect that we’re going to be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before.\\n\\nAll right, we’ll take a few questions.\\xa0 Jeff.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you’ve mentioned and the Doctor has mentioned China a few times today, that — clearly suggesting that the data has not been good and (inaudible) —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, you tell me: Do you think their data is good, when you see that?\\xa0 Do you think that — do you think that’s correct?\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It was — it was a pretty —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Do you honestly believe that’s correct?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It was a pretty dramatic contrast.\\xa0 So my question for your, sir —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Dramatic?\\xa0 Yeah, I’d say it’s dramatic.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So my question for you, sir, is —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Why didn’t the — why didn’t the press — why didn’t you people figure that out though?\\xa0 Why do we have to put up a chart?\\xa0 It’s — the number is imposs- — it’s an impossible number to hit.\\xa0 But why haven’t you come up and said that?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The question, sir, is: Is China now cooperating with the United States to figure out what happened?\\xa0 And what do you want from them now?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they said they’re doing an investigation — that they’re doing an investigation.\\xa0 So let’s see what happens with their investigation.\\xa0 But we’re doing investigations also.\\n\\nYeah, go ahead.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 You’ve spoken — we heard Dr. Birx, a moment ago, say that every country has a responsibility to tell the rest of the world what’s going on.\\xa0 You’ve talked repeatedly about how this could have been stopped in the past.\\xa0 I know you don’t want to telegraph what you would do, but do you think that there should be some consequences if, in the end, you know, China was responsible for all of this?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, if they were knowingly responsible, certainly.\\xa0 If they did — if it was a mistake: a mistake is a mistake.\\xa0 But if it were knowingly responsible, yeah, then there should be consequences.\\xa0 You’re talking about, you know, potentially lives like nobody has seen since 1917.\\n\\nAnd, you know, the other thing, had we not done what we did in terms of closing — because there is that concept of, “Let’s let it ride.”\\xa0 But I’m — at some point, I’m going to have to — I don’t want to embarrass countries that I like and leaders that I like, but you have to see some of these numbers.\\n\\nIn my opinion — so we’re talking about maybe 60,000 or so; that’s a lot of people.\\xa0 But that’s — 100,000 was the minimum we thought that we could get to, and we — we will be lower than that number.\\xa0 Anywhere from 100 to 220,000 people.\\xa0 But I really believe it could have been millions of people had we not done what we did.\\xa0 We made a lot of good decisions, but one of those things.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But have you ruled out that this was an unknowing situation?\\xa0 Have you ruled out that there was —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I haven’t ruled out anything.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I want to look at the facts as they come in.\\xa0 No, I want to look at the facts.\\n\\nPlease.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 Thank you very much, Mr. President.\\xa0 Last week, you claimed that you were in charge of everything.\\xa0 Yet, the American people don’t understand why you’re unwilling to use the awesome powers of your presidency to make American companies manufacture the PPE and also the testing equipment that you need —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Who are with?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — to implement — to implement your recommendations —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I know, but who are you with?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — of how — I’m with TMN.\\xa0 Recommendations for —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 TMN.\\xa0 What is TMN?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Talk Media News.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 What?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 My name is Doug Christian with Talk Media News.\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Talk Media News.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 And so anyway —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Keep reading your question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The thing is, how to make companies build these testing equipment so that you can do what you want or what you recommended.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re doing that.\\xa0 We’re doing — we’re doing it.\\xa0 We’re doing it right now with ventilators.\\xa0 We have General Motors.\\xa0 We have General Electric.\\xa0 We have 11 different companies — great companies — building them for us all over the United States.\\xa0 We’re starting to make our own gowns, as they call it.\\xa0 We’re making some incredible things.\\n\\nAnd as far as the testing is concerned, most of that now is done in the United States.\\xa0 We’re doing it in the United States on different platforms.\\n\\nAnd so I just don’t think you were listening.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But senators who are complaining to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Which senators?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — to Vice President Pence yesterday —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Which senators?\\xa0 Which senators?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, independent Senator Angus King was —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But he’s not an independent, okay?\\xa0 Angus King is worse than any Democrat.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But he — but he said that he was — that he was livid, actually, at this —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Of course he said that, because he’s a — he’s a Democrat.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 Angus King is not an independent.\\xa0 He uses that term for whatever reason.\\xa0 It’s a waste of time.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But he’s not a very emotive-type of senator.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, yes, he is.\\xa0 You haven’t seen him.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 You haven’t seen him.\\xa0 No, Angus King is a Democrat, and that was totally staged.\\xa0 I heard that, and it was totally staged.\\xa0 Just like you read the question, he read his question.\\n\\nYeah, please, in the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about one of your retweets that you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Which one?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The one you retweeted from Paul Sperry: “Let’s see if authorities enforce the social-distancing orders for mosques during Ramadan…like they did churches during Easter.”\\xa0 I’m wondering —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah — no, I would like to see that.\\xa0 And, you know, I just spoke with leaders and people that love mosques; they love mosques, and I’m all in favor of that.\\xa0 But I would say that there could be a difference.\\xa0 And we’ll have to see what will happen, because I’ve seen a great disparity in this country.\\xa0 I’ve seen a great disparity.\\n\\nI mean, I’ve seen a very strong anti-Israel bent in Congress with Democrats.\\xa0 It — it was unthinkable 7 or 8 or 10 years ago.\\xa0 And now they’re into a whole different thing between Omar and AOC — I say AOC plus three.\\xa0 Add them on.\\xa0 You have — I mean, the things that they say about Israel are so bad.\\xa0 And I — I can’t believe it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Now — just a minute.\\xa0 So I would be interested to see that, because they go after Christian churches, but they don’t tend to go after mosques.\\xa0 And I don’t want them to go after mosques, but I do want to see what their — what their bent is.\\n\\nYes, please, in the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible) Mr. President, that, in fact, are you suggesting —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — that imams wouldn’t follow social distancing?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I — I think that — I just had a call imams.\\xa0 I just had a call with ministers, rabbis.\\xa0 We had a tremendous call with the faith leaders.\\xa0 No, I don’t think that at all.\\n\\nI am somebody that believes in faith.\\xa0 And it matters not what your faith is, but our politicians seem to treat different faiths very differently.\\xa0 And they seem to think — and I don’t know what happened with our country, but the Christian faith is treated much differently than it was.\\xa0 And I think it’s treated very unfairly.\\n\\nYes, please, go ahead.\\xa0 In the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And I just want to ask —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Let’s go.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — if the Department of Justice will, in fact, support —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Jenn Pellegrino with OAN.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 OAN, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 OAN.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 The Paycheck Protection Program saved an estimated 15 million jobs.\\xa0 It’s run out of money.\\xa0 The Democrats — specifically Nancy Pelosi — have been blocking that funding.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you know why Speaker Pelosi is dragging her feet on that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, she thinks it’s politics.\\xa0 I don’t think it’s good politics.\\xa0 Nancy Pelosi has been blocking it.\\xa0 Schumer has been blocking it.\\xa0 And I think they think it’s good politics.\\xa0 I don’t think it’s good politics;\\xa0I think it’s bad politics.\\xa0 But I don’t care about the politics.\\n\\nIt’s so great for our country because we’re going to have all of these companies that are — you know, it’s a bigger employer — let’s say it’s the same, but essentially, it’s the same power — all of these small businesses added together — as the big companies.\\xa0 It’s about 50/50.\\xa0 And it’s so important.\\xa0 And they would be scattered if we weren’t able to do what we’re doing.\\n\\nAnd, essentially, we’re giving these small businesses that won’t make it — they can’t because they’re closed — we’re giving them money to take care of their employees, so when we open, they can get back into business.\\xa0 It’s been a very popular plan, even with Democrats.\\xa0 I think it basically passed unanimously twice — the first section — which is $350 billion.\\xa0 So we’re trying to get $250 [billion].\\n\\nNancy Pelosi is blocking it.\\xa0 She sits in her house in San Francisco, overlooking the ocean, and she doesn’t want to come back.\\xa0 She doesn’t want to come back.\\xa0 She doesn’t want to come back to D.C.\\xa0 She’s got to get back and get this thing approved.\\xa0 It’s very important.\\n\\nPlease.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Birx, if I may: You again praised the American people for doing their bit over the past few weeks.\\xa0 But what goes through your mind when you see photographs of crowded beaches in Florida?\\xa0 Is that a concern for when we start seeing some of these restrictions being lifted?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Well, as I described, we go metro by metro, county by county, and so I’d have to link that with a specific county and look at their case rates.\\n\\nI believe the governor and the public health system that Florida has — they have some of the best county public health individuals I have ever had to deal with — they are amazing — because I had to work with them under HIV/AIDS.\\n\\nSo if the health — if the county health directors believe that that’s appropriate for their county, then I’m not going to second-judge an individual’s approach to this, because every — I can’t see into every single county and low — the low rates.\\xa0 I can just see there’s no cases.\\xa0 So I don’t know if that’s a county with very small cases or not, but I think their county health official would know.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And many of the counties, as you know, are really free of this horrible enemy.\\xa0 So we’re opening up.\\xa0 You’ll be seeing a lot of this country start to open up fairly quickly.\\n\\nYes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 You mentioned the importance of social distancing, but, for example, Stephen Moore — someone you appointed to your “Open the Country” task force — is organizing a protest in Wisconsin.\\xa0 But aren’t they, in a sense, protesting your very own guidelines?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we have a flexibility.\\xa0 I didn’t see what Stephen said.\\xa0 I can tell you he’s a very good economist.\\xa0 He’s been calling shots right —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, he said — he said — sorry, he said, “We need to be the Rosa Parks of government injustices.”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, there is a lot of injustice.\\xa0 When you look at Virginia, where they want to take your guns away, they want to violate your Second Amendment; when you look at — I mean, look, I’m getting along very nicely with the governor of Michigan, but she has things — don’t buy paint, don’t buy roses, don’t buy — I mean, she’s got all these crazy things.\\xa0 I really believe somebody sitting in their boat, in a lake, should be okay.\\xa0 They shouldn’t arrest people.\\xa0 Some of them are being unreasonable.\\xa0 I really believe that.\\xa0 They’re being unreasonable.\\n\\nBut I think Virginia is a great case, though, because they’re using this — they’re trying to take your guns away in Virginia.\\xa0 And if people in Virginia aren’t — aren’t careful, that’s what’s going to happen to them.\\n\\nSo, yeah, I mean, I could see where he’s coming from.\\xa0 I think it’s a strong statement — a strong statement — because hopefully this will be over very soon for all of us.\\xa0 But some have gotten carried away.\\xa0 They have absolutely gotten carried away.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you feel, though, some of these protesters are protesting your social distancing guidelines?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 I mean, I notice there were a lot of protests out there.\\xa0 And I just think that some of the governors have gotten carried away.\\n\\nYou know, we have a lot of people that don’t have to be told to do what they’re doing.\\xa0 They’ve been really doing everything we’ve asked them.\\xa0 We have a few states where, frankly, I spoke to the governors and I could have gotten them to do — if I wanted — to do what would have been, perhaps, politically correct.\\xa0 But they’ve been doing incredibly anyway.\\n\\nAnd as one of them said, everybody is doing exactly the same.\\xa0 In fact, our record is better than states where they’re under a mandate or, you know, where they’ve agreed to do certain things.\\n\\nNo, we have some great states out there, and we have incredible people in our country.\\xa0 And for the most part, that — it’s a strong statement, but I understand where he’s coming from.\\n\\nAnd I think one of the greats would be — one of the really important places that people really have to start looking at is what’s going on in Virginia, because that’s a mess, where the gover- — with, really, a governor that’s under siege anyway.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, with the beautiful head of white hair.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 I’ll tell you if I like his hair in about a minute, after he asks the question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Gordon Lubold with the Wall Street Journal.\\xa0 On that point though, does the tweeting about, in the case of Virginia, linking the Second Amendment to some of these issues about lifting some of these restrictions in these states —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — not — potentially pose concern for the governors and civil unrest, and potentially in those cases?\\n\\nAnd I have a second question for you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think, just for that question, I think that’s an easy one.\\xa0 That’s not even politics.\\xa0 We’re entitled to a Second Amendment, and he’s trying to take the Second Amendment.\\xa0 Meaning, that state is trying to take — the Democrats in that state — the Republicans are fighting it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They’re trying to take that — that Second Amendment right — that Second Amendment right away.\\xa0 To me, that’s liberty.\\xa0 That’s — when I say, “liberate Virginia,” I would say, liberate Virginia when that kind of thing happens.\\xa0 And where does it all stop?\\xa0 So I think it’s a very good analogy.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, I’m just — I mean, is this the right time to, kind of, bring in a Second Amendment issue (inaudible) —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think when they talk about taking your guns away — and if you notice, at the beginning of this pandemic, there were more guns sold, I think, than at almost any time in history, because — so it’s obviously a big issue.\\xa0 And then you have them working and signing documents, trying to take your — your Second Amendment away, essentially.\\xa0 So I do think it’s an appropriate time to bring it up.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I ask my second question?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Second.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This past week, after an extraordinary slew of events from adversaries — North Korea, Russia —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — China and Iran — all, kind of, pushing back on U.S. policy or toying with U.S. military forces, what’s your messages to these countries who may be trying to take advantage?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t — I don’t see it.\\xa0 No, I don’t see it.\\xa0 We had a very good relationship with Russia.\\xa0 We worked on the oil deal together.\\xa0 I was with —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — by telephone, the King of Saudi Arabia and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin.\\xa0 We worked out a deal on oil.\\xa0 That was a very important deal to them and to us and to Saudi Arabia.\\xa0 It was in a deadlock.\\xa0 You know it; you covered it very well.\\xa0 Actually, the Wall Street Journal covered that very well.\\n\\nI worked with Putin and with the King on that.\\xa0 And President Putin was a total gentleman, and it was very important to get that done.\\xa0 And the King was great.\\xa0 And we actually had to bring in Mexico, because Mexico was a lone holdout and they showed great flexibility.\\xa0 You know the story.\\n\\nNo, I think we’re doing fine.\\xa0 Yeah, sure, it’s — North Korea, I see they’re testing short-range missiles.\\xa0 And, you know, they’ve been doing it a long time.\\xa0 I received a nice note from him recently.\\xa0 It was a nice note.\\xa0 I think we’re doing fine.\\n\\nLook, if I wasn’t elected, you would, right now, be at war with North Korea.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 I’ll tell you, for your people that don’t understand the world and they don’t understand how life works: If I wasn’t elected, you would, right now — maybe the war would be over, hopefully with a victory.\\n\\nBut if you remember, when I first came in, we didn’t have ammunition.\\xa0 Not a good way to fight a war.\\xa0 President Obama left us no ammunition.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 And he left us virtually no medical and ventilators.\\xa0 He left us — the cupboard was dry, right?\\xa0 The cupboard was dry.\\n\\nNo, I think, right now, you’d be at war, essentially — in some form — it would be over, it would be raging — with North Korea, if I weren’t President.\\xa0 And we’re doing just fine with North Korea.\\xa0 Just fine.\\xa0 We’ll see how it all ends up.\\n\\nYou know, in the meantime, they said, “Oh, Trump has given up.”\\xa0 And then they said “Oh, really, what’s he given up?”\\xa0 And they said, “I don’t know.”\\xa0 Then they said, “He met.”\\xa0 Oh, I met.\\xa0 I met.\\n\\nNo, I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un.\\xa0 That’s not a bad thing to have a good relationship.\\xa0 Obama wanted a relationship; he wouldn’t meet with Obama.\\xa0 Wouldn’t meet with him.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 I have a good relationship with him.\\xa0 We met at the line.\\xa0 I stepped over the line.\\xa0 The first time anything like that’s ever — it’s all good.\\xa0 It’s just — it’s good.\\n\\nBut when they say — the stupid people — I call them “stupid people” or “the haters.”\\xa0 They say, “Trump has given up so much.”\\xa0 Really?\\xa0 I’ve actually increased the sanctions.\\xa0 China has been very good on the border.\\xa0 In fact, right now, the border is stone-cold closed between China and North Korea.\\n\\nOur relationship with China was good until they did this.\\xa0 Once we found out about this — once we found out — look, we just made a trade deal where China is going to have to buy $250 billion a year on our product.\\xa0 Fifty billion from the farmers.\\xa0 Forty to fifty billion from the farmers.\\xa0 The relationship was good when we were signing that, but then all of a sudden, you hear about this.\\n\\nSo it’s a big — it’s a big difference.\\xa0 You know, the question was asked, “Would you be angry at China?”\\xa0 Well, the answer might very well be a very resounding “yes,” but it depends: Was it a mistake that got out of control or was it done deliberately?\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 That’s a big difference between those two.\\xa0 In either event, they should have let us go in.\\xa0 You know, we asked to go in very early, and they didn’t want us in.\\xa0 I think they were embarrassed.\\xa0 I think they knew it was something bad, and I think they were embarrassed.\\n\\nBut, you know — no, I think we’re doing very well.\\n\\nWell, it’s — so you said Russia, you said China —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Iran.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — you said North Korea.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And Iran.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Iran?\\xa0 When I came in, Iran was a terror.\\xa0 We had 82 points of fighting.\\xa0 We had 18 points of major confliction.\\xa0 The first week, I said, “Tell me about Iran.”\\xa0 “Sir, we have 18 points of confliction.”\\xa0 Meaning, Yemen and Syria and all — Iraq.\\xa0 They were going into Iraq all over the place.\\xa0 They’re a much a different nation right now.\\xa0 I stopped that horrible deal.\\xa0 Horrible deal.\\n\\nAnd they want to talk, except that Kerry violated the Logan Act.\\xa0 He made the deal, and doesn’t want them to make a deal because — I would have made a deal, in my opinion, except that John Kerry, when he — who made the deal originally, which was a stupid deal to make.\\xa0 Gave them $150 billion.\\xa0 Gave 1.8 billion in cash, in green.\\xa0 That would be more than this room, 10 times, with hundred-dollar bills.\\xa0 That you could fill up this room 10 times with hundred-dollar bills.\\xa0 And it’s not that small a room.\\n\\nAnd I say he violated the Logan Act.\\xa0 I think it was a major violation.\\xa0 I think we would have had a deal if it wasn’t for John Kerry.\\xa0 But he doesn’t want to be, number one, embarrassed.\\xa0 Number two, he said, “Let’s wait until after the election.\\xa0 Maybe Sleep Joe Biden is going to win.\\xa0 And if Sleep Joe Biden wins, you’ll own the United States.”\\n\\nAnd China will own the United States.\\xa0 China has paid us — you know, from the Wall Street Journal — hundreds of billions of dollars — is that right? — tariffs.\\xa0 And we gave a lot of that money — a small percentage — but a lot of money to the farmers, and it kept the farmers going great.\\xa0 All right?\\xa0 But hundreds — we get — we’re getting tens of billions of dollars in tariffs.\\n\\nAnd, by the way, for those of you that say, “Oh we’re paying,” China devalued their currency in order to pay these.\\xa0 We didn’t pay.\\xa0 China paid.\\xa0 They don’t like to write that.\\xa0 They also added money into their system.\\xa0 So they paid for that.\\n\\nNo, I think you have numerous countries waiting to see whether or not Sleepy Joe wins, because if Sleepy Joe won, they own our country.\\xa0 They will take our country.\\n\\nYou know, we had — go back two months — we had, by far — and China was supposed to catch us.\\xa0 You know better than anybody, Wall Street Journal.\\xa0 For years, I’ve heard, “By 2019, China will catch us.”\\xa0 There’s only one problem: Trump got elected in 2016.\\xa0 That was a big difference.\\xa0 And we were going leaps and bounds above China.\\n\\nAnd before the problem with the plague — right? — China was having the worst year they’ve had in 67 years.\\xa0 That was before the plague.\\xa0 Now they’re getting really hurt, and so is everybody getting hurt.\\xa0 I don’t want them to get hurt, but they’re all getting hurt.\\xa0 Everybody is getting hurt.\\xa0 It’s a horrible thing that’s happened.\\xa0 But we had the greatest economy in the world, by far.\\xa0 China isn’t even close — go back two months — and we’re going to keep it that way.\\n\\nBut when you mention Iran, Iran is a much different country than it was.\\xa0 When I first came in, Iran was going to take over the entire Middle East.\\xa0 Right now, they just want to survive.\\xa0 They’re having protests every week.\\xa0 They’re loaded up with the plague — which I don’t want; I’ve offered to help them if they want.\\xa0 If they need ventilators, which they do, I would send them ventilators.\\xa0 We have thousands of excess ventilators coming in and here.\\n\\nWe have a stockpile of ventilators, and we’re starting to send them so that hospitals can fill up their stockpile, which they should have.\\xa0 New York had a chance to get 16,000 ventilators, and they chose not to do it.\\xa0 And I understand that.\\xa0 It’s a hard decision for a thing that may or may not happen.\\xa0 I fully understand that.\\xa0 I’m not even complaining about that.\\n\\nI’m only saying this: Iran was a terror when I came into office.\\xa0 Right now, they don’t want to mess around with us.\\xa0 They don’t want to mess around with us.\\n\\nTwo things: North Korea, same sanctions we’ve always had, except more.\\xa0 We haven’t given anything.\\xa0 I think you’ll hopefully take that back to the Wall Street Journal, because they really don’t understand it. \\xa0They really don’t.\\n\\nAnd with — with Iran, I mean, that’s a different country right now.\\xa0 And they want to make a deal.\\xa0 The only reason they don’t — they’re being shamed in, because the guy that gave them the sweetheart, didn’t want to.\\xa0 Met with them many times.\\xa0 He should have never met with them.\\xa0 And in my opinion, he’s telling them, “Don’t.\\xa0 Wait.\\xa0 Maybe Trump will lose and then you can negotiate with a patsy, with a weak guy.\\xa0 And you’ll take over the — between you and Russia…”\\xa0 Nobody has been tougher on Putin.\\xa0 He knows it better than anybody.\\xa0 Nobody been tougher on Putin than me.\\xa0 Look at the sanctions.\\n\\nLook at what I did with their pipeline going into Europe.\\xa0 Nobody even knew about it.\\xa0 I exposed it.\\xa0 Now everybody talks about it.\\xa0 I think it’s a terrible thing for Germany to do.\\n\\nBut at the same time, I have a very good relationship with Putin, and I was able to get — I was able to make a deal with Russia and Saudi Arabia and OPEC Plus.\\xa0 They call “OPEC Plus.”\\xa0 That’s going to save us Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, other states, energy states.\\xa0 Going to save us hundreds of thousands of jobs.\\n\\nAnd, in fact, your paper wrote an incredible editorial, for a change, that “Trump made a great deal for our country.”\\xa0 That was a nice thing.\\xa0 I was shocked to see it coming out of the Wall Street Journal.\\n\\nThank you all very much.\\xa0 We’ll see you tomorrow.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\n\\nEND\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\n\\n6:16 P.M.

       "  'text': '6:22 P.M. EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 I just had a great conversation with the leading faith leaders of our country.\\xa0 It went extremely well.\\xa0 We learned a lot.\\xa0 I learned a lot.\\xa0 And we’re working on some things that are very interesting and very positive.\\xa0 I thank them all for being on the call.\\n\\nAnd yesterday, we unveiled detailed guidelines for America’s governors to initiate a phased, safe, and gradual reopening of America.\\xa0 That’s what’s happening.\\xa0 The guidelines provide governors with the fact-driven and science-based metrics they will need to make the decisions that are right for their own particular state.\\n\\nTo view the guidelines, you can go to the website at Whitehouse.gov/OpeningAmerica.\\xa0 So that’s Whitehouse.gov/OpeningAmerica.\\n\\nTreasury has sent out economic relief payments to more than 80 million Americans who have their direct deposit information on file with the IRS.\\xa0 And an incredible success it has been.\\xa0 If you have not received your check, please visit IRS.gov/GetMyPayment.\\xa0 How about that one?\\xa0 IRS.gov/GetMyPayment.\\xa0 That way, the IRS can get you your payment in days — and they’ve done a fantastic job, I have to say — and you won’t have to wait for a check in the mail.\\n\\nI have some very good news: We sent out 80 million deposits, and less than 1 percent had even little problems.\\xa0 A couple had minor glitches, but it’s substantially less than 1 percent.\\xa0 So out of 80 million deposits, less than 1 percent.\\xa0 And that gets corrected immediately.\\xa0 So just please do as I say.\\xa0 You’ll get that very quickly, very easily.\\n\\nToday, I’m also announcing that Secretary Perdue — who happens to be right next to me; handsome man — and the Department of Agriculture will be implementing a 19-billion-dollar relief program for our great farmers and ranchers as they cope with the fallout of the global pandemic.\\xa0 Very honored to be doing this.\\xa0 Our farmers, ranchers — we have — these are great people, great Americans.\\xa0 Never complain.\\xa0 They never complain.\\xa0 They just do what they have to do.\\n\\nThe program will include direct payments to farmers as well as mass purchases of dairy, meat, and agricultural produce to get that food to the people in need.\\n\\nThe USDA will receive another $14 billion in July that will have funding to continue help our — helping.\\xa0 And this will help our farmers and our ranchers, and it’s money well deserved.\\xa0 So not only were they targeted at one point by China — and that was over a period of time, and you saw that happening.\\xa0 And they never complained, but that worked out very well.\\xa0 Twelve billion dollars they got, and sixteen billion dollars they got.\\xa0 And now it’s $19 billion.\\n\\nAnd I’m just going to ask Secretary Perdue to explain\\nexactly how we’re going to handle it.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nSECRETARY PERDUE:\\xa0 Well, Mr. President, you may remember earlier this year, you tweeted a message to our farmers and ranchers that, no matter their circumstances, you pledged to stand behind them.\\xa0 And while none of us could ever have anticipated this type of pandemic that we’re currently in, I think today’s announcement is proof that you’ve put our — you have our farmers’ backs and that you will continue to do what it takes to support them.\\xa0 And they are very grateful.\\n\\nWe’ve heard a lot recently — all of you — about our food supply chain.\\xa0 I think America now knows that, more than ever, the wholesome food that our families depend upon, it starts with America’s farmers and ranchers.\\xa0 America agriculture has been hard hit, like most of America, with the coronavirus, and President Trump is standing with our farmers and all Americans to make sure we all get through this national emergency.\\n\\nSo today, thanks to your direction and leadership, Mr. President, USDA is announcing the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program.\\xa0 As you mentioned, this new 19-billion-dollar program will take several immediate actions to assist farmers, ranchers, and consumers in response to the COVID-19 national emergency.\\n\\nThe program is really divided into two parts.\\xa0 One is a direct payment — $16 billion in direct payments to farmers, ranchers, and producers who have experienced unprecedented losses during this pandemic.\\n\\nSince we wanted to get the payments out to producers as quickly as possible, we decided to use the funds in the CCC — the current funds of 6.5 million — billion dollars, combined with the 19.5 of COVID money, rather than wait for the replenishment of the CCC funds in July.\\xa0 Based on industry estimates of damage, Mr. President, it is becoming apparent that we’ll need the additional CCC funds as we continue to track the economic losses.\\n\\nSecondly — and this is really important as well — the USDA will be purchasing $3 billion in fresh produce, dairy, and meat products to be distributed to Americans in need through our food bank networks, as well as other community and faith-based organizations.\\xa0 Having to dump milk or plow under vegetables ready to market is not only financially distressing, but it’s heartbreaking, as well, to those who produce them.\\n\\nThis program will not only provide direct financial relief to our farmers and ranchers, Mr. President, who will allow for the purchase and distribution of our agricultural abundance in this country to help our fellow Americans in need.\\n\\nSo in recent weeks, we’ve seen — all of us seen the heroic patriotism of our food supply-chain workers, and they’ve shown, day in and day out, doing the work to serve the needs of fellow Americans.\\n\\nOur farmers have been in the fields planting and doing what they do every spring to feed the American people, even with a pandemic, as we speak.\\n\\nI want to thank you, Mr. President, for your unwavering support.\\xa0 They want to thank you for your unwavering support for America’s farmers and ranchers.\\xa0 And I want to commit to you, Mr. President, and to the American people that USDA will do everything in our power to implement this program as quickly and as efficiently as possible to help our farmers, ranchers, producers, and consumers during this great time of need.\\n\\nSo thank you very much for having me here today.\\xa0 And God bless you.\\xa0 God bless America.\\xa0 God bless American agriculture.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Thank you very much, Sonny.\\xa0 Fantastic job.\\xa0 Thank you, Sonny.\\n\\nSo, our great Secretary of Agriculture was the governor of Georgia for eight years, and the only reason he isn’t still there, frankly, is that he was term limited.\\xa0 And I said, “Let’s get him for agriculture.”\\xa0 And you’ve done a fantastic job.\\xa0 We want to thank you very much.\\xa0 Eight years at Georgia.\\xa0 We really appreciate it.\\xa0 Great job.\\n\\nEven as we prepare to rebuild our economy, America continues to wage an all-out medical war to defeat the invisible enemy.\\xa0 To date, we have conducted more than 3.78 million coronavirus tests — by far, the most of any country; it’s not even close.\\xa0 In the hardest-hit areas, such as New York and Louisiana, we’ve also tested more people per capita than South Korea, Singapore, and every other country.\\n\\nThe United States has the most robust, advanced, and accurate testing system anywhere in the world.\\xa0 As of yesterday, we have distributed nearly 660,000 Abbott IDs.\\xa0 Now, that’s a — an incredible test.\\xa0 It’s called the ID NOW point-of-care diagnostic test.\\xa0 And it’s fantastic.\\xa0 It’s a hot — it’s the hot one.\\xa0 The problem with this business is it’s the hot one until about two days from now, because we do have a saliva test that just came out, and that can be self-administered, and it’s said to be fantastic.\\n\\nI want to thank Abbott Laboratories.\\xa0 They have been incredible.\\xa0 I want to thank Roche.\\xa0 They’ve likewise been incredible.\\n\\nOver the last several days, we’ve seen a dramatic increase in the number of tests conducted by hospitals and academic institutions, which have now performed nearly 600,000 tests.\\xa0 There is a tremendous amount of unused capacity in the states available for governors to tap.\\xa0 We have tremendous unused capability within those laboratories, and I hope the governors are going to be able to use them.\\xa0 The governors are responsible for testing, and I hope they’re going to be able to use this tremendous amount of available capacity that we have.\\n\\nIt’s up to 1 million additional tests per week — when you think of that.\\xa0 In the next few weeks, we’ll be sending out 5.5 million testing swabs to the states.\\xa0 Swabs can be done easily by the governors themselves.\\xa0 Mostly, it’s cotton.\\xa0 It’s not a big deal.\\xa0 You can get cotton easily.\\xa0 But if they can’t get it, we will take care of it.\\n\\nYesterday, the FDA announced a new collaboration with United Health Group, the Gates Foundation, Quantigen, and U.S. Cotton to greatly expand the supply of essential swabs, including a new polyester Q-tip-type swab for the coronavirus testing.\\xa0 All of these actions will help our testing capability continue to grow dramatically.\\n\\nSo we’re helping people, even with swabs.\\xa0 We get ventilators.\\xa0 We’re now the king of ventilators.\\xa0 We have hundreds of thousands under construction.\\xa0 We don’t need them ourselves.\\xa0 The governors are in great shape.\\xa0 If we do, we have a great stockpile that we’ll immediately send to the state in need.\\xa0 But we’ve handled that situation incredibly well.\\xa0 I hope people understand it.\\xa0 I wish the media would get the word out.\\xa0 What we’ve done in ventilators is amazing, because they’re big, expensive, and highly complex.\\n\\nWe’re speaking to other countries.\\xa0 I spoke to the President of Mexico today — a great gentleman — and I told him that we are going to be helping him out with ventilators, helping Mexico out.\\xa0 And we’ll be helping some other countries too.\\xa0 We have a lot of very high-level, high-quality ventilators.\\xa0 And they’re here, and they’re also being manufactured as we speak.\\n\\nFollowing the announcement of our reopening guidelines, there have been some very partisan voices in the media and in politics who have spread false and misleading information about our testing capacity — it’s totally false and misleading — demonstrating a complete failure to understand the enormous scope of the testing capabilities that we’ve brought online.\\xa0 And we started, really, from ground zero.\\xa0 We started from really being very, very outdated and obsolete as a country, from the past.\\n\\nAnd I will say this: If they didn’t understand it, it’s just really — unfortunately, I hate to say this because we’ve been getting along very well, but it would be false reporting, because they understand the capability.\\xa0 And it’s going to be up to the states to use that capability.\\xa0 The states have local points where they can go — a governor can call the mayors, and the mayors can call representatives, and everybody — everything is perfect.\\xa0 And that’s the way it should work and always should work.\\n\\nWe’ll help New York and all of the other states get even better on their testing.\\xa0 We have to get even better.\\xa0 And some people think a little bit differently.\\xa0 There are areas where you have vast amounts of area where you have very few people and almost no people are infected.\\xa0 And those places will be looked upon differently by different governors.\\xa0 And I think you’re going to have a lot of news coming out about that over the next few days.\\xa0 I think certain states are going to come online, and they’re going to start the early stages of the puzzle that we’re putting together.\\xa0 And it’s going to be together sooner rather than later.\\xa0 A lot of really incredible things are happening.\\n\\nAnd at some point in the not-too-distant future, we’re going to have our country back.\\xa0 And it’s going to be, I think, really — with what we’re doing on stimulus, and helping people keep their businesses together and their lives together and their jobs, it’s going to be better than ever before.\\xa0 I hope so.\\xa0 I really do.\\n\\nThe current conversation is reminiscent of what happened on ventilators — you remember that — when requests were made far beyond what was objectively needed.\\xa0 We were hearing from a certain state and we were hearing from a lot that they needed far more ventilators.\\xa0 In one case, they wanted 40,000 ventilators — 40,000.\\xa0 It turned out that they had plenty and they had a number of about 7- or 8,000, and that was plenty.\\xa0 We supplied them with a lot.\\xa0 But that was the right number; we got it just about right.\\xa0 And if they did need more, we’re ready to give more, but I think the surge seems to be over.\\n\\nAnd there are a lot of governors just doing a great job.\\xa0 And they’re working with us, but we’re all working together.\\n\\nThe research and development that we’ve done at the federal level has been absolutely incredible.\\xa0 The media will be accepting of these figures when they get to see the end result.\\xa0 I think they’re going to see it and I think they’re already seeing it.\\xa0 That includes not only ventilators, but beds.\\xa0 We’ve built, in most cases, far more than they even needed, but we wanted to err on the side of caution.\\n\\nThis is what the governors wanted.\\xa0 They wanted a certain amount in Louisiana.\\xa0 I spoke with the governor; I had a long talk with him.\\xa0 And I said, “Do you think you’ll need that final hospital?”\\xa0 And they actually didn’t need it.\\xa0 We built a lot of — a lot of beds.\\xa0 So, I appreciate it, from the governor.\\n\\nAnd we saved — building a hospital in New York, we did a — I think, just a spectacular job at the Javits Center.\\xa0 And even sending the ship up became — we brought it into COVID, but they didn’t — they didn’t really need it.\\xa0 It didn’t get much use, but it was there and ready.\\xa0 It wasn’t supposed to be used for that purpose; we changed it into that purpose.\\xa0 And it was there — ready, willing, and able.\\xa0 Same with Javits, but they didn’t quite need the rooms that we — the beds that we — we produced.\\n\\nSo we produced almost 2,900 beds, and I think I’d rather tell you that we were over-prepared that we were — than we were underprepared.\\xa0 And that was a good-faith effort by New York, I have to say that.\\xa0 A very good faith effort.\\xa0 But it’s nice that we didn’t need that, instead of needing it.\\xa0 It was not very occupied, but it was ready to go.\\xa0 It’s still there should something happen, but I think they have it under very good control.\\n\\nAs you’ll hear from our experts today, we’ve already built sufficient testing capacity nationwide for states to begin their reopenings.\\xa0 And I think you’ll be hearing a lot about reopenings in the coming weeks and months. \\xa0Most excitingly, in the coming weeks, I think you’re going to see some very, very dramatic steps taken and very safely.\\xa0 We’re putting safety first.\\xa0 We may be opening, but we’re putting safety first.\\n\\nAnd when you look at the numbers, when you look at the possible number of death — deaths at 2.2 million people — and it could have very well been that.\\xa0 It could have been more.\\xa0 Frankly, I’ve been looking at numbers where it could have been higher than that — 2.2 million people dying.\\xa0 If you figure we lost 500,000, maybe 600,000 in the Civil War.\\xa0 2.2 million people.\\n\\nA minimum, if we did nothing, would have been 1.6 [million].\\xa0 If you cut that in half, you’re talking about 800,000, 900,000, a million people dying.\\xa0 But we did a lot of work, and the people of this country were incredible, I have to say.\\xa0 And I think we’re heading to the other category, and that would be if we did work and if it was successful, they had between 100,000 and 220,000 to 240,000 on the upside.\\xa0 And I think we’ll be substantially, hopefully, below the hundred number.\\xa0 And I think, right now, we’re heading at probably around 60-, maybe 65,000.\\n\\nAnd one is too many.\\xa0 I always say it: One is too many.\\xa0 This is a horrible thing that happened to our country.\\xa0 This is a horrible thing that happened to 184 countries all over the world.\\xa0 This is a horrible thing, and there was no reason for it.\\xa0 It should never, ever happen again.\\n\\nIn a few minutes, you’ll be hearing from Dr. Redfield, Dr.\\xa0Fauci, Dr. Birx, and Admiral Giroir to explain these facts in — in really great detail.\\n\\nEarlier this week, the FDA authorized two new antibody tests — which is very exciting — that will determine if someone has been previously infected with the virus, bringing the total to four authorized antibody tests already.\\xa0 This will help us assess the number of cases that have been asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and support our efforts to get Americans back to work by showing us who might have developed the wonderful, beautiful immunity.\\n\\nUltimate victory in this war will be made possible by America’s scientific brilliance.\\xa0 There is nothing like us.\\xa0 There is nobody like us.\\xa0 Not even close.\\xa0 I wish I could tell you stories — what other countries, even powerful countries, say to me — the leaders.\\xa0 They say it quietly and they say it off the record, but they have great respect for what we can do.\\n\\nAnd our country is at a point — a few weeks ago, think of it — four or five weeks ago, we were at a level that nobody had ever attained: the best job numbers we’ve ever had, the best economy we’ve ever had.\\xa0 Every company virtually was doing better business than ever before.\\xa0 The stock market was at all-time highs.\\n\\nAnd then one day, they said, “You got to close it up.”\\xa0 And we did the right thing.\\xa0 We saved maybe millions of lives by doing it the way we did it.\\xa0 But we’re paying a price, but that price is very unimportant compared to the number of lives we’re talking about.\\n\\nThe NIH and others are conducting clinical trials of 35 different therapies and treatments — therapies being so exciting to me, because that’s really like — if something happens, you’re going to get better reasonably quickly and without such a horrible deal, as some people have to go through.\\n\\nTo that end, today NIH announced that it is launching a public-private partnership with more than a dozen biopharmaceutical companies.\\xa0 They’re — HHS, FDA, CDC, and the European Medicines Agency, they’re all working together.\\xa0 We’re working together with a lot of other countries.\\n\\nThe partnership will marshal and coordinate the vast resources, knowledge, assets, and authorities of more than a dozen organizations and agencies to accelerate development of the most promising therapies and vaccines.\\xa0 The vaccines are coming along really, really well.\\xa0 Johnson & Johnson is very well advanced.\\n\\nOne thing is they have to — we’re having great, great success, but we have to test them and it takes a long period of time.\\xa0 It takes probably over a year, unfortunately.\\xa0 But therapies likewise are coming along very, very well.\\xa0 Therapies are immediate.\\xa0 When we get that, that’ll be a big day.\\n\\nWe’re also equipping our medical warriors on the frontlines.\\xa0 In total, we have the Project Air Bridge — and the air bridge has been incredible; the National Strategic Stockpile; and every other channel the federal government has deployed.\\xa0 If you think about this: 44.5 million N95 masks, nearly 524 million gloves, 63.5 million surgical masks, and more than 10 million gowns.\\xa0 And we have 500 million masks coming in very soon, between manufacturing and orders — 500 million masks.\\n\\nThe last few months have been among the most challenging times in the history of our nation.\\xa0 This invisible enemy is tough and it’s smart and it’s vicious.\\xa0 But every day, we’re getting closer to the future that we all have been waiting for.\\xa0 I talk about the light at the end of the tunnel; we are getting very, very close to seeing that light shine very brightly at the end of that tunnel.\\n\\nAnd it’s happening, and I want to thank everybody in the room.\\xa0 I want to thank — I actually want to thank some of the media. \\xa0We’ve had some fair coverage — some really fair coverage — and I appreciate it.\\n\\nWhat I’m going to do is I’m going to introduce our great Vice President, Mike Pence, and he’s going to take over for a little while.\\xa0 I’m going to leave and I’m coming right back, and we’ll take some questions.\\xa0 They’re going to go over our tremendous testing capabilities.\\xa0 And again, I’ll be right back.\\n\\nThank you.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President, and good afternoon all.\\n\\nToday, as the President just reflected, it remains a challenging time in the life of our nation.\\xa0 But because of the extraordinary efforts of the American people, because of the strong partnership the federal government has forged with states across the country, we’re making progress, America.\\n\\nDespite the — the tragic loss of more than 36,000 Americans, according to our best data reporting this morning, we continue to see new cases low and steady on the West Coast.\\xa0 And we continue to see cases and hospitalizations declining in the Greater New York City area, in New Orleans, and Detroit, and elsewhere.\\n\\nThis is a tribute, first and foremost, to our — our healthcare doctors, nurses — all of those working on the frontlines.\\xa0 But it’s also a great tribute to the American people, who have put into practice the social distancing, the guidelines, the guidance of state and local officials.\\xa0 And we — we hope that every American is encouraged by the steady progress that we are making.\\n\\nWe’re continuing to bring, at the President’s direction, the full resources of the federal government to bear.\\xa0 Today, the President approved a major disaster declaration for American Samoa, and now all 50 states and all territories are under major disaster declarations for the first time in American history.\\n\\nAt this present moment, 33,000 National Guardsmen are on duty; 5,500 active duty military personnel have been deployed to 9 states, including 716 medical professionals, doctors, and nurses who deployed out to 14 different hospitals today.\\xa0 Among those were 10 hospitals in New York City.\\xa0 And military personnel were also serving today in hospitals in Connecticut, Texas, Louisiana, and New Jersey.\\n\\nYesterday, as the President reflected, we unveiled the President’s Guidelines for Opening up America Again.\\xa0 There were two parts at the beginning of those guidelines.\\xa0 First, the criteria that we hope will guide governors in their decisions about reopening their states on either a statewide level or a county level.\\xa0 And then also, we outlined what we believe would be the most important state responsibilities to have in place before moving into a reopening plan.\\n\\nFor phase one, the President’s guidelines, you’ll recall it advised that states that have a downward trajectory in cases over a 14-day period of time and ensure that they have proper capacity in their healthcare facilities could move to phase one with the easing of some of the social distancing and the criteria that have been in place.\\n\\nBut for states that meet the criteria, we outlined specific responsibilities protecting workers in critical industries, particularly protecting the most vulnerable, those who live and work in senior care facilities.\\xa0 And we also encouraged states to have a plan for testing symptomatic individuals and ensuring testing to our most vulnerable populations.\\n\\nAs the President has made clear, governors will decide the time and manner that their states reopen, and we will look to support them in that effort.\\xa0 But as we assured the American people yesterday, at the President’s direction, our administration will continue to work with governors across the country to ensure that they have the equipment and the supplies and the testing resources to reopen safely and responsibly.\\n\\nOn the subject of supplies, today we issued a letter to our nation’s governors summarizing all the medical equipment and supplies that have been distributed to their state from FEMA between the first of this month and April 14, through Project Airbridge and through the commercial supply network.\\xa0 We’ll be speaking with our nation’s governors on Monday and detailing that information at that time.\\n\\nAs of April 16th, as the President reflected briefly, FEMA has coordinated the delivery of millions of pieces of medical equipment, including 44 million N95 respirators, 63 million surgical masks, more than 10,000 ventilators, and of course, deployed more than 8,600 federal medical station beds.\\n\\nOn the subject of testing resources, we’re going to take some time to speak about our administration’s approach and partnership with states to continue to expand testing across the country at this briefing.\\n\\nBut from the very outset of this epidemic, President Trump made efforts to essentially reinvent testing in America.\\xa0 The traditional testing in this country that takes place at CDC or at state labs was designed for basically the kind of diagnostic testing that is routinely required.\\xa0 But the President, early on in this effort, brought together the leading commercial labs in America, and we forged a public and private partnership.\\xa0 And six weeks ago, we had performed some 25,000 tests, and at this day, we have performed 3.7 million tests.\\n\\nWe believe that labs and hospitals are now performing more than 120,000 tests a day.\\xa0 And we’ve actually stood up a team from Walter Reed, under the direction of Dr. Deborah Birx, that is working around the clock to identify additional testing capacity across the country.\\xa0 We believe that states could actually more than double the amount of daily testing that is happening today by simply activating all of the labs.\\xa0 And Dr. Birx will detail some of those resources today, and we’ll be going over those very specifically with governors on Monday.\\n\\nWe’ve also been promoting the development of new and innovative tests.\\xa0 We all know about the 15-minute Abbott test, but the FDA is currently working on an antibody test that literally could add 20 million new tests to our supply, even before the end of April.\\n\\nI want to assure the American people that we’re going to continue to work with your governors and with your state health officials to scale testing in the days ahead.\\xa0 But as you’ll hear from all of our experts tonight, our best scientists and health experts assess that states today have enough tests to implement the criteria of phase one, if they choose to do so.\\n\\nLet me say that again: Given the — given the guidance in the President’s new Guidelines for Opening Up America Again, states that meet the criteria for going into phase one, and then are preparing the testing that is contemplated by going to phase one, our best scientists and health experts assess that, today, we have a sufficient amount of testing to meet the requirements of a phase one reopening, if state governors should choose to do that.\\xa0 And you’ll hear more detail on that in just a moment.\\n\\nAt the President’s direction, we’re going to be presenting an outline of our approach to testing in partnership with states, during this briefing.\\xa0 Our approach will continue to be locally executed, state managed, and federally supported.\\n\\nDr. Fauci will give us a brief introduction to the overall approach to testing that is contemplated to deal with the coronavirus.\\xa0 Dr. Redfield and the CDC will describe our plan to mobilize CDC officials in all 50 states to specifically monitor coronavirus — coronavirus incidents that occur in every state in the union.\\n\\nOf course, Dr. Deborah Birx will describe not only our tests, but also the current capability and the capability that we could expand to very readily.\\xa0 And Admiral Giroir of the U.S. Public Health Service will summarize our approach.\\n\\nBut I want to assure the American people that, at the President’s direction, we are going to continue to work every single day to make sure that our states and communities have the testing they need to reopen at the time and manner of their choosing.\\xa0 And we’re going to work every day to make sure our states have the resources and the supplies to reopen their states and reopen America in a safe and responsible way.\\n\\nWith that, Dr. Fauci.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 So, as the Vice President said, I’m going to give you a brief introduction to, kind of, answer the question that we’ve been asked a lot.\\xa0 In fact, we had a very productive teleconference with the Senate Democratic Caucus just a few hours ago, and they asked a number of questions which were really reasonable questions — questions that are on the mind of a lot of different people.\\xa0 And one of them was the question that was just posed a moment ago, is:\\xa0Are there enough tests to allow us to be able to go through this first phase in a way that is protective of the health and the safety of the American people?\\n\\nSo I just want to spend a couple of minutes clarifying a few things and maybe providing some information on a broad 40,000 foot, which you’ll hear some of the more granular details from my colleagues who will be following me.\\xa0 I think they — they asked me to give the “40,000 foot” one because I’m not a testing person; I didn’t run a testing lab, but I’m part of a team that is looking at this of how we can best make sure that this happens in the right way.\\n\\nSo, first of all, let me say something that we’ve said before, and I apologize if I’m repeating things that you already know, but I think in some respects it’s important to do that so that people have clarity in what we’re talking about.\\n\\nThere are two general types of tests, even though within each general type there are different subgroups. \\xa0One of them is to actually test for the infection: is a person infected.\\xa0 The other — and I’ll get back to that in a second.\\xa0 The other is to test, as we just mentioned, if someone has been infected — usually someone who’s been infected, who has recovered.\\xa0 And as I’ll get to in a moment, that you could assume — although, we need to do some more work on that — that that person is actually protected against subsequent exposure and infection with an identical organism.\\n\\nSo what are some of the pluses and minuses of each?\\xa0 Because the pluses and minuses are really going to impact how we best use the test and how the test actually should be used.\\n\\nSo let’s take the test for whether or not you’re infected. The test of whether or not you’re infected is a test that, right now, is called a nucleic acid test.\\xa0 It’s not an easy test to do.\\xa0 There are some that are more rapid.\\xa0 There are some that have a high throughput.\\xa0 There are different groups within that.\\xa0 The good news about that is that it’s a sensitive and specific test, so that if you’re infected, you know you’re infected, so that — as I’ll get to in a moment — if you need to do something with that — get that person, put them in care, take care of them, get them out of circulation — that’s important.\\n\\nThe point about that that I think is often misunderstood is that if you get a test today — like I did today; it’s negative — if you get a test today, that does not mean that tomorrow or the next day or the next day or the next day, as you get exposed, perhaps from someone who may not even know they’re infected, that that means that I’m negative.\\xa0 Which means, if you take that to its extreme, in order to be really sure, you would almost have to test somebody either every day or every other day or every week or what it is to be absolutely certain.\\xa0 That’s an issue.\\n\\nNow, the problem that I talk about when I try and compare this to other situations, with what testing means to you — I, as I think most people know, have been involved in HIV/AIDS for 38 years, 39 years — from the very first week of HIV.\\xa0 So that’s what I do.\\xa0 If you get a test for HIV and you are negative, and you do not practice any risk behaviors, you can be guaranteed that next month, six months, one year from now, you will be negative if you don’t have a risk behavior.\\xa0 So there’s a big difference there about what testing actually means.\\n\\nSo the point I think you’re getting is that, although there is clearly a place for needing to test somebody for a given reason, a test means you’re negative now.\\n\\nNow, the other test is an antibody test — a test that tells you, in fact, that you’ve been infected.\\xa0 That’s really good.\\xa0 You’re going to hear about that — a bit about that from my colleagues in a moment.\\xa0 Because that will give you a broad view of two things: one, what the penetrance of the infection had been; and number two, you can make an assumption — though we still need to prove that.\\xa0 I mean, we are assuming that if you’re infected and you have antibody, you’re protected.\\xa0 And I think that’s a reasonable assumption, based on our experience with other viruses.\\n\\nBut what we want to make sure that we know, and these are some of the challenges:\\xa0What is the titer that is protective?\\xa0 How long is the protection?\\xa0 Is it one month?\\xa0 Is it three months?\\xa0 Is it six months?\\xa0 It’s a year?\\xa0 So we need to be humble and modest that we don’t know everything about it, but it really is an important test.\\n\\nThe other thing is the difference between testing and monitoring out there — what’s out there.\\xa0 The difference between what we really need it for, for phase one, is to be able to identify, isolate, contact trace.\\xa0 A very important part of when you’re putting — pulling back gradually and slowly on the mitigation, and you have people who might be infected — you want to know they’re infected; you want to put them in care.\\xa0 That is something that we absolutely need to do.\\n\\nBut there are other ways we — I want to make sure people understand that — not to underestimate the importance of testing.\\xa0 Testing is a part, an important part, of a multifaceted way that we are going to control and ultimately end this outbreak.\\n\\nSo please don’t anyone interpret it that I’m downplaying testing, but the emphasis that we’ve been hearing is essentially, “testing is everything,” and it isn’t.\\xa0 It’s the kinds of things that we’ve been doing — the mitigation strategies — that are an important part of that.\\n\\nNow, just a couple of things before I hand it over to my colleagues.\\xa0 No doubt — no doubt that, early on, we had a problem.\\xa0 I had publicly said that we had a problem early on.\\xa0 There was a problem that had to be corrected, and it was corrected.\\xa0 It was a problem that was a technical problem from within that was corrected.\\xa0 And it was an issue of embracing — the way we have now, and should have — the private sector, who clearly has the capability of making and providing tests at the level that we will need them for any of the things that I’ve just spoken about.\\n\\nSo, having said that, right now, I totally understand — and I am not alone; my colleagues understand — that although we say there are X number of tests out there — and you’re going to hear from Admiral Giroir about that — the fact is there have been and still are situations that are correctable, and will be corrected, and some of which have been corrected.\\n\\nI know — I get on the phone a lot with my colleagues, because, believe it or not, some long time ago, I was where they are in the hospitals, in the emergency room, looking at very sick individuals that you need to take care of.\\xa0 And I know what it means when someone tells you, “Hey, you have what you need,” and you look around and you say, “Well, maybe you think I have what I need, but I don’t really have what I need.”\\xa0 So we have to figure out: How do we close that gap?\\n\\nAnd there are a lot of things that I think we’ve learned, and that we are correcting and going to correct.\\xa0 Namely, you have a situation where tests are needed and appropriate.\\xa0 And either people have found there’s no tests or there’s no reagents or there’s no swabs — or a person needed a test and were told that there was a restriction; they couldn’t get a test.\\xa0 These are all the things that I’m telling — you already know because you’ve heard them.\\xa0 So right now — or there’s a delay of five to seven days.\\xa0 And what does that mean if you want to do — if you want to get somebody out of circulation?\\n\\nWe understand that that existed, but upon careful examination, what you are going to hear: that many of those have been already corrected and other of those will be corrected.\\xa0 Because what I think people don’t appreciate, through no fault of their own, is that there’s — that there are two issues: There’s supply and demand.\\xa0 And if you have a supply that can meet the demand, but the supply is not connected to the demand, then supply/demand falls apart.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by that?\\xa0 I mean there is an existing capacity that we have that, for one reason or other, maybe has not been fully communicated as to the availability of that existing capacity.\\xa0 And you’re going to hear about that now.\\xa0 There’s production capacity that gets better and better and better.\\xa0 And that’s what we’re talking about, because for what we need now, we believe that, with better communications, we’ll be able to make that happen.\\n\\nSo I know there’s going to be a lot of questions about that.\\xa0 I didn’t want to go on too long, but let me just finish by saying, given what I’ve just said and what I believe what you’re going to hear, that, for what we need in the first phase — if these things are done correctly, what I believe they can — we will have and there will be enough tests to allow us to take this country safely through phase one.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Tony.\\n\\nDr. Redfield.\\n\\nDR. REDFIELD:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 I want to make a few comments here.\\xa0 First, I want to talk a little bit about CDC has developed multiple systems to monitor disease outbreaks.\\xa0 I think many of you are familiar, for example, how we monitor for foodborne illness or how we monitor for antibiotic resistance in hospitals.\\xa0 But we’ve also developed a system to monitor for upper respiratory tract disease.\\xa0 If I can get the first slide there.\\n\\nThis is an example — because when we talk about what we know about this current pandemic, the reality is we know a lot because we’ve developed these monitoring systems.\\n\\nUp on the slide is a system that we’ve developed initially for flu.\\xa0 And what it does, as you can see, there’s multiple different flu seasons, and they track them over the course of a year.\\n\\nI want you to look at the red line.\\xa0 And that happens to be this year’s respiratory season.\\xa0 And you see there’s a peak there up over the 50-52 week.\\xa0 And that peak was when we actually had a peak of Influenza B.\\n\\nThis year was a little different because after that viral syndrome came down — and you can see it — that actually we had another peak.\\xa0 And that’s when Influenza A was active through our country.\\xa0 And you can see Influenza A started to drop.\\xa0 But then you saw a third peak.\\xa0 That peak was — here, we’re were looking at the coronavirus-19.\\n\\nSo we have systems, all the way down to the county level, that we can see where there’s respiratory tract illness.\\xa0 And so it’s not just — just taking a test.\\xa0 It’s monitoring these systems that have been developed over the last — over decades.\\xa0 And we have multiple ones.\\n\\nWe have another one — this — that is monitored in emergency rooms, looking at syndrome diagnosis.\\xa0 And they show the same thing.\\xa0 So we’re well equipped to monitor — to see when respiratory tract viral disease will come.\\xa0 And it becomes a very good surrogate for when you can begin to understand that we need to start looking more at ideologically about what’s going on.\\n\\nYou can see now, in week 15, we’re really coming down to the baseline background, in terms of our flu surveillance system, from the overall coronavirus situation right now.\\n\\nThe second thing I wanted to say is that CDC continues to enhance the state’s public health capacity to accelerate their ability — as Tony talked about, and it’s critical as we open America again — to diagnose individuals that present with influenza-like illness or coronavirus-like illness, to diagnose them, to be able to isolate them, and to be able to contact trace around them, and then diagnose the contacts.\\xa0 And those that are coronavirus-positive, to go back and do their contacts.\\n\\nThis is the traditional public health approach, which was started in this outbreak in January, in February, and was quite successful.\\xa0 And as I mentioned before, through February 27th, this country only had 14 cases.\\xa0 We did that isolation and that contact tracing, and it was very successful.\\xa0 But then, when the virus more exploded — got beyond the public health capacity.\\n\\nBut right now, CDC is enhancing that public health capacity.\\xa0 And if I can get the second slide, I want to show you that — this is just showing, as we sit here today, that CDC has embedded, in these health departments and all of these state — states across this country, more than 500 individuals.\\xa0 We also have an additional almost 100 individuals that are working on more than 20 coronavirus outbreaks that are going through all these states.\\n\\nAnd finally, at the direction of the President, we’ve been asked to further enhance this deployment in each of the states, as the Vice President said, so that there’s additional public health personnel to help accelerate the state’s ability to basically move forward aggressively.\\xa0 And we assist them so they can operationalize the President’s Guidelines To Open Up America Again.\\n\\nSo I just wanted to make those points for you today.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Great job.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nDr. Birx.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President, and thank you, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield, for all of that clarity.\\n\\nIf we can have the next slide, I’m going to go back to what Dr. Fauci was talking about just to emphasize those points about the two types of tests and I’m going to talk about a third one.\\n\\nSo first, we all know about sampling in the front of your nose.\\xa0 To all of the labs out there and to the providers, you don’t have to use the nasal pharyngeal swab anymore; you can do front-of-nose sampling.\\xa0 And again, as Dr. Fauci talked about, is that is sampling for the virus itself that replicates in your nose and, as we know, throughout some of the respiratory tissues.\\n\\nThe second test is, of course, then your immune response to that infection that’s in your nose.\\xa0 And so, that’s the antibody test.\\xa0 And so those are the two tests we want to talk about.\\n\\nBut I want to come back to something that both Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield said and we covered yesterday: Testing is a part of the exquisite monitoring that needs to occur in partnership with CDC and state and local governments, utilizing the surveillance systems that are available — what we just talked about: the flu surveillance system, because we no longer have flu, and the syndromic respiratory system.\\xa0 That is across the United States, and you can see it’s going back to baseline so that we’ll be able to see, at the community level, any deviation from that baseline.\\n\\nIn addition, what we talked about yesterday was adding that asymptomatic component.\\xa0 Because I think you’ll see, as more and more articles come out for surveillance that other — and monitoring that other states have done, higher and higher antibody in multiple individuals who don’t remember having a sickness.\\xa0 And that will give us an idea — that’s our asymptomatic monitoring in these sentinel monitoring sites.\\xa0 And what we talked about yesterday — we talked about nursing homes, we talked about indigenous people, and we talked about vulnerable people in the inner city, really ensuring that something that is so small, that can’t even be seen on the surveillance monitoring, will be able to be seen in the asymptomatic.\\n\\nAnd so those are the two tests that we have: one available now, two that have been approved — or three, by the FDA.\\n\\nI want to just leave you with my last concept on the antibody tests.\\xa0 Antibody tests have different specificity and sensitivities.\\xa0 The FDA, we’ve made that — the FDA has been very cautious about the antibody tests because I see — I know you see reports every day of countries that have ordered the antibody test and found that they were 50, 60, 70 percent faulty.\\xa0 So we’re taking that very seriously because you never want to tell someone that they have an antibody and potential immunity when they don’t.\\xa0 And so those tests perform better when there’s a high prevalence or a high incidence of disease.\\n\\nSo we want to work with mayors around the United States, as those antibody tests become available, to really see what it is in first responders and healthcare workers in the highest prevalence states, so that we can know about the quality and the real-life, real-field experience of those assays.\\xa0 Because things can look very good in the lab, and then when you take them into the field, sometimes they’re not as good.\\xa0 I’ve learned this lesson repeatedly in working around the globe.\\n\\nThe next slide.\\n\\nSo this is what we have asked commercial and diagnostic companies to be working on, because when you talk about multi-millions’ worth of tests, the way we do this in the United States today for strep, for influenza, and for malaria, is we test for the antigen.\\xa0 Now, we don’t know, right now, if you shed antigen in the front of your nose.\\xa0 And so that is the question that scientists and companies are working on right now.\\xa0 Because that becomes a simpler test.\\n\\nNow, the flu test — I think many of you will look it up tonight — you will see that outside of the flu season, because of the specificity of the test, it doesn’t work so well.\\xa0 So these are tests we’re working on today that would be like a screening test, because if you’re positive on it, it’s a good test, but it may miss that you actually have the flu.\\xa0 So then you would move into the — what we call the “nucleic acid test.”\\n\\nSo we’re trying to build an algorithm of tests that bring the full talent of the science of the United States into the reality of the clinic.\\xa0 And so, bench to clinic.\\xa0 And so this is what we’re working on for the future.\\n\\nNext slide.\\n\\nSo as I promised both the senators and the governors, this is the United States’ current platform capacity, designated as high and low throughput.\\xa0 And what do I mean by that?\\xa0 There’s — we’ve talked about the high-throughput platforms of Roche and Abbott and others.\\xa0 And then we’ve talked about the gene expert and other machines that may be moderate to lower throughput.\\n\\nI want you to see how it’s distributed through the United States.\\xa0 So these are the current testing platforms available today throughout the United States for COVID-19.\\xa0 And as you heard from Dr. Fauci, everything has to be working, from the swab, to the transport media, to the laboratory, to really get those tests run and the results back to the client.\\n\\nThe next slide.\\n\\nSo then we’ve looked at all of the testing capacity from those platforms, and this gives you an idea of what that capacity is.\\xa0 The darkest red — you can see, like, in Texas and New York, those are — those are states that have lots of different platforms, as you saw on the prior slide, and the ability, if you just add up the platforms and the potential for test, of over a million tests per month.\\n\\nAnd so this is what we’re working with each of those states on unlocking that full potential.\\xa0 And how are we doing that?\\xa0 Well, we’re call- — we’re calling on the American Society of Microbiologists.\\xa0 They have — they work closely with 300 lab directors around this — around the country; we talked with them this morning.\\xa0 And the Walter Reed team who developed the entire HIV testing program for the military 35 years ago.\\n\\nI’ve called them back into service and they’re calling lab by lab to find out what are the technical difficulties to bring up all the platforms that exist in your lab.\\xa0 Is it swabs?\\xa0 Is it transport media?\\xa0 Is it extraction?\\xa0 And I just really want to thank them.\\xa0 They’ve already worked through over 70-plus of those laboratories to really understand.\\xa0 And the American Society of Microbiologists and the academic societies of the laboratories are working together to ensure that all of this potential can be unlocked.\\n\\nNext slide, please.\\n\\nWe talked a little bit yesterday about New Orleans, and we — and the President talked about how many tests New Orleans has done during its outbreak, which you can see now is waning.\\xa0 They’ve done, throughout the last month, 27 tests per 1,000 New Orleans and Louisianians.\\xa0 So 27 per thousand.\\xa0 So that is a good mark, and that’s what — Italy has done about 20 per thousand.\\n\\nSo in evaluating an outbreak — and really to get control of this outbreak — they did about 27 tests per thousand.\\xa0 So using that as a measure — next slide — we then looked across all the states of the United States of America, and looked for states that had 30 or more — ability to do 30 or more tests per thousand of their inhabitants in each state.\\xa0 And you can see that, across the country, except for Oregon and Maine and —\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Montana.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Montana.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 (Laughs.)\\xa0 Montana.\\xa0 I worked overseas way too long.\\xa0 Thank you all.\\xa0\\xa0 So those are the three states that we’re working on building capacity in.\\xa0 So this is just to give you a perspective of how seriously we’re taking the testing issue.\\n\\nAs we’ve described, we’ve measured every single platform and every single state.\\xa0 We know exactly where they are, by geography, by address, by zip code, what their capacity is, what their cumulative capacity is, what their roadblocks are on non-ability to run all their full capacity.\\xa0 And we’re addressing those because each one of those is different and you have to address each of them one by one with the governors, with the state and local labs, and with all of the hospitals.\\n\\nI have not come across one laboratory or one laboratory director or one society that doesn’t want to contribute to solving this issue of testing and ensuring that this testing is available for everyone.\\n\\nThere is a strong — just as all the Americans have social distanced, and behind everyone — we don’t often talk about the laboratories; we’ll talk about the nurses and doctors on the front line — behind all of them are the laboratory technicians and laboratory directors who are coming in every day and putting things together to ensure that every single person that needs to be diagnosed is diagnosed.\\n\\nAnd hopefully you can see from these labs — I mean these slides that, really, there is capacity out there.\\xa0 It is our job, working with the states and having the state in the leadership role, and the laboratory directors in the leadership role to provide support to ensure that all the potential for testing in the United States is brought to bear.\\n\\nI just want to end with — these are nucleic acid tests.\\xa0 There will never be the ability on a nucleic acid test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school, but there might be with the antigen test.\\xa0 And so that’s why there’s a role for nucleic acid test, there’s a role for antibody tests, and there’s a role for the future development of these other key tests to bring the full ability to the United States.\\n\\nAnd so, when we finish this, we’ll be talking to all Americans because there’s other tests that other Americans should have.\\xa0 And I think this has really brought to light the importance of diagnosis.\\xa0 And we’ll talk to you further about hepatitis C and TB and other things that we can do to assure every American is healthy because I think this has really raised the awareness among all Americans about how you do test for different kinds and different parts of your disease state and what is long-lasting immunity, and what may be long-lasting immunity, and what is a nucleic acid test and what an antigen test is.\\n\\nAnd with that, Admiral Giroir.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Great.\\xa0 And let me amplify one point, as the Admiral steps forward, to conclude remarks about our approach and the efforts we put underway.\\n\\nGovernors across the country have been working very closely with us to roll out the level of testing that we have today.\\xa0 And all the information we presented to you is going to be reviewed in the days ahead and with all of our governors.\\xa0 Our objective is to connect every one of America’s governors and state health officials and to all of the labs that are currently able to do coronavirus.\\n\\nAnd — but Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci have both described, we believe today that we have the capacity in the United States to do a sufficient amount of testing for states to move into phase one at the time and manner that they deem to be appropriate.\\n\\nAnd with that, I’ll allow Admiral Giroir to complete our briefing on testing.\\xa0 And we expect the President to return.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President, and thank you to all my really great colleagues.\\n\\nCan I have the — my next slide?\\n\\nSo I wanted to start by where we are today and just to visit where we’ve come in such a short period of time.\\xa0 As everyone on the stage has said before, our testing right now is well over 3.78 million tests that have been completed.\\xa0 And if you are impressed by bar graphs, that’s over 1.2 million tests reported just in the last week.\\n\\nAmbassador Birx talked to me a little earlier, and she said, “You know, we only do about 2 million molecular tests a year for HIV” — something that’s been done for — developed for 35 years.\\xa0 We’re now doing twice that number of tests in a month for a disease that has never been known before, that there’s never been a test developed before.\\xa0 And that’s sort of where we are and where we’ve ramped up.\\n\\nI also want to give you a little idea — the lighter blue or lighter gray is our ID NOW tests.\\xa0 So we talk about them a lot because they are a point-of-care test that can be between 5 and 15 minutes.\\xa0 And they have a very specific role, but they’re not for everybody.\\xa0 If you’ve got to screen a few thousand people, four tests an hour doesn’t get you there on a machine; you have to use some of the larger, higher-throughput items.\\xa0 But they have a very important role. \\xa0And, again, coming into the market at 50,000 per day is really an important adjunct to us.\\n\\nShe talked about the GeneXpert from Cepheid.\\xa0 Very important.\\xa0 We don’t talk about that very much, but it is one of the backbone mobile point-of-care — not as easy to do, per se, as the Abbott — but it is a point-of-care test that really carries tuberculosis screening all through Africa.\\xa0 There are these machines — you saw that on her slide — every one of the 50 states has this in over 600 sites, and they’ve done over 700,000 tests just on that relatively low throughput, but very important platform.\\n\\nNext slide, please.\\n\\nI wanted to give you an idea of, sort of, how the tests are distributed and how they’re changing over time.\\xa0 On the left are the state public health laboratories.\\xa0 And although their numbers are relatively small — about 350,000 — the state public health laboratories are absolutely critical.\\xa0 They’re — they’re an absolutely critical core component of our testing.\\xa0 Not only were they there early and first, but they also do things like support outbreak investigations in nursing homes or investigations in certain plants that have close proximity with everyone because of their work environments.\\xa0 They also do testing on many people who do not have the opportunity to be tested elsewhere.\\xa0 And they are performing outstandingly well.\\n\\nACLA — I know we hate acronyms, but the American Clinical Laboratory Association — this is America’s commercial industrial backbone that we’re standing behind the President and the Vice President.\\xa0 And when I was there a few weeks ago in the Rose Garden — this is the LabCorp, the Quest, the BioReference Laboratory, Mayo, Sonic, and ARUP.\\xa0 And you’ll see they’ve done almost 2.3 million tests.\\xa0 This is the very large, high-throughput machines that Dr. Birx talks about.\\n\\nAnd I want to be clear about — about this group, is that it doesn’t matter where you are.\\xa0 I just took one of the largest labs, and I said, “Map out for me where you are, within 10 miles of where you are, every site in the country.”\\xa0 And when you do that, within 10 miles of a site of one of these, 93 percent of the U.S. population is covered.\\n\\nThese are truly national reference labs that cover almost everybody within the United States.\\xa0 So if you cannot get a test at your hospital, the chances are overwhelming that you could send this to these labs that are fully caught up now.\\xa0 They have no backlog of tests.\\xa0 They’ve ramped up their production, so their turnaround time is about 48 hours — because you may need to transport it from the middle of America, out to a lab, and result that.\\xa0 But that’s really very, very, very good.\\n\\nThe American Hospital Association and also academic labs — as the Vice President and the President have said, as more and more labs come online, they’re increasing the amount of testing that are done just at the hospitals or at academic medical centers — now almost at 600,000 tests.\\n\\nAnd again, matching the other slide, I had the Abbott point-of-care tests — just to give you a distribution — and that point-of-care test is being used, very importantly, in very select populations where a point-of-care test is really needed.\\xa0 That could be in some hospitals, where someone needs to know exactly if a person is positive or not to go on a clinical trial, or in a nursing home investigation, or sometimes to get people screened to go back into the work environment.\\n\\nMost people don’t need a point-of-care test.\\xa0 In fact, a point-of-care test does not — cannot replace the millions of tests that are here on the other slide.\\n\\nNext slide.\\n\\nI don’t know how interested you are in swabs.\\xa0 I did not know a whole lot of swabs before a few weeks ago.\\xa0 But there’s two points I want to make with these slides — is, yes, there have been constraining elements, and they’re constrained for a couple reasons.\\xa0 Number one, because this is an unprecedented scale-up of this type of very sophisticated molecular tests that has never put a demand on the system like we have.\\xa0 When we started out a few weeks ago, there’s very specific, one type of swab; only get it one place in the U.S., one place in Italy.\\xa0 And we were stuck with that for a while because it’s not just the quantity, it’s the quality.\\n\\nWhat I don’t want to do is put a lot of things in the system to make people believe that this is a good test, when it hasn’t been validated by the FDA, to say that a positive is a positive and a negative is a negative.\\xa0 But over the past weeks, both the scientific community, the Gates Foundation, academic medical centers, the FDA, have really opened up our ability to not stick that all the way back in your nasal pharynx, but do the anterior nose, and to greatly broaden the amount of swab types that are available.\\n\\nSo we are really at a point, right now, that over the next — by the end of April, will put another 5 million swabs, in addition to everything that’s out there now, and, by the end of May, over 12 million new swabs in the system — more than enough to obtain the capacity that we need.\\n\\nNext slide.\\n\\nFor these molecular tests, you take a swab and you stick it in a test tube, and that test tube has to have a specific kind of liquid in it.\\xa0 And when we started, it was viral transport media — a very special kind of media.\\xa0 The CDC has a “make your own recipe.”\\xa0 If you’re interested in cooking, you could probably do that, but it has a lot of ingredients that go in there, but still very limiting.\\n\\nWe’ve worked with many, many different laboratories.\\xa0 We’ve worked with the FDA.\\xa0 So now, PBS, phosphate-buffered saline — a, kind of, just laboratory-grade saltwater — can be used for this.\\xa0 This greatly opens the ability to expand the test to support all the capability that Dr. Birx talks about.\\n\\nAnd again, by the end of April, we will have put well over 5 million new tubes of either viral transport media or saline into the system.\\n\\nI am going to get to a conclusion here, but this was going to be more of a technical briefing.\\n\\nNext slide.\\n\\nSo let’s talk about the fact that the science tells us that we have and will continue to have enough tests to safely go into phase one.\\xa0 So let me be very granular about this: We’ve already heard that it is beyond the possibility to test everyone in this country every day.\\xa0 It’s — it’s just not possible.\\xa0 But it’s also a bad strategy because testing a person now just means they’re negative now.\\xa0 Dr. Fauci could be positive tomorrow, because it’s brewing in his system right now and we don’t know it, or that he contacts that.\\xa0 That’s not the way we go about things.\\n\\nThe way we go about things, as Dr. Redfield said, just — just think of the weather radar, okay?\\xa0 If the weather radar is clear, you’re not going to have a thunderstorm or a tornado.\\xa0 When something pops up, that’s when you’ve got to go to where the action is or know that your warning system is up.\\xa0 So, sort of, think of that in the background, and I’ll go specifically about that.\\xa0 So that’s monitoring.\\n\\nLet me talk about how much testing we need, just for overall testing.\\xa0 I’m just going to give you a number; I’m not saying that this is the number that’s there.\\xa0 But let’s just take a number that we are going to enter phase one when there are 200,000 new cases per month in the United States.\\xa0 Don’t get hung up on that — it’s going to be much less than that — but let’s just say 200,000 cases.\\xa0 So, how many tests do we need?\\n\\nWell, we need to test those 200,000 people to make the diagnosis, right?\\xa0 Everybody nod your head about that.\\xa0 We have to do that.\\xa0 Now, what’s a safe number over that?\\xa0 You know, if everybody I test has the disease, I’m not testing enough, right? But if I test 100 people to have 1 person with the disease, that’s probably over-testing.\\n\\nSo we kind of assume that a safe number that really gives us a good idea is if about 1 out of 10 people are positive, then we know we’re over-sampling the population enough that we’re getting all the positives.\\xa0 So if there’s 200,000 cases, I need about 2 million tests.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nNow, to go to Dr. Redfield’s point, each one of those that are positive have contacts that need to be traced.\\xa0 And on average, the CDC tells me that for every positive, there are about five contacts that really need to be traced.\\xa0 So let’s assume that those 200,000 people have five contacts.\\xa0 So now we have an extra million tests.\\n\\nSo 2 million tests out there to detect the 200,000 cases, an extra million out there to trace those contacts.\\xa0 So we’re up to about 3 million cases.\\xa0 If you want to put a fudge factor — say there’s 4 million tests, okay?\\n\\nThose are generally done at the main hospital labs, the commercial labs, state and regional labs.\\xa0 All this can be done — as well as some of the labs talked about by Dr. Birx.\\n\\nNext slide.\\n\\nThe second group of testing fits exactly perfectly with the influenza-like surveillance system that Dr. Redfield talked about.\\xa0 This is the monitoring.\\xa0 This is, sort of, the radar — the weather radar that it would be out there — that we’re not testing people who are symptomatic.\\xa0 We want to do testing on people who are asymptomatic because you can have asymptomatic carriage.\\xa0 You know, you could have this virus and shed it, and not have symptoms or only mild symptoms.\\n\\nSo what is the strategy here?\\xa0 The strategy here — this is an unprecedented strategy, okay?\\xa0 This is — this is really unprecedented.\\xa0 But we’re going to do, prob- — between three- and five hundred tests per week in the most vulnerable populations that we know that the virus could circulate.\\n\\nAnd what are they?\\xa0 Number one, nursing home and long-term care facilities.\\xa0 We know that from the history of this — of this virus, that that can circulate and be devastating.\\xa0 And it could circulate even in a way that you don’t have symptoms.\\xa0 So we’re going to survey, in a very controlled way, driven by the CDC, supervised by the CDC, surveys over — we may not get to everyone, but surveying in the areas to cover, in a selective way, the 15,000 or so nursing homes.\\n\\nSecondly, we want to work in vulnerable members in cities. And this is — the way we think about that is community health centers.\\xa0 I’m a huge fan of community health centers that are led by HRSA.\\xa0 There are there are about 30,000 community health center sites.\\xa0 They take care of 30 million people — children, adults, elderly.\\xa0 They care for about one third of Americans below the poverty level.\\xa0 They are arrayed to take care of our most vulnerable populations.\\xa0 So we want to survey asymptomatic people in those community health centers.\\n\\nWe also want to do in some of our indigenous population. And you know, very early, I was out here bringing machines to the Indian Health Service.\\xa0 And, in fact, 1,800 members of the Public Health Service provide care to the Indian Health Service, and their Director and Chief Medical Officer are both admirals in the Indian Health Service.\\n\\nPlus, workplace monitoring, particularly for workplace environments that may have very close contact or may have a high risk.\\xa0 And some of those could be agricultural facilities.\\n\\nSo let’s just total that up.\\xa0 We have 200,000 people who need a diagnosis.\\xa0 To make that diagnosis, we want to test 2 million.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 So that’s 2 million.\\xa0 We’re going to contact trace with a million.\\xa0 And let’s just throw you a fudge factor of about 25 percent on that; so that’s 4 million.\\xa0 And we have this background testing of about 400 — of about 400,000 per month.\\n\\nSo to safely do the testing, we need to be in the range of four and a half million — you followed my numbers,\\xa0because I want you to understand — per month that —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 For phase one.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 Pardon me?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 For phase one.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 For phase one.\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 For phase one.\\xa0 And I want to tell you that’s really how it adds up, and that’s where we are.\\xa0 Right now, we’re doing about 1 million to 1.2 million per week.\\xa0 We’re going to continue to push that farther and further, as we open up the laboratories and we’re able to open all the supplies that we need for that.\\n\\nAnd I think that’s where I would like to end.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Great.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 I’ll ask the team to step back up for questions.\\xa0 And we do anticipate, as his schedule permitted, that the President be returning momentarily.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, you talked about phase one.\\xa0 Will there be enough testing for phase two?\\xa0 Do you have to ramp up capacity for that?\\xa0 Or how do you deal with that?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s a very good question.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yeah, that’s a great question.\\xa0 And what we will be doing is monitoring how much we have to use in phase one to really help inform phase two, because it — the really unknown in this, to be completely transparent, is asymptomatic and asymptomatic spread.\\xa0 And so if we find that there is a lot of asymptomatic individuals that we find in this active monitoring, in what we — are very much concerned about the most vulnerable, then we will have to have increased testing to cover all of those — all of those sites.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And as we’ve made clear to the governors and other health officials, we’re going to continue to scale the testing.\\xa0 As the President has made clear, we want — we want governors and states to manage the testing operations in their states.\\xa0 We’ve given — we’ve given criteria.\\xa0 We’ve given guidance for how we think that would best operate.\\xa0 But we’re looking for the states, we’re looking for the governors to manage it.\\n\\nBut in the midst of that, all these great experts, working with all these great facilities, are going to continue to use that great American ingenuity to scale and increase the availability of testing for states to be able to implement as they move closer and closer to that day the President speaks of often, where we reopen America and put all of America back to work.\\n\\nMr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He did well?\\xa0 They all did well?\\xa0 I think.\\xa0 I’ll bet they did.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, thank you.\\xa0 Earlier today, Jay Inslee said that your tweets, encouraging liberation —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Who said this?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Jay Inslee said your tweets encouraging liberation in Michigan, Minnesota, Virginia, were fomenting rebellion.\\xa0 I’m wondering how that squares with the sober and methodical guidance that you issued yesterday in terms of —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think we do have a sobering guidance, but I think some things are too tough.\\xa0 And if you look at some of the states you just mentioned, it’s too tough.\\xa0 Not only relative to this, but what they’ve done in Virginia with respect to the Second Amendment is just a horrible thing.\\xa0 They did a horrible thing — the governor.\\xa0 And he’s a governor under a cloud, to start off with.\\n\\nSo when you see what he said about the Second Amendment, when you see what other states have done — no, I think I feel very comfortable.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Just to be clear, when you talk about these states — Michigan, Minnesota, Virginia — do you think that they should lift their stay-at-home orders?\\xa0 Or can you talk —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, but I think elements of what they’ve done are too much.\\xa0 I mean, it’s just too much.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Which elements?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You know the elements —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You cited Second Amendment.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — because I’ve already said.\\xa0 But certainly, Second Amendment, and Second Amendment having to do with the state of Virginia.\\xa0 What they’ve done in Virginia is just incredible.\\n\\nOkay.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, are you concerned, though, that people coming out in protest are going to spread COVID to other people?\\xa0 They’re congregating in ways that health experts have said they should not.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, these are people expressing their views.\\xa0 I see where they are and I see the way they’re working.\\xa0 They seem to be very responsible people to me, but it’s — you know, they’ve been treated a little bit rough.\\n\\nPlease, in the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thanks, Mr. President.\\xa0 I’m curious about some more of the dynamics we might see as the country begins reopening —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — as you put it, kind of like a “puzzle.”\\xa0 So as you’ve mentioned, we have states where we’re already seeing their curves begin to flatten, but then there are others, like Florida or more rural parts of the country, where they aren’t projected to peak for weeks or even months.\\n\\nSo can you talk a little bit about some of the difficulties that those later-peaking states might face; if they need to stay locked down for longer, even as other places around them are starting to open back up?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re seeing great numbers in almost every state.\\xa0 We’re seeing big drops.\\xa0 We’re really seeing — in terms of beds — the numbers we have to look at are the beds — the beds being occupied.\\xa0 People going — which is essentially people going in.\\xa0 That means that you have fewer people that are sick; fewer people that feel they have to go to a hospital.\\xa0 And those numbers are dropping really precipitously.\\xa0 So I think that — we’re just seeing a lot of good signs.\\n\\nNow, a place like New York, New Jersey, and certain parts of Louisiana — Louisiana has been incredible lately when you look at that drop.\\xa0 That drop has really been great.\\xa0 Michigan has had a hard time, but it’s — it’s starting to do well.\\n\\nSo, I just think — Illinois is another one.\\xa0 You know, you look at some of the numbers.\\xa0 But everyone is — is dropping, and they’re dropping rather quickly.\\xa0 We don’t have any hotspot that’s developed where, all of a sudden, you say, “Well…” — other than we did have a meatpacking plant or two where, incredibly, we had some — you saw the number was rather incredible.\\xa0 It took place in that plant.\\xa0 People would ask about that.\\xa0 I wonder who owned that company.\\xa0 That was a weird situation.\\xa0 But, generally speaking, it’s been very good.\\xa0 The numbers have been really improving greatly.\\n\\nPlease, in the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 U.S. intelligence is saying this week that the coronavirus likely came from a level 4 lab in Wuhan.\\xa0 There’s also another report that the NIH, under the Obama administration, in 2015 gave that lab $3.7 million in a grant.\\xa0 Why would the U.S. give a grant like that to China?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The Obama administration gave them a grant of $3.7 million?\\xa0 I’ve been hearing about that.\\xa0 And we’ve instructed that if any grants are going to that area — we’re looking at it, literally, about an hour ago, and also early in the morning.\\xa0 We will end that grant very quickly.\\n\\nBut it was granted quite a while ago.\\xa0 They were granted a substantial amount of money.\\xa0 We’re going to look at it and take a look.\\xa0 But I understand it was a number of years ago, right?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you are (inaudible)?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 When did you hear — when did you hear it was — the grant was made?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 2015.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 2015?\\xa0 Who was President then?\\xa0 I wonder.\\n\\nOkay.\\xa0 Yes, ma’am.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, we know negotiations are underway for the next round of funding for small businesses.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If tens of billions of dollars went in a matter of days the first time, will this next relief package be enough?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think it will certainly — it’s going to get us to a point that’s going to be rather beautiful.\\xa0\\xa0 We think that that will be the point — and it could be they want more, but maybe at a certain point, we’re going to stop.\\n\\nIt’s been a tremendous success.\\xa0 It’s been executed flawlessly.\\xa0 SBA has done a very good job.\\xa0 But the banks have done a great job, whether it was Bank of America or Wells Fargo.\\xa0 The community banks have been incredible.\\xa0 I think we had over 4,000 community banks.\\xa0 A lot of people didn’t know you had that many banks.\\xa0 But 4,000 community banks — they gave the money out.\\xa0 It’s so organized, and it’s been such a great program.\\n\\nAnd so, essentially we’re waiting for $250 billion; the Democrats are refusing to do it.\\xa0 This is money that essentially is going to the workers.\\xa0 It’s going to keep these companies whole — the restaurants and a lot of great companies.\\n\\nAnd it’s a small amount of money relative to what it represents, because it represents small businesses; it represents them staying in business.\\xa0 And, you know, when you look at it — people don’t know — small businesses represent approximately 50 percent of the power of our business enterprises.\\xa0 It’s not all the big, monster businesses that you read about every day.\\xa0 It’s all of these small businesses when added.\\n\\nIt’s something that should be approved by the Democrats.\\xa0 The Republicans want it badly, and the people want it very badly.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If I could just follow up on that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Nearly 10 percent of the loans that were given out were for $5 million, but some small-business owners say they can’t even get a loan for $100,000.\\xa0 Is that acceptable?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they would — no.\\xa0 They would get that, but they have to approve —\\xa0nobody knew it was going to be this successful.\\xa0 Don’t forget, when you say the money is gone it’s been a tremendous success as a program.\\n\\nPeople are — they really want it.\\xa0 And some people won’t be able to get their — keep their business open unless they get that money.\\xa0 It’s been a tremendous success.\\xa0 It’s been executed flawlessly.\\xa0 It’s been — I mean, with few exceptions, it’s really been good.\\xa0 And I think the Democrats are going to do it.\\n\\nLook, Nancy Pelosi — she’s away on vacation or something, and she should come back.\\xa0 She should come back and get this done.\\xa0 I don’t know why she’s not coming back.\\xa0 The fact is, she’s not doing her job, and there’s nothing unusual about that for her.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And Leader McCarthy said they’re now considering also adding more funding for hospitals included in this.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So they are thinking about hospitals, and hospitals —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Did you okay that compromise?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, hospitals are a good thing.\\xa0 Hospitals have been decimated by this.\\xa0 You know, they’ve given up their business — which is good, because they did the right thing — in order to take care of the COVID-19.\\n\\nAnd, no, hospitals — I’m with that all the way, if they want to add hospitals.\\xa0 We could also add it into phase four, if we do a phase four.\\xa0 Phase four would be, hopefully, infrastructure.\\n\\nA lot of people are talking about the best thing we could do for this country would be the payroll tax cut that I’ve been suggesting.\\xa0 A lot of Democrats like it, believe it or not.\\xa0 The payroll tax cut.\\n\\nAnd Art Laffer, who’s tremendous — he’s a tremendous — in fact, he recently got the Presidential Medal of Freedom — economist.\\xa0 He was with Ronald Reagan, and he’s been — he looks like he’s 25 years old, but I think he might be a little bit older than that.\\xa0 He looks so great.\\xa0 But Art Laffer said the single best thing you can do is the payroll tax cut.\\xa0 And I would just about agree with that, and I’d like to see that.\\n\\nI’m not sure that we’re going to get that, but I think that’s something that could be done.\\xa0 It’s simple.\\xa0 It’s really good for both the company that employs these people and for the people that are employed.\\xa0 So we’re going to see whether that happens or not.\\xa0 The payroll — I put it out there — the payroll tax cut would be a tremendous incentive for this country.\\n\\nSteve?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 China now says its coronavirus death toll in Wuhan is 50 percent higher.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yep.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It went up to about 4,000.\\xa0 Does that sound like a credible number to you?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, you know, when I listen to the press every night saying we have the most,\\xa0we don’t have the most in the world — deaths.\\xa0 The most in the world has to be China.\\xa0 It’s a massive country.\\xa0 It’s gone through a tremendous problem with this.\\xa0 A tremendous problem.\\xa0 And they must have the most.\\n\\nSo, today, I saw they announced that, essentially, they’re doubling up on the numbers.\\xa0 And that’s only in Wuhan; they’re not talking about outside of Wuhan.\\xa0 So it is what it is, Steve.\\xa0 It is what it is.\\xa0 What a sad — what a sad state of affairs.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The investigation into whether the virus escaped from this lab in Wuhan, how active is that?\\xa0 And when do expect to hear (inaudible)?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re looking at that.\\xa0 A lot of people are looking at it.\\xa0 It seems to make sense.\\xa0 They talk about a certain kind of bat, but that bat wasn’t in that area.\\xa0 If you can believe this, that’s what they’re down to now, is bats.\\xa0 But that bat is not in that area.\\xa0 That bat wasn’t sold at that wet zone.\\xa0 It wasn’t sold there.\\xa0 That bat is 40 miles away.\\xa0 So a lot of strange things are happening,\\xa0but there is a lot of investigation going on and we’re going to find out.\\n\\nAll I can say is, wherever it came from — it came from China — in whatever form, 184 countries now are suffering because of it.\\xa0 And it’s too bad, isn’t it?\\xa0 And it could have been solved very easily.\\xa0 When it was just starting, it could have been solved really very easily.\\n\\nYeah.\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 In the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 So, about the 80 million payments that have gone out —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — that you mentioned, you said that less than 1 percent have had snafus, but that could be 800,000 snafus.\\xa0 So we’ve also seen reports of —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I’m just saying it’s less than 1 percent, and the snafus are very minor.\\xa0 And they’re — and they were fixed.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 They’re not — you’re not talking about —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 Excuse me.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — massive numbers of dead people who have received checks —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, they were — they were — 80 million payments —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I mean, that could be — that could be tens of millions of people.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — went out over a period of a few days.\\xa0 And they caught certain mistakes that they made, but this is a tiny amount of mistakes.\\xa0 I can tell you mistakes were made in government where wrong countries were signed, okay?\\n\\nEighty million — this has been a tremendous success.\\xa0 And any mistake that was made, they’ve been caught.\\xa0 And it’s less than 1 percent.\\xa0 That’s a very good percentage.\\xa0 I can tell you, for government —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If how —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0 — I mean, how about — how about the Obama website?\\xa0 The Obamacare website, where they spent $5 billion on building a website that you could have built for — for peanuts.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If money went out to deceased people, is the government going to get that back?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Anything — anything that was sent out — it’s like, sometimes you send a check to somebody wrong.\\xa0 Sometimes people are listed, they die, and they get a check.\\xa0 That can happen.\\n\\nYou’re talking about — I guess the number is about 80 million people.\\xa0 Yeah, sure.\\xa0 We’ll get that back.\\xa0 Everything we’re going to get back.\\xa0 But it’s a tiny amount.\\xa0 They’ve done a fantastic job.\\xa0 This was done in a matter of a few days.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Your campaign said today that they are planning on resuming rallies before the election.\\xa0 Is there a timeline that you’re looking at?\\xa0 Would it be restricted to certain states?\\xa0 Have you thought about how that would work?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I hope we can do rallies.\\xa0 It’s great for the country.\\xa0 It’s great spirit.\\xa0 It’s great for a lot of things.\\xa0 It’s a — for me, it’s a tremendous way of getting the word out.\\n\\nIf you look at our success rate, we’ve had tremendous success.\\xa0 We win where we have rallies, including endorsements of candidates.\\xa0 Our success rate is, I think, unparalleled.\\xa0 There’s nothing like it.\\n\\nSo I certainly hope we can have rallies.\\xa0 We’ll find out.\\xa0 I don’t like the rallies where we’re sitting like you’re sitting.\\xa0 I mean, you got many reporters outside trying to get into this room.\\xa0 And I come in, I’m looking at this room and I see all this — it loses a lot of flavor.\\xa0 It loses, to me, a lot of flavor.\\n\\nBut I hope we’re going to have rallies.\\xa0 I think they’re going to be bigger than ever.\\n\\nI will say this: The rallies that we were having — until we had to stop, with regard to the problem that we had here — the rallies were bigger than they were — I think even substantially bigger.\\xa0 We’d go into the biggest arena and we’d turn away 20-, 30,000 people sometimes.\\xa0 In — in one case, I think they said, in New Jersey, we had 175,000 people show up for an arena that holds 9,000 people.\\xa0 And they showed up.\\xa0 And the reporters even reported that.\\xa0 That was almost shocking to me.\\n\\nBut I hope we can resume rallies because I think they’re an important part of politics, actually.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, under your reopening plan, some workers can go back to work in phase one, but schools cannot reopen until phase two.\\xa0 Many parents don’t have an option to work from home.\\xa0 So how can you get businesses back up and running as long as schools are closed?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think the businesses are going to.\\xa0 And I think now we’ve given the businesses a real jolt.\\xa0 A real positive jolt.\\xa0 They’re able to keep their employees.\\xa0 You know, without the employees — if the employees leave that area, if they leave — you know, who knows where they’re going — or if they get another job maybe someplace else, you’re not going to have the same business.\\n\\nSo we gave them money to hold their employees.\\xa0 They’re going to do that.\\xa0 We hope we can do $250 billion more.\\xa0 It’s — it’s absolutely so inexpensive compared to what it represents.\\xa0 And we hope that’s going to happen.\\n\\nBut I think — I really think — look, you see it with the stock market.\\xa0 The market was up seven- or eight hundred points today.\\xa0 And if you would have told me that we would have a virus, the likes of which this world has not seen since 1917 — which was the Spanish flu, where anywhere from 75- to 100 million people were killed — and then we’d have a stock market that’s not far below its all-time high — and it’s starting to get a little low.\\xa0 You know, then you had 1,000-point increase and a 1,200-point increase.\\n\\nSo now we have a stock market that’s at a point where it’s not very far away from where it was.\\xa0 And we’ve gone through a closed — literally, a closed country.\\n\\nRemember this also — I mean, we have had a closed economy.\\xa0 We had the best economy anywhere in the world by far.\\xa0 We had the best economy we’ve ever had.\\xa0 And remember this: The dollar is very strong.\\xa0 And dollars — strong dollars are overall very good, but it does cause problems.\\xa0 It’s harder to sell outside of the country, et cetera, et cetera.\\xa0 It’s a little harder for manufacturers.\\xa0 Sometimes it’s a lot harder.\\n\\nEverybody wants to invest in our country.\\xa0 Everybody wants — and, you know, we’re paying almost zero in interest.\\xa0 Like, in some cases, zero.\\xa0 We’ve never had that before.\\xa0 People want the safety of our country.\\xa0 But if you would have told me that a market was where it is today — and today we had almost, I guess, more than a 700-point increase, and we’re at a point which is, you know, it’s not what it was, but it’s not that far off — I would have told you that’s got to be an impossibility.\\xa0 The reason that is, is because there is a great pent-up demand.\\n\\nThis country is going to come back and it’s going to come back strong.\\xa0 We have to get rid of the virus.\\xa0 We’ve got to open up our country.\\xa0 We’re going to open it up in quadrants.\\xa0 We’re going to open it up in states.\\xa0 Some of the states should get together and they should work on their own borders and everything, because you don’t want to have people pouring through the border of a state that isn’t infected and you have people coming perhaps outside.\\n\\nThat’s one of the reasons I was asking Tony, two days ago, about masks.\\xa0 Well, why in Wyoming or Montana would they have to wear masks?\\xa0 Their numbers are very good.\\xa0 The reason is, if somebody comes from outside — you know, which is very severe.\\xa0 But it’s, again — and it’s going to be up to them.\\xa0 It’s a recommendation, but we’ll see.\\n\\nBut if you were to tell me how well we’re doing after we went through the worst event of its kind since 1917, it’s pretty amazing.\\n\\nA question?\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 About childcare, though: Millions of Americans aren’t sure how they can go back to work if schools are closed.\\xa0 Where — how can they have their kids taken care of?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The schools will be open too.\\xa0 Very soon.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is your government considering something, in addition to helping employees stay employed —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think it’s — yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — to help them take care of their kids?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s a good question.\\xa0 I think the schools are going to be open soon.\\xa0 I think a lot of governors are already talking about schools being opened.\\xa0 And we do have to take care of our seniors, because we’ve learned a lot about this disease.\\xa0 We’ve learned — call it a disease.\\xa0 We’ve learned a lot about this plague.\\xa0 And we have to take care of our seniors.\\xa0 We’re going to take care of a lot of people.\\n\\nBut I think the schools are going to be open sooner rather than later.\\xa0 And I understand and I’ve spoken — some governors are already talking about — thinking about getting the schools opened.\\xa0 I have a young boy who goes to school.\\xa0 I’d like to see him go to school.\\xa0 As good as home is, it’s very nice, but we’d like to see him go to school.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 I’d agree with that point.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 I would like to know about some of these areas that you would like to open up, some of these quadrants.\\xa0 You singled out Virginia, Michigan.\\xa0 They don’t have a decline in cases yet, yet you tweeted out today that you’d like to “liberate” them.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they’re going to have soon, but they’re very, very, very — what they’ve done is very powerful, in terms of — I think — you know, you can get the same result out of doing a little bit less.\\xa0 What they’ve done to some people is very unfair.\\n\\nIn Virginia, I’m going above and beyond what we’re talking about with this horrible plague.\\xa0 They want to take their guns away.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 They want to take their guns away.\\xa0 That’s the Second Amendment.\\xa0 That’s Virginia.\\xa0 You have a gov- — governor who really — I guess he should be under siege; he seems not to be.\\xa0 If he were a Republican, he’d be under siege.\\xa0 But he seems to have escaped something that was pretty bad, including what he said about birth, including what he said about many different things.\\n\\nBut he wants to take — if you take a look at what’s going on in Virginia, they want to take away Second Amendment rights.\\xa0 And that’s what they want to do.\\xa0 So when you talk about “liberate” or if you talk about a liberation, you could certainly look at Virginia as one.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 Anybody else?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Steve.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Which states are ready to reopen, in your mind, and how soon?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I don’t want to go — I want to leave — the governors make that decision.\\xa0 We’re watching very closely.\\xa0 If we see something happening bad that we think is wrong, we’re going to come down very strong on that.\\xa0 Very, very strong.\\n\\nThe federal government has a lot to say.\\xa0 We have — we have a lot to say — beyond what anyone understands.\\xa0 And we think — and I’ve gotten to know many of the governors, many Democrats too.\\xa0 It’s Republicans and — I knew the Republicans.\\xa0 I knew some of the Democrats, but I got to know a lot of them.\\xa0 I think it’s going to be in the hands of a lot of good people.\\xa0 I think a lot of good people are looking at this and they want to do what’s right, Steve.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And the Vice President is traveling soon, I think tomorrow to Colorado.\\xa0 When are you going to be in a position to travel again?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they’d rather not have me travel.\\xa0 I think I’ve been in the White House, I don’t know, for months.\\xa0 I don’t know what it is, but it’s for months — other than I did leave to — to say goodbye to our beautiful ship.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 The Comfort.\\xa0 The — as it left Virginia.\\xa0 When it got out of dry dock — it got out of maintenance very early.\\xa0 It was supposed to be there for four weeks; it was there for a few days, literally.\\xa0 We got it up to New York.\\n\\nI mean, they didn’t — they didn’t need it like — well, I wouldn’t say “we hoped.”\\xa0 I’m glad they didn’t need it.\\xa0 They didn’t need it; that was a good thing.\\xa0 They didn’t need the convention center — 2,500 beds or, depending on your definition, 2,900.\\xa0 We ultimately converted it to COVID — the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA.\\xa0 The job they did was incredible.\\n\\nBut that’s a sign that they’re making progress in New York.\\xa0 If you look at that, you know, we built it.\\xa0 It was ready.\\xa0 It’s there now.\\xa0 It’s ready.\\xa0 We converted it to COVID — it wasn’t supposed to be for that — at the request, frankly, our side.\\xa0 Then, ultimately, we converted it, but there is much less demand.\\xa0 That’s such a good thing.\\xa0 I mean, I’m not complaining about that.\\xa0 I think it’s a great — that means New York is making progress.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is it important to you that the Vice President is going tomorrow?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He’s going to — to Colorado?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The Air Force Academy.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think he’s going to the Air Force to make the commencement, right?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, I think it’s great.\\xa0 I think it’s great.\\xa0 If he’s going to make the commencement — I hear they’re going to have a very spread-out crowd.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They’re going to be — I will say, they are going to be, socially, very good.\\xa0 They’re going to be very far apart.\\xa0 That’ll be very interesting.\\xa0 I think I’m going to watch that one.\\xa0 No, they’re going to be — they’re going to have a good spread, a good distance apart.\\xa0 I spoke to Mike about it.\\n\\nNo, I think, making the commencement speech — I’m doing it at West Point, which I look forward to.\\xa0 I did it last year at Air Force, I did it at Annapolis, I did it at the Coast Guard Academy, and I’m doing it at West Point.\\xa0 And I assume they’re — they’ve got it, and I understand they’ll have distancing.\\xa0 They’ll have some big distance, and so it’ll be very different than it ever looked.\\n\\nDo I like the look?\\xa0 No, I don’t.\\xa0 And eventually, next year, they’ll have a commencement which will be like it’s been, like when people like this — our great Admiral, who has done such a great job.\\xa0 When he graduated from where he graduated — me too — we were nice and tight.\\xa0 And that’s going to happen again.\\n\\nI don’t want people to think that this going to be like this forever.\\xa0 But, for a period of time, we’re going to have to keep it that way.\\xa0 That includes baseball games and football games, and other things.\\xa0 But eventually, as this virus goes away, it’s going to be better and better.\\xa0 Director, it’s going to be better and better.\\xa0 And we’re going to get our lives back to the way they were.\\n\\nYou know, one thing that bothers me: A couple of restauranteurs called, and they said, I mean, “Sir, I barely made a living with 150 seats.\\xa0 Now, if I do what they want me to do, I’ll be down to 25 seats and I can’t.”\\xa0 I said, “Yeah, but you’re not going to be there forever.”\\xa0 And he didn’t really know that.\\xa0 He thought that they were going to take 150 seats, move it down to 25 to 50 seats, depending on the way he laid it out.\\xa0 I said, “Don’t worry about it.\\xa0 Eventually, you’re going to be back to the scene that you used to have, which was…”\\n\\nLook, I could tell you about — and I’m not going to do it, because I didn’t want to bring it up — but I could tell you about events that took place.\\xa0 And I said things like, “You’ll never do that again” or “You’ll never do this again” or — I don’t even want to mention the events.\\xa0 I don’t want to mention what you’re supposed to be doing because — and you know one of them was so horrible.\\n\\nI said, “A certain industry will be out of business — never happen again.”\\xa0 Two weeks later, it was like nothing ever happened.\\xa0 Hopefully, we get rid of this.\\xa0 We have tremendous talent up here and all over, including governors, including local governments, state governments.\\xa0 I look forward to the time, to me, when we can really normalize.\\xa0 But normalizing is being back to where we were.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, some of your allies are calling for China to be stripped as host of the 2022 Olympics.\\xa0 I’m wondering what you make of that?\\xa0 Is that something that you would consider or —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So I just made a deal with China where they’re going to put in $250 billion of product.\\xa0 They’re going to be — they’re going to be buying $250- — 50; from 40 to 50 — billion in farm.\\xa0 I want to see what’s happening with China.\\xa0 I want to see how they’re doing on it: Are they fulfilling the deal, the transaction?\\n\\nWe have a lot of discussions going on with China.\\xa0 Let me just put it this way: I’m not happy, okay?\\xa0 I’m not happy.\\xa0 And I spoke to them.\\xa0 And this could have been shut down a long time ago.\\xa0 They knew it.\\xa0 And we couldn’t get in.\\xa0 And, in all fairness, World Health couldn’t get in, and that’s why I wish they took a different stance.\\xa0 They took a very pathetic stance and a very weak stance.\\xa0 But they say they couldn’t get in.\\n\\nBut, ultimately, they got in; they got in much sooner than anybody, but they didn’t report what was happening.\\xa0 They didn’t report what was happening inside of China.\\xa0 No, I’m not happy with China.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I wanted to ask Dr. Fauci: Could you address these suggestions or concerns that this virus was somehow manmade, possibly came out of a laboratory in China?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Want to go?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You studied this virus.\\xa0 What are the prospects of that?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 There was a study recently that we can make available to you, where a group of highly qualified evolutionary virologists looked at the sequences there and the sequences in bats as they evolve.\\xa0 And the mutations that it took to get to the point where it is now is totally consistent with a jump of a species from an animal to a human.\\n\\nSo, I mean, the paper will be available — I don’t have the authors right now, but we can make that available to you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just one follow-up, sir, on the protest that you — that we’ve seen of people wanting the economies open.\\xa0 Does that concern you though, as a health expert, when you see folks congregate?\\xa0 And are you worried if that’s encouraged?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Well, I mean, I’m looking at it from a public health standpoint.\\xa0 I certainly could understand the frustration of people, but my main role in the task force is to make recommendations to protect the health and the safety of the American people.\\xa0 And I would hope that people understand that that’s the reason why we’re doing what we’re doing, and hopefully we’ll put an end to this.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And I will say this: I’m very, very satisfied with the decision we made, listening to experts, listening to my gut, the feeling of the Vice President, and really many others.\\xa0 When we put it all together, I’m very — look, if we didn’t do what we did at the time, we could have lost more than 2 million people.\\xa0 I really believe that.\\n\\nI could show you charts of other places that gave it a shot and they’re not doing well.\\xa0 And I would show it to you right now; I don’t want to embarrass anybody.\\xa0 But they gave that a shot.\\xa0 It’s an automatic.\\xa0 I mean, everybody would say, “Let’s do that” — until they sit down and start thinking.\\xa0 And we could have lost more than 2 million people.\\xa0 We could have lost more than 2 million.\\xa0 It could have been much more than that, by the way.\\xa0 We have one that says from 1.6 to 2.2, but it could have really been more than that.\\xa0 But I looked at one in particular — one country in particular that is using the herd mentality, and not working out very well.\\n\\nNow, with all of that being said, we have to get back to work.\\xa0 We’ve — we’ll be crossing lines very soon, in many cases.\\xa0 In some cases, we’re well on the way down.\\xa0 In other cases, we’re right at the top and heading down.\\xa0 We’re heading in the right direction.\\n\\nI saw some numbers from New Jersey, which was having a very tough time.\\xa0 It started — he’s — he’s doing a terrific job, the governor — Phil — Phil Murphy.\\xa0 Starting to get some really good signs.\\n\\nI looked at some of the New York numbers.\\xa0 They’re starting to get — they’ve been devastated, obviously, but some really good things are starting to happen.\\n\\nSo, if we would have done something different — first of all, it would have — it would not have been sustainable.\\xa0 You would have had people — they would have been furious at you and me and everybody up here.\\xa0 They — it would not have been sustainable.\\xa0 Because you look at some of the hospitals — as an example, a certain hospital right near where I grew up in Queens — and you had body bags all over the floor of that hospital.\\xa0 You know the one I’m talking about.\\xa0 All over the floor of the hospital.\\n\\nNow, multiply that times 12 or 15, because that’s the kind of numbers you’re talking about — 12 or 15.\\xa0 And it would not have been — it would not have been a lot — there would have been an insurrection.\\xa0 Nobody would have — nobody would have understood that.\\n\\nWhereas, right now, nobody can be blamed, and there is no blame.\\xa0 We’re all in a situation that was caused — that should have been solved long ago.\\xa0 It could have been solved probably very easily — look, it was a tough enemy — but probably very easily if a certain country did what they should have done.\\xa0 And we’re just starting to learn those facts.\\xa0 But what we did was the right thing.\\xa0 What we did was the right thing.\\n\\nWith that being said, we want to get back and we want to — we’re going to be opening up states.\\xa0 They’re being opened by very capable people.\\xa0 It’s also point of sale, as they say, in a different business.\\xa0 It’s the point — they’ll be able to look at that — you know, where the testing is taking place.\\xa0 We’re going to help them with the testing.\\xa0 We’ve developed some tremendous tests over the last little while.\\xa0 And we’re going to work with the states and we’re going to help them.\\xa0 But they know every inch of land in their states.\\n\\nI watched the governor of Arkansas, Asa.\\xa0 You saw that.\\xa0 He — I thought he was terrific.\\xa0 I watched the governor of Oklahoma over the weekend being interviewed.\\xa0 He was terrific.\\xa0 They’ve done it a little bit differently.\\xa0 And they’ve done it tight and they’ve done it strong, and they were very prepared, and they have more beds than they needed, and that’s a good thing.\\xa0 But I’ve seen some very, very good things.\\xa0 And I think you’re going to have some very positive events taking place over a very short period of time.\\n\\nAnd I think, with that, we’ll see you tomorrow.\\xa0 But really, this has been — this has been a situation where a lot of great people have been involved and a lot of great decisions have been made.\\n\\nThank you all very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nEND\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 8:06 P.M.

       "  'text': 'James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\\n\\n6:06 P.M. EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Our nation is engaged in a historic battle against the invisible enemy.\\xa0 To win this fight, we have undertaken the greatest national mobilization since World War Two.\\xa0 And that’s exactly what it’s been.\\n\\nWe’ve marshaled every instrument of American power, and we’ve unleashed our most potent weapon of all: the courage of the American people.\\n\\nThese have been trying times.\\xa0 A cruel virus from a distant land has unfairly claimed thousands of precious American lives.\\xa0 To every citizen who has lost a cherished loved one: Your pain is our pain.\\xa0 We mourn as one national family.\\xa0 Our country has come together.\\xa0 We draw solace from the faith that God has received, and the departed — He has taken the departed into his eternal and loving embrace.\\xa0 They will never be forgotten.\\n\\nOver the last weeks and months, millions of Americans have joined together in a shared national sacrifice to halt the spread of this horrible disease.\\xa0 The Army built field hospitals and sports arenas and convention centers.\\xa0 The Army Corps of Engineers is great.\\xa0 Over 20,000 beds in record time.\\n\\nThe Navy sailed hospital ships to our biggest cities.\\xa0 Lifesaving supplies and experimental medicines were rushed to the frontlines as we launched a rapid search for groundbreaking treatments and vaccines.\\n\\nWe built the most advanced and robust testing anywhere in the world, and we’ve done more testing than any country anywhere in the world.\\n\\nWe suspended dangerous foreign travel.\\xa0 We leveraged our industrial base to produce vast quantities of critical medical gear and enacted a historic 2-trillion-dollar relief package.\\n\\nThrough it all, we have seen the heroism of our doctors and nurses like never before — these are our warriors — the bravery of our truck drivers — such bravery — and food suppliers — such incredible bravery, and the determination and drive of our citizens.\\xa0 Through this unified national endeavor, we have made great progress.\\xa0 You could really say incredible progress.\\n\\nOur experts and scientists report that our strategy to slow the spread has saved hundreds of thousands of lives.\\xa0 Models predicted between 1.5 million and 2.2 million U.S. deaths — if there was no mitigation, it could have even been higher than that — and between 100,000 and 240,000 deaths with mitigation.\\xa0 It’s looking like we will come far under even these lowest numbers.\\n\\nThanks to our all-out military operation and the extraordinary devotion of our people, we believe we will experience far fewer deaths than even the optimistic projection.\\xa0 But there is no such thing as an optimistic projection on death.\\xa0 One person is too many.\\n\\nOur experts say the curve has flattened and the peak in new cases is behind us.\\xa0 Nationwide, more than 850 counties, or nearly 30 percent of our country, have reported no new cases in the last seven days.\\n\\nBecause of our early and aggressive action, we have avoided the tragedy of healthcare rationing and deadly shortfalls that have befallen many other nations — nations which, wherever possible, we are helping.\\xa0 In America, no person who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator.\\xa0 We’re making hundreds of thousands of ventilators.\\xa0 We’ve delivered thousands and thousands of ventilators to the states.\\n\\nAnd actually, it’s been an incredible operation.\\xa0 We started with very little and we ended with a lot.\\xa0 The United States has achieved a significant lower mortality rate than almost all other countries.\\n\\nBased on the latest data, our team of experts now agrees that we can begin the next front in our war, which we’re calling, “Opening Up America Again.”\\xa0 And that’s what we’re doing: We’re opening up our country.\\xa0 And we have to do that.\\xa0 America wants to be open, and Americans want to be open.\\n\\nAs I have said for some time now, a national shutdown is not a sustainable long-term solution.\\xa0 To preserve the health of our citizens, we must also preserve the health and functioning of our economy.\\xa0 Over the long haul, you can’t do one without the other.\\xa0 It cannot be done.\\xa0 To keep vital supply chains running, these chains have to be taken care of so delicately.\\xa0 They’re delicate.\\xa0 The balance is delicate.\\n\\nWe want to deliver food and medical supply.\\xa0 We must have a working economy.\\xa0 And we want to get it back very, very quickly, and that’s what’s going to happen.\\xa0 I believe it will boom.\\n\\nA prolonged lockdown combined with a forced economic depression would inflict an immense and wide-ranging toll on public health.\\xa0 This includes a sharp rise in drug abuse, alcohol abuse, suicide, heart disease, and many other dimensions of physical and mental wellbeing.\\xa0 Moreover, many patients have put needed medical care on hold, creating entirely new hazards for public health.\\n\\nOur country has suffered.\\xa0 The world has suffered.\\xa0 One hundred and eighty-four other countries have suffered.\\n\\nTherefore, my administration is issuing new federal guidelines that will allow governors to take a phased and deliberate approach to reopening their individual states.\\xa0 I’ve dealt with them now a long time, and we’ve had a great relationship — Democrat, Republican.\\xa0 The relationship has been good.\\xa0 This strategy is based on hard, verifiable data.\\n\\nI want to thank Dr. Birx for her incredible leadership in crafting these guidelines in consultation with scientists, experts, and medical professionals across government.\\xa0 Dr. Birx will explain the guidelines in more detail in a few moments.\\xa0 And Dr. Fauci has been absolutely terrific.\\xa0 We’ve all worked together, and we’ve worked together well.\\n\\nThey are interested in the health of our country.\\xa0 And we’re all interested in the viability and making us truly great again.\\xa0 We took the greatest economy in the history of the world, and we closed it in order to win this war.\\xa0 And we’re in the process of winning it now.\\n\\nOur approach outlines three phases in restoring our economic life.\\xa0 We are not opening all at once, but one careful step at a time.\\xa0 And some states will be able to open up sooner than others.\\xa0 Some states are not in the kind of trouble that others are in.\\n\\nNow that we have passed the peak in new cases, we’re starting our life again, we’re starting rejuvenation of our economy again, in a safe and structured and very responsible fashion.\\n\\nOur strategy will continue to protect senior citizens and other vulnerable populations while allowing military and other groups of incredibly talented people to go about their real business and the business that’s supposed to be hard at work at doing.\\xa0 And nobody does it better.\\xa0 Our military is the greatest anywhere in the world, and we’re so thankful for what they’ve done.\\n\\nHealthy Americans will now be able to return to work as conditions on the ground allow.\\xa0 Instead of a blanket shutdown, we will pursue a focus on sheltering the highest-risk individuals.\\xa0 So important.\\xa0 We’re establishing clear scientific, metric, and — benchmarks on testing, new case growth, and hospital capacity that must be met before advancing to each phase.\\xa0 And that’s each phase specifically in the reopening of our country.\\n\\nThis is a gradual process.\\xa0 As the caseload in a state continues to go down, restrictions can continue to be eased and come off.\\xa0 Throughout the process, citizens will continue to be called upon to use all of their weapons in this war: vigorous hygiene, teleworking when possible, staying at home if you feel sick, maintaining social distance, sanitizing commonly used surfaces, and being highly conscious of their surroundings.\\xa0 Those are our weapons, and they’re very powerful weapons indeed.\\n\\nGovernors will be empowered to tailor an approach that meets the diverse circumstances of their own states.\\xa0 Every state is very different.\\xa0 They’re all beautiful.\\xa0 We love them all.\\xa0 But they’re very, very different.\\xa0 If they need to remain closed, we will allow them to do that.\\xa0 And if they believe it is time to reopen, we will provide them the freedom and guidance to accomplish that task — and very, very quickly — depending on what they want to do.\\n\\nWe are also encouraging states to work together to harmonize their regional efforts.\\xa0 We’ll have numerous cases where states have worked and will be working very, very closely together.\\n\\nAs we reopen, we know that there will be continued hardships and challenges ahead.\\xa0 Our goal will be to quickly identify and address any outbreaks and put them out rapidly.\\xa0 If the virus returns in the fall, as some scientists think it may possibly, these guidelines will ensure that our country is up and running so that we can likewise put it out quickly.\\n\\nAt the heart of our strategy is the vital role of medical research, especially for therapies that will significantly improve outcomes for high-risk patients and reduce the need for urgent care.\\xa0 This will be tremendously valuable in allowing life to eventually return to normal.\\xa0 At least 35 clinical trials are already underway, including antiviral therapies, immune therapies, and blood therapies in the form of convalescent plasma.\\xa0 You’ve all heard about some of these events and some of these therapies.\\xa0 They’ve come a long way.\\xa0 What’s been done in the last four weeks is incredible.\\n\\nWe will also continue to expand our testing capacity.\\xa0 We have now completed more than 3.5 million tests — by far the most anywhere in the world.\\xa0 Areas of our country that have been hotspots have done much more testing, on a per capita basis, than South Korea.\\xa0 We’ve done more than South Korea — and South Korea has done a good job, but we’ve done more.\\n\\nWe will continue to work with governors to advise them on how to conduct both surveillance and diagnostic testing.\\xa0 We have now distributed over 600,000 Abbott ID NOW point-of-care diagnostic tests.\\xa0 These are tests that are done on site, and, within five minutes, you know the answer: positive or negative.\\n\\nIn recent days, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of tests performed by hospitals and academic institutions, with more than 120,000 tests recently reported in a single day — far more than any country in the world has ever been able to do.\\xa0 And our numbers are actually going up.\\n\\nAs these new and better testing solutions come online, we’re seeing this additional capacity reflected in the numbers.\\xa0 For this reason, the number of tests processed in commercial laboratories has dropped from approximately 100,000 to roughly 75,000 tests over the last week.\\xa0 The reason it dropped is because we have so many other tests and we don’t even have to go through the laboratories.\\xa0 But the laboratories have tremendous additional capacity, and states feel free to use that capacity.\\n\\nSome in the media falsely reported this as a bad thing, when, in fact, it is a great thing because it indicates that the states are moving to faster, more local testing solutions, including on-the-spot tests.\\n\\nSo this drop in the utilization of commercial laboratories is an affirmation that testing, which is at an all-time high, is growing at a historic rate.\\xa0 In other words, the laboratories are great, but now we have forms of testing that are much quicker, much better, and we don’t have to use the laboratories.\\xa0 But they’re there, and they have a great capacity to do the work.\\n\\nAs Dr. Birx has been advising our governors for weeks, we continue to have an excess testing capacity of 1 million tests per week available for use.\\xa0 And our capabilities are growing every single day, especially with the new tests that are coming onto the market rapidly.\\n\\nAs we begin a science-based reopening, we must be extra vigilant in blocking the foreign entry of the virus from abroad.\\xa0 Border control, travel restrictions, and other limitations on entry are more important than ever to keep the virus in check and allow Americans to get back to work.\\n\\nThe sacrifices our citizens have made in this time of crisis will be remembered, studied, honored, and praised for generations to come.\\xa0 We’re really all working together.\\xa0 Democrat, Republican, conservative, liberal — we’re all working together.\\xa0 This is not about parties; this is about our country.\\n\\nNow the American people are ready to rise to the occasion once again.\\xa0 They are ready to show the world once more that Americans can defeat any challenger.\\xa0 Together, we will rebuild this land that we love, we will reclaim the magnificent destiny that we share, and we will carry our nation forward to new heights of greatness and glory.\\n\\nI would now like to ask Vice President Mike Pence and Dr. Birx to further explain the new guidelines.\\xa0 I want to thank Dr. Birx.\\xa0 I want to thank Dr. Fauci.\\xa0 And I want to thank, really especially, a man who has devoted 24 hours a day to his task force and done such an incredible job — our great Vice President, Mike Pence.\\n\\nPlease, Mike.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 The members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force today joined the President to meet with a bipartisan group of members of the House and of the Senate to get their counsel on the development of what the President unveiled to America’s governors this afternoon.\\n\\nThe new guidelines for “Opening Up America Again” are a product of the best science and the best common sense that the President has marshaled on this team and from a broad range of advisors from all across the nation.\\n\\nFrom the moment President Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force, early on he made it clear that we have no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people.\\n\\nThe President launched a whole-of-government approach.\\xa0 And while we stand here, on this day, with more than 640,000 Americans having contracted the coronavirus — and our hearts go out to the families of the more than 31,000 Americans who lost their lives and those who continue to struggle with serious consequences of the coronavirus — the truth is that because of the decisive action that our President took early on, suspending travel from China and thereafter from portions of Europe and South Korea; screening passengers; because of the strong actions in partnership with every governor across America; because of the extraordinary efforts of America’s healthcare workers on the frontlines; and because of the cooperation of the American people and God’s grace, we are slowing the spread, we are flattening the curve, we have preserved the capacity of our healthcare system, and we’ve protected the most vulnerable.\\n\\nIn a word, because of the actions of this President, this administration, governors at every level, our healthcare workers, and our fellow Americans, we’ve saved lives.\\xa0 And every American should be comforted by that.\\n\\nAnd we can see it in the numbers, in the charts that I’ll present today.\\xa0 These three maps track influenza-like illness, which, in this instance, is mostly coronavirus across America.\\xa0 The first map reflects the total number of cases on the week ending March the 28th.\\xa0 The next map reflects our data about the total number of cases on the week ending April 4.\\xa0 And we stand here today with the final map reflecting the total number of cases across America, as of April the 11th.\\n\\nWith these trends underway, President Trump tasked the White House Coronavirus Task Force to develop new guidelines for “Opening Up America Again.”\\xa0 Those guidelines were presented today — first, to our nation’s governors.\\xa0 And it is our intention, at the President’s direction, to provide these guidelines to assist governors and state health officials in evaluating the most responsible manner to reopen the economies of their states at a time and manner of their choosing.\\n\\nThe guidelines, as Americans who are looking on will note, begin with what is the best criteria that our experts have developed — a downward trajectory in cases over a 14-day period of time — ensuring that states have proper capacity in their healthcare facilities.\\n\\nThe second set of proposals includes a description of recommendations for state preparedness.\\xa0 And let me say to the American people what President Trump made clear to our governors today: that our administration will continue to work day in and day out — through our task force, through FEMA — to ensure that our states have not only the medical supplies, but that we continue to rapidly expand testing across the nation.\\n\\nThe President reflected on the progress we’ve made on testing, but a few statistics for that as well, which I hope are an encouragement to the American people.\\xa0 On March 11, we had performed a total of 23,588 tests.\\xa0 Because of the public-private partnership that President Trump initiated with commercial labs across the country, that number was 83,500 by March 18.\\xa0 And as the President just said, that number is 3.5 million today.\\xa0 It is our expectation that we will have tested more than 5 million Americans before the end of the month of April, and we’ll continue to scale those resources.\\n\\nSo, testing and medical supplies will continue to be an ongoing partnership with our states, and we want our healthcare workers and people all across the country to know of our commitment to that.\\n\\nFinally, the President directed us to propose a phased approach to reopening — to reopening our economy.\\xa0 It is based on up-to-date data and readiness, and we’ll continue to provide the very best data to our states, working with their health officials.\\n\\nThe focus is on the mitigation of any risk of resurgence or the emergence of the coronavirus in states where it’s not yet emerged.\\xa0 There is a focus in the President’s new guidelines on the most vulnerable.\\n\\nAnd it’s — we made this very clear to the governors today: These new guidelines for “Opening Up America Again” can be implemented on a statewide basis or on a county-by-county basis.\\n\\nWith that, I’m happy to turn it over to Dr. Deborah Birx and, if I may, Mr. President, I’d like to also extend my admiration and appreciation to Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci, and every member of our task force that worked around the clock to develop these recommendations for opening up America.\\xa0 I know every American is grateful for your leadership and for theirs.\\n\\nDeborah.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 We’re going to go through these quickly because I know you have them, and many of you have already spoken to them on television.\\n\\nNext slide, please.\\n\\nThis is a very important slide.\\xa0 It talks about the gatekeeping — on the gatekeeping criteria to moving into phase one.\\xa0 It’s very much related to what you just saw about influenza-like illness.\\xa0 And the United States has been tracking influenza-like illnesses through the Centers of Disease Control for years.\\n\\nBoth the state and public health officials are used to watching this, county health officials are used to watching it, and frankly, every family around the United States knows how to access this on the CDC website in order to get update — up-to-date information to the communities.\\n\\nIt also looks at a syndromic emergency room-type visits — again, housed at the CDC — and really is our surveillance program that can be utilized for a lot of different illnesses, but in this case, will be utilized for respiratory diseases.\\n\\nIn addition, we are tracking the number of cases, and it must have a downward trajectory for 14 days — as well as the influenza-like illness and the syndromic illnesses — and a downward trajectory in the number of positive tests with persistence of high levels of testing.\\n\\nFor the hospitals, it’s to ensure that we can treat all patients without resorting to any crisis care and ensuring that there’s a robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers, including frontline responders with the emerging antibody tests.\\nNext slide.\\n\\nNow, just to show you what this looks like:\\xa0So what the CDC did for me, under the direction of Bob Redfield, was to chart what would the syndromic illnesses were reporting throughout the early part of March.\\xa0 And you can see, in New Orleans, respiratory diseases were starting to be seen in the emergency room.\\xa0 That is the red line.\\xa0 The cases are shown in the dark blue line.\\xa0 The gray mountain is testing, and underneath that is the blue mountain of positives.\\xa0 And you can see that the early alert was present from the emergency room about early respiratory disease.\\xa0 You can see it predated the cases.\\n\\nSo, throughout the summer, when we do not have flu to contaminate this picture, we’ll be able to follow this syndromic pattern city by city, county by county, community by community, state by state.\\n\\nNext slide.\\n\\nIn addition, the CDC has the influenza-like illness net distributed throughout the United States — very useful in the wintertime.\\xa0 That first peak is influenza B in the red; that’s this season.\\xa0 I showed you all the seasons here so you could see the seasons as they are displayed.\\n\\nThe first peak is influenza B, second peak influenza A.\\xa0 And then you can see the coronavirus.\\xa0 And you can see its decline, and it’s declining towards the baseline.\\xa0 This will allow us — again, city by city, community by community, state by state — to look for variations and an early response mode in those localities that I described.\\n\\nNext slide.\\n\\nSo hopefully you see that we’ve brought CDC and their amazing talent of individuals at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and all of their abilities to this response and also to the surveillance that we need in this response.\\n\\nBut I want to call your attention to the third bullet on this graphic.\\xa0 So we’re tracking those two pieces that I described.\\xa0 But the third bullet is about setting up sentinel surveillance sites to be able to distinguish and find asymptomatic individuals — individuals that you have heard about that may be either pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic throughout their entire disease course.\\xa0 We want to be able to find them in communities of particular vulnerability.\\n\\nSo we’ll be doing sentinel surveillance throughout nursing homes, throughout inner-city federal clinics, throughout indigenous populations, to really be able to find early alerts of asymptomatic individuals in the community.\\xa0 And both for the syndromic cases that are tested, the influenza-like cases, and the asymptomatic cases: doing contact tracing, again, with support from the Centers for Disease Control, working with each state and local government.\\n\\nIn addition, we want to make sure that all the healthcare facilities have adequate protective — personal protective devices and the equipment to handle the surge and to ensure the ICUs can handle increased capacity.\\n\\nWe want every state to have a plan for the health and safety of its workers in critical industries, and to protect the health and safety of those living in high-risk facilities, including senior care facilities, as we discussed with sentinel surveillance but also additional surveillance.\\n\\nWhen we talked with all of the states that had not had a major metro outbreak, their sentinel surveillances picked up, always, the first cases in nursing homes.\\xa0 And so this is very much a big focus of the plan moving forward.\\xa0 I won’t go into the rest of the details on this slide, but there’s quite a bit of details on the expectations of every state and local government.\\n\\nNext slide.\\n\\nYou’ll recognize this slide, it’s a — next slide, please.\\xa0 You’ll recognize this slide; it’s what we’ve been talking about in the 15 and 30 days to prevent the spread.\\xa0 It’s continuing those critical handwashing or sanitizer; avoiding touching your face at all times; disinfecting surfaces; using face covering while in public; following state and local guidelines; and, critically, staying home if you are sick.\\n\\nI know a lot of people go to the workplace when they are feeling ill.\\xa0 You know when you’re feeling ill.\\xa0 It won’t get better by going to work.\\xa0 So we’re asking again for people to stay home when they’re sick.\\n\\nNext slide is for employers to ensure that there can be social distancing and protective equipment; temperature checks; use of disinfectant in high-traffic areas, including break rooms; and ensuring that we don’t do — there’s no non-essential business travel; and then monitoring for any symptomatic individuals in the workplace.\\xa0 And again, if you come — become ill at work, to immediately to go home and ensure that there’s contact tracing of all the individuals that become sick.\\n\\nI’m going to go through the phases very quickly, but you have the details.\\n\\nPhase one: Again, you have to go through those gating criterias related to 14 days of decreasing evidence of illness and decreasing testing, despite adequate testing.\\xa0 So phase one begins with all vulnerable individuals, including those with comorbidities continuing to shelter in place and ensuring that those — the first to go out into the public are not those that are most vulnerable to bad outcomes in this disease.\\xa0 And then ensuring that we continue to do six-feet maximum physical distancing in public spaces, continuing to avoid large gatherings and all non-essential travel.\\n\\nFor the employers — next slide — again, if a vulnerable population needs to return to work and cannot be teleworking, there should be special accommodations for all vulnerable populations, as well as options for teleworking.\\xa0 We believe every employee should encourage work return in phases: from 20 percent or 25 percent, to 40 percent, to 50 percent.\\xa0 And again, minimize all non-essential travel.\\n\\nPhase one continued — next slide.\\xa0 If the schools are already closed, they should remain closed.\\xa0 All visits to senior living facilities and hospitals should be continued to be prohibited.\\xa0 Large venues, including sit-down dining, can only be operated under strict physical distancing protocols and maintaining those six feet.\\xa0 Gyms could open if they, again, adhere to strict physical distancing.\\xa0 And elective surgeries can resume on an outpatient basis.\\n\\nPhase two — next slide.\\xa0 Next slide.\\xa0 Again, you have to go through the criteria, again, of a continuation of another 14-day decline among those criterias that were in the gating.\\xa0 Again, we’re asking for all vulnerable individuals: Shelter in place.\\n\\nWe did not put a timeline on any of the phases.\\xa0 We want the governors, with the data that they have, community by community, to be setting up those timelines.\\xa0 Again, we’re asking for the public to continue to maximize physical distance; however, we increased social settings to be able to now have 50 individuals, and non-essential travel can resume.\\n\\nNext slide.\\n\\nThis is for the employers.\\xa0 We still would like to encourage telework, and the common areas should remain closed or be physically distant.\\xa0 All non-essential travel for employees can resume.\\xa0 And then, again, special accommodations for vulnerable.\\n\\nNext slide.\\n\\nThis should be a relief to many of — households that have small children.\\xa0 Schools, daycares, and camps can reopen in phase two.\\xa0 Visits to senior-living facilities, however, should remain — and hospitals — prohibited.\\xa0 Large venues can operate but solely under moderate physical distancing.\\xa0 And elective surgeries can resume on an outpatient and inpatient basis.\\n\\nPhase three: And so phase three — I won’t go through in detail — it’s essentially returning to our new normal, with all of what we talked about through all phases: continuing the good hygiene practices, continuing the respect for spaces between individuals, because we know that we still have an issue with asymptomatic spread.\\n\\nI do believe with this plan that we’re both confronting the issue of finding symptomatic individuals through our networks with early alert, as well as those who come and present to different hospitals and emergency room with testing and contact tracing, but critically have put in place what we believe is a safety net through asymptomatic sentinel surveillance that is centered around our most vulnerable groups — between nursing homes and our Native American people and indigenous populations, and our inner city groups that we know may be in multi-generational households and have unique risk.\\n\\nI’ll stop there, Mr.\\xa0President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Please, Tony.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Thank you very much, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 So as you’ve seen just now from the detailed presentation from Dr. Birx, this is a rather robust program for re-entering into normality.\\n\\nThere’s a lot of details here, and I know it’ll take a little bit of time to digest them all.\\xa0 So what I thought would be good, since I really want to be brief to allow time for questions, is to kind of take us back to the discussions that we’ve had here before and why this is a natural evolution from what we had said before.\\n\\nYou might recall that, on a few occasions when I was up here before you, I told you that when we get to the point where we’re going to take those steps towards trying to get back to some form of normality, that it would not be a light switch that you could turn on and off.\\xa0 I meant that in two different components.\\n\\nFirst of all, that we are a very large country and we have different dynamics in the country.\\xa0 We have areas of the country that have gone through a terrible ordeal, and others that fortunately have gone and gotten — gotten through this rather lightly.\\xa0 So that’s the first thing.\\n\\nThe second thing is that light switch, on and off, is the exact opposite of what you see here, which is a gradual gradation.\\xa0 But the first thing and the only thing in mind, as the health people here — and my colleagues, who are either physicians, scientists, or public health issues — the predominant and completely driving element that we put into this was the safety and the health of the American public.\\n\\nAnd I know there are a lot of other considerations that go into opening — considerations that you’ve heard of right from this podium.\\xa0 But the dominating drive of this was to make sure that this is done in the safest way possible.\\n\\nSo let me just make a couple of comments to just reiterate more, from a broader standpoint, the things that Dr. Birx did so well in a very a granular detail.\\n\\nFirst of all, in order to even consider getting into the phasing, you have to pass a hurdle.\\xa0 And that’s the hurdle that we refer to as “gating in.”\\xa0 Now, when you think about it and look at the map of the country and look at the differences in different parts of the country, you will see that there are some regions, states, locations that are going to be almost already into some of that gating, and will have already fulfilled some of those criteria.\\xa0 Others, because of the dynamics of the outbreak in the area, will take longer to be able to do that.\\xa0 But you don’t get to phase one until you get through the gating.\\n\\nAnd then in order to make sure that safety and health is the dominant issue, the design of the phases were just that.\\xa0 You go into phase one.\\xa0 If you get no rebound and you satisfy the gating for yet again a second time, then you go to phase two.\\xa0 If you have no rebound and you satisfy the gating criteria for a third time, you go into phase three.\\xa0 So there are multiple checkpoints of safety there.\\n\\nSo as I’ve said, from this podium, when we were talking about the first 15 days of the mitigation and then we extended it another 30 days, I essentially pleaded with the American public to say, “Let us make sure we do the best that we can to accomplish that.”\\n\\nAnd, in fact, mitigation works.\\xa0 You saw the charts that the Vice President and that Dr. Birx put up.\\xa0 It worked.\\xa0 And what we hope and I believe we will be successful: If we carefully do this — again, with the attention to the safety and health of the American public — that we will be able to — and it will be staggered.\\xa0 Not every state, not every region is going to do it at the same time; that’s clearly obvious because of the very dynamics of the outbreak.\\n\\nBut we feel confident that, sooner or later, we will get to the point — hopefully sooner, with safety as the most important thing — to a point where we can get back to some form of normality.\\n\\nThe one thing I liked about it that — that Dr. Birx said so well — is that no matter what phase you’re in, there are certain fundamental things that we’ve done that are not like it was in September and October.\\xa0 You want to call it the “new normal” — you can call it whatever you want.\\xa0 But even if you are in phase one, two, three, it’s not, “Okay, game over.”\\xa0 It’s not.\\xa0 It’s going to be a way that we protect ourselves because, as we know, and as I’ve said from this podium, it may very well be — as we go the cycle around — that there’ll be this virus that wants to come back to us.\\n\\nI think we’re going to be able to handle that.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Great.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Tony, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Fauci, so I assume that there’s also a phase four, which is after a vaccine is developed —\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and available to everybody.\\xa0 So, a question on phase three being the “new normal.”\\xa0 Are we, during that phase, going to be able to see things like packed arenas for sporting events, large crowds, concerts?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 The answer is: It is conceivable that we will be able to do that.\\xa0 I think there will always have to be attention to making sure that we don’t do all that packing in together.\\xa0 I think we’ll be able to have sports events in that phase where you actually have participants there.\\xa0 I’m not sure you’re going to be able to do that uniformly and evenly, temporally, with everyone.\\xa0 But when people get to that phase — paying attention to the fact that if there is a rebound of any sort — that when you’re in that phase, you can respond to that or you put it back and go in the other way.\\n\\nSo, the flexibility is that there may be some setbacks.\\xa0 I mean, let’s face it, this — this is uncharted water.\\xa0 There may be some setbacks, and we may have to pull back a little and then go forward.\\n\\nBut, Jon, the direct answer to your question: I do see us getting more towards normal.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President.\\xa0 Mr. President, if you — if you take a look at the gating criteria as outlined in these guidelines that are — there are at least a handful of states — I just looked at the trend lines — Idaho, Wyoming, Hawaii, Montana — that look like they’ve already satisfied that gating criteria.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 In your call with the governors this afternoon, did you hear back from any states who said, “We’re already there.\\xa0 We could start the process now.”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I did.\\xa0 I heard from a number of governors that said they’re in very good shape.\\xa0 I also heard — not only from the call, but I heard from some of the governors previous — and I think you’ll have some very good things to report over the next few days about states opening up.\\n\\nAnd I think, Jon, having to do with your call on — on sports: Depending on the area, depending where we’re talking about, you’re going to have large areas of our country where this has not been or has been totally eradicated.\\xa0 You’ll be able to have those full arenas.\\n\\nNow, with everything being said, a lot of great work has been done on vaccines, but you have a testing process.\\xa0 Therapeutics, likewise — we have a lot of great things happening, therapeutically.\\xa0 That will be a step further.\\n\\nBut, in terms of sports, they’ll probably start off — I — as you know, I spoke to the commissioners yesterday — almost, I guess, of every sport.\\xa0 And many of them are going to be starting without the fans.\\xa0 So it’ll be made for television.\\xa0 The good old days, made for television.\\xa0 And it’ll go that way, and then fans will start coming in.\\xa0 Maybe they’ll be separated by two seats.\\xa0 And then ultimately, we want to have packed arenas.\\xa0 When the virus is gone, we’re going to have packed arenas and we’re going to be back to enjoying sports the way they’re supposed to be.\\xa0 And the same thing can be said for restaurants.\\n\\nSo, at a certain point in time, when the virus is gone, we’re going to be back to normal.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President and the doctors, can you clarify then: Is the 30-day period to stop the spread — are those mitigation efforts still in place or have they been replaced by this new guidance?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they’re going to be in place, to a large extent, and it also depends on the governors, what they want to do.\\xa0 You have very different states.\\xa0 If you look at Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota — that’s a lot different than New York.\\xa0 It’s a lot different than New Jersey.\\xa0 So it’s going to be very dependent on the governor.\\n\\nWe’re recommending — as you see in the charts, we’re recommending certain things.\\xa0 They’ll be in place, dependent on what the governor wants to do.\\xa0 If we see something wrong, we will be expressing ourselves very strongly.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Does this mean that states such as Montana and Utah that already meet that gating period, will they be able to go to phase one as early as, say tomorrow, if the governor decides?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You’re talking about those states that are in great shape already?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They will be able to go literally tomorrow, yes — because they’ve met all of the guidelines if you go back — you’re going back 14 days, you’re going back even a month.\\xa0 And they have — the ones that I’m thinking about, the ones that I’ve already spoken to governors about — they’ve met those guidelines, actually, pretty long ago.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, what’s your message to those protesters we’re seeing — we saw a lot in Michigan, but in other states — that are saying that they are refusing to comply with the stay-at-home orders issued by governors and local officials?\\xa0 I mean, isn’t it important for everybody to go along with this as we go through these phases?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they’ve been going through it a long time, Jon, and it’s been a tough process for people.\\xa0 You know, I told you this: There’s death and there’s problems in staying at home too.\\xa0 It’s not just, “Isn’t it wonderful to stay at home?”\\xa0 They’re having — they’re suffering.\\xa0 This country wasn’t built on that principle; it was built on an exact opposite principle, actually.\\n\\nAnd I watched, in one particular state, where they were — they want to get back.\\xa0 They want to get back.\\xa0 They were very strict sanctions that were put on people; that was probably the most strict of all.\\n\\nBut, I just think the American people have been incredible.\\xa0 When you look at —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But would you urge those —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Jon, when you look at what they’ve done, when you look at what they’ve been through, when you look at all of the death and all of the problems and all of the sickness, when you look at what’s happened, I just think the American people have been incredible.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But would you urge those protesters to listen to local authorities?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think they’re listening.\\xa0 I think they listen to me.\\xa0 They seem to be protesters that like me and respect this opinion.\\xa0 And my opinion is the same as just about all of the governors.\\n\\nThey all want to open.\\xa0 Nobody wants to stay shut, but they want to open safely.\\xa0 So do I.\\xa0 But we have large sections of the country right now that can start thinking about opening.\\xa0 There’ll be some mitigation and they’ll keep it going for a period of time — including masks, by the way — in areas that you wouldn’t even think.\\n\\nI asked a question today.\\xa0 I said, “Why would they wear masks in Wyoming or Montana or North Dakota?”\\xa0 And that’s if somebody should come in from an area that isn’t so successful, in terms of what they’ve done.\\n\\nSo, that will be a governor’s choice, and we’ll have no problem with it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you spoke this afternoon with your new congressional advisory groups — 32 bipartisan members of the House, 65 bipartisan members of the Senate — one of the big topics was the fact that the Small Business Association loan pot of $350 billion has hit the cap.\\xa0 It’s exhausted.\\xa0 There’s nothing moving on the $250 billion to replenish it.\\n\\nWhat did you tell those bipartisan groups today about getting the move on to get some more money into the hands of small businesses?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 So, just for the viewers watching this or hearing you ask that question: “Exhausted” is a good thing, not a bad thing.\\xa0 It went quickly.\\xa0 It is so popular.\\xa0 The banks have been incredible, including 4,000 community banks.\\xa0 Four thousand.\\xa0 Most people didn’t know you had that many banks.\\xa0 Four thousand —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The bad thing is they still need a loan, though.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 What they want is people want to keep this going.\\xa0 And we’re doing it to keep the small businesses open and to keep the workers paid.\\xa0 And we have a $250 billion request.\\xa0 The Democrats like it.\\xa0 The Republicans love it.\\xa0 And to be honest, I think it’s going to — something is going to be happening.\\xa0 I hope so, because this is a very popular program.\\xa0 It was really executed flawlessly.\\n\\nThe first day, they changed an application a little bit.\\xa0 There was — but when you look at what Bank of America did and what Wells Fargo did, and Citi and a lot of the banks — but when you ask —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So what’s the hold-up now?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — when you look at what all of the community banks did, it’s been really incredible.\\n\\nWell, we’re negotiating with Democrats, and they should, frankly, approve it quickly.\\xa0 This is a great thing for our country.\\xa0 It’s a great thing for small business and for the workers.\\xa0 And we’re having a hard time getting them to approve it.\\xa0 I think it’s going to happen.\\xa0 It should happen really unanimously.\\xa0 But they’re trying to get things and we’re not too happy with what they’re trying to get.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 First, can you just say which states specifically you guys think have hit the gating requirements at this point?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’d rather not say that, but you’ll be seeing it very soon.\\xa0 I mean, they’ll be — I’d rather have the governor be able to — the governors be able to announce.\\xa0 And they’re very proud of it.\\xa0 They’ve worked hard.\\xa0 Some are in an area that’s less susceptible and some really was done, I think we can say, through talent.\\xa0 They really worked very hard.\\n\\nAnd, you know, we have some states that got too much credit for what they’ve done.\\xa0 Frankly, I could name you a couple of those too.\\xa0 And I could name you a couple of them.\\xa0 And we have others that haven’t been given credit that have done a phenomenal job.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And then, part of the guidance seems to sort of shift to states and companies the burden not just of additional testing and surveillance, but also the sort of new normal on which, you know, there’s smaller crowds in restaurants and bars and arenas.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, that’s not going to be normal.\\xa0 There’s not going to be a new normal where somebody has been having, for 25 years, 158 seats in a restaurant, and now he’s got 30 or he’s got 60 — because that wouldn’t work.\\xa0 That’s not normal.\\xa0 No.\\xa0 Normal will be if he has the 158 or 68 seats.\\xa0 And that’s going to happen.\\xa0 And it’s going to happen, relatively quickly, we hope.\\n\\nBut that’s our normal.\\xa0 Our normal is if you have 100,000 people in an Alabama football game — or 110,000, to be exact — we want 110,000 people there.\\xa0 We want every seat occupied.\\xa0 Normal is not going to be where you have a game with 50,000 people.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 But to that point: I mean, best-case scenario, that happens in these states that are doing really well in a month.\\xa0 Obviously for, I think, a lot of other states, it’s going to be longer than that.\\n\\nSo my question is: What is the federal government going to do to sort of help especially companies, but states and local governments in those positions pay for what is now going to be an even longer (inaudible)?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re going to be watching over.\\xa0 We’re going to see that everything is working out smoothly.\\xa0 We’re in very strong communication with the governors.\\n\\nWe’re going to be helping with testing.\\xa0 They’re going to be doing the testing.\\xa0 It’s got to be a localized thing, and it really has been since I’ve been involved.\\xa0 Because I came in and the federal government supposed to do testing of parking lots in the middle of a certain state that’s 2,000 miles away.\\xa0 It’s ridiculous.\\xa0 But the testing has been so incredible.\\n\\nTwo things: testing and ventilators.\\xa0 Ventilators are really tough.\\xa0 They’re very complex.\\xa0 They’re very expensive.\\xa0 They’re, you know, very sophisticated machines.\\xa0 Some are unbelievably sophisticated.\\xa0 What we built — you saw General Motors yesterday.\\xa0 Thousands are being issued.\\xa0 We have 11 companies building them.\\xa0 We have not had one complaint in the last week and half, which is surge time.\\n\\nDon’t forget, when they were calling, they were calling because in two weeks, in four weeks, in five weeks, they’re going to need ventilators — not because they need them right now.\\xa0 And we were right on our counts. \\xa0And nobody that wanted a ventilator didn’t get a ventilator.\\xa0 Plus, we have additional, if there is a surge.\\xa0 We hope there’s not going to be a surge at all.\\xa0 But we’re going to be able to build up the stockpiles of states who didn’t have them, who should have had them.\\n\\nAnd we’re also going to have a big stockpile in the federal government, and we’ll be able to help foreign countries — countries that need help.\\xa0 Because you have comp- — look, you have countries who will never be able to build a ventilator.\\xa0 It’s tough stuff.\\xa0 We’re uniquely talented in the sense that we can do things that nobody else can do.\\n\\nWe’ll get right back to you, John.\\n\\nPeter, in the back.\\xa0 Peter.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thanks.\\xa0 You said you didn’t want to name the states that might be ready to go.\\xa0 So can you give us some — or maybe the experts, Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci — give us some sense of how many?\\xa0 Yesterday, you said 29 states were in good shape.\\xa0 Do you think as many as 29 or —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think — yeah, Peter.\\xa0 I think 29 states are in that ballgame, not open — not for opening, but I think they’ll be able to open relatively soon.\\xa0 I think the remainder are just getting better.\\xa0 Look, New York, New Jersey are having very tough times, and they’ll be there.\\xa0 They’ll be there at some point.\\xa0 But they’re not going to be one of the earlier states; they’re going to be later, obviously.\\n\\nI just spoke with the governor of New Jersey.\\xa0 We just spoke with Mike and a couple of folks.\\xa0 We had a great talk with him.\\xa0 Phil is a terrific guy.\\xa0 He’s working very hard — Democrat — but we get along.\\xa0 He’s working very, very hard.\\xa0 I guess, the fact that he’s right next to this big massive city where everybody is very closely — you know, they’re — they’re together.\\xa0 And New Jersey has been hit unbelievably hard — as hard as — as hard as anybody, in the true sense.\\xa0\\xa0 But they’re doing a great job in New Jersey.\\n\\nThat doesn’t mean, Peter — that doesn’t mean that they’re going to be opening next week.\\xa0 That’s not one that’s going to be.\\xa0 But we have a lot of states that, through location, through luck, and also through a lot of talent — we have states, through a lot of talent, are in a very good position, and they’re getting ready to open and over the next very short period of time.\\n\\nIt’s going to be up to the governors.\\xa0 We’re going to work with them, we’re going to help them, but it’s going to be up to the governors.\\xa0 I think they’re going to — I think you’re going to see quite a few states starting to open.\\xa0 And I call it a “beautiful puzzle.”\\xa0 You have 50 pieces, all very different, but when it’s all done, it’s a mosaic.\\xa0 When it’s all done, it’s going to be, I think, a very beautiful picture.\\n\\nAnd very important is what Dr. Fauci said: It could be that, sometime in the fall, there’ll be some flare-ups.\\xa0 We’re going to be in a great position with everything we’ve done and everything we’ve learned.\\xa0 This was something that nobody ever saw before: such contagion and very, very powerful.\\n\\nPeople don’t realize because you — we all probably have friends — I have a number of people that were just great people who were just decimated by what happened.\\xa0 Some were — some were — some are dead right now.\\xa0 They’re dead.\\xa0 They went into a hospital.\\xa0 One called me; he said, “I tested positive.”\\xa0 Four days later, he was dead.\\xa0 The following day after he said that, he was unconscious.\\xa0 So this is a tough deal.\\n\\nAt the same time, some people got sniffles and they didn’t even realize they had a problem.\\xa0 And they are supposedly immune.\\xa0 We’re going to find out about that.\\xa0 Even that’s a little bit soon because we don’t know how long the immunity lasts.\\n\\nBut, Peter, some states are in great shape, and they’re really in great shape to open.\\xa0 And I think you’ll have quite a few states opening soon.\\xa0 And they’re going to be very vigilant, they’re going to be very careful.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 (Inaudible.)\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The public — sorry.\\xa0 The public health — a lot of public health experts have said that this would be better done if there were comprehensive surveillance testing, which we’re obviously not in the position to do.\\xa0 I wonder if maybe Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci can tell us whether —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure, we can do that.\\xa0 Either one, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — they going to feel comfortable —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Tony and I will — Dr. Fauci and I will do it together.\\xa0 I just wanted to — that’s why I wanted to put up the syndromic and influenza-like illness piece.\\xa0 Because what is key in this is the early alerts and getting in there before they even know they have a problem.\\xa0 And I think CDC has been remarkable in building these platforms.\\xa0 Dr. Redfield integrated them so they’re all on the same website.\\xa0 If you look at COVID-19, go into “Cases,” you can find all of the data.\\xa0 And the beauty of it is the states are used to utilizing that through flu season.\\n\\nSo the testing and contact tracing — and Dr. Redfield will be putting people in every single state to make sure that CDC is standing beside the state and local health officials to make sure that all of those cases are immediately identified and contact traced.\\n\\nI think what’s new and what’s really critical is this constant sentinel surveillance for asymptomatic individuals in communities that we know are particularly vulnerable.\\xa0 And that hasn’t been done in flu before, and I think that’s going to be the added dividend that’s really focused on who is most vulnerable and how do we get the fastest alert by generally screening people without symptoms.\\xa0 So people who are just coming to the clinic will be screened for COVID-19.\\xa0 And we do have enough testing capacity to do both that surveillance piece, as well as the diagnostic piece and contact tracing.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just a follow-up.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Tony, did you want to say something?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 No, actually — it — you know, people have gotten confused about that, because in the beginning, when we were focusing really on just mitigation and really trying to keep peaks down and trying to worry about ventilators and PPEs and things like that — well, now, when you get a little bit more grace period, you can start figuring out: What is the penetrance of this virus in society?\\xa0 What are we missing in people who might be infected?\\xa0 What is the percentage of those people that are out there?\\n\\nThat’s going to inform us greatly for a number of things, including the level, once we prove that antibody test that you have is really protective.\\xa0 And we still don’t know that yet; we’re going to find that out.\\xa0 We may get a good feel of what the level of protection might be in society.\\xa0 But we don’t know that yet.\\xa0 So it’s going to give us information as to what the vulnerable areas are and how we need to respond.\\n\\nRemember, there’s two types of things: antibody tests and tests for the diagnosis of who has the disease.\\xa0 One you need for contact tracing; the other you want to — need for finding out what’s in society.\\xa0 We’re going to have both of those much, much better as we go in the next weeks and months.\\xa0 And by the time we get into the fall, I think we’re going to be in pretty good shape.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Peter, I just have to say that, as we see a hotspot possibly developing — maybe not — but if we see a hotspot developing, we’ve learned a lot.\\xa0 We’ll be able to suppress it, whack it.\\xa0 We’ll be able to do things that people weren’t even thinking about because nobody has ever gone through this.\\n\\nIn 1917, they went through something that was similar.\\xa0 Probably not as contagious, probably more powerful in certain other ways. \\xa0But we are going to be able to suppress it, we think.\\xa0 And we’re going to watch it very closely.\\xa0 We’re going to — we’re going to be able to watch things very closely.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Bob, please.\\n\\nDR. REDFIELD:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 I think what’s really important is during this — we’re bringing people back to work and our economy back to work.\\xa0 And what’s going to go back is that we’re going to be very aggressively focused on early case recognition, isolation, and contact tracing.\\n\\nIn the event that we just went through, unfortunately, in — as we started, we were very capable of doing that.\\xa0 When the initial cases all came from China — all the way through January, all the way through to the end of February — we were able to identify cases early, the first 14; do the contacts — do the contact tracing, over 800 contacts.\\xa0 We identified that two of those contacts were actually infected.\\xa0 We were able to isolate them.\\xa0 We were able to contain the outbreak.\\n\\nWe’re about to enter a new phase of this where we’re going back to containment.\\xa0 And mitigation is going to continue, as Dr. Birx and others have said.\\xa0 Some of the things that we’ve learned to do, we’re going to continue.\\n\\nBut the major thrust of how we’re going to control and make sure that we continue to keep this nation open is early case recognition, isolation, and contact tracing.\\xa0 That’s the fundamentals of public health.\\xa0 That’s what we’re going to do.\\n\\nYou see we have very good surveillance systems that are going to help us.\\xa0 As we see these cases sporadically across the country, we’ve got to jump on them with early diagnosis, isolation, and contact tracing.\\xa0 And that’s what CDC is going to continue to help build that capacity in the states across this nation.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And one other thing, because we — we discussed this today with the senators — we had the senators, we have the congressmen and women.\\xa0 There’ll be some areas of our country — wide open plains, wide open spaces — with not that many people, relatively speaking, where you’re not going to have to do that.\\xa0 Senators were saying there is no reason to do that in certain states, in certain areas, where you have the wide open.\\n\\nIn other cases, we will be doing that.\\xa0 So we’ll be following it.\\xa0 Largely, that also will be a function of governors.\\xa0 They know their states.\\xa0 So, largely, that’s going to be a function of governors.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, you mentioned the — I think you used the term “clear scientific benchmarks on testing.”\\xa0 And the main periscope that I think you guys are talking about is the ILI syndromic, as well as the surveillance and the sentinel testing.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you opening things up, then, without doing — I just want to be clear:\\xa0Are you opening things up without doing widespread testing?\\xa0 Is that because you don’t have the capacity or you don’t think it’s necessary?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We do have the capacity, but, you know, you have states without any problem.\\xa0 You have states with few cases, and those few cases have healed.\\xa0 You have states with very little death, relatively speaking.\\xa0 As I said, one is too many, but you have states with very little, and frankly, they’re at a point where they have almost nothing.\\n\\nSo this is a much different case than a New York or New Jersey where they’re going through — frankly, they go through hell.\\xa0 And if you look at New York — I’m looking at bed count, because you have to look at bed count, and it’s really dropped.\\xa0 We built the Javits Center with 2,900 beds.\\xa0 And it was — I mean, they built it in four days.\\xa0 They did an incredible job — the Army Corps of Engineers.\\xa0 It was not used very much.\\xa0 We sent the ship — the hospital ship into New York Harbor, and it was not used.\\xa0 Then we went COVID, and it still was not used very much, because the bed count has gone way down — way, way down.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So in these states, when do you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — when you see yourself getting back to campaigning then?\\xa0 I mean —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 This is — this is not campaigning.\\xa0 I want to make the country better.\\xa0 I don’t care about campaigning.\\xa0 This is — this is about making our country better.\\xa0 I think this team has been incredible, whether it’s Army Corps of Engineers, whether it’s FEMA.\\n\\nOne thing that happened on the call today that I noticed more than anything is Pete Gaynor.\\xa0 So many governors that, “I want to thank you.”\\xa0 Pete Gaynor called up.\\xa0 They had tornadoes in a big part of our country this weekend — this week.\\xa0 And they were all saying that he has been unbelievable.\\xa0 They called one after another.\\xa0 They were thanking us for — that’s FEMA.\\xa0 And they were thanking us.\\n\\nNo, I want to heal this country.\\xa0 This — this is a war.\\xa0 We’ve been through a war.\\xa0 We have an invisible, as opposed to a visible, enemy.\\xa0 I think, in many ways, the invisible enemy is much more dangerous, is much tougher.\\n\\nIn the G7 today, I went through country after country.\\xa0 We were there.\\xa0 We all get along great.\\xa0 Angela Merkel and Shinzo Abe — Prime Minister of Japan — and all of them.\\xa0 And their — their countries have been devastated by this.\\xa0 Their economies have been devastated by this.\\xa0 A hundred and eighty-four countries all over the world.\\n\\nAnd we went through one after another.\\xa0 And I was angry because it should have been told to us.\\xa0 It should have been told to us early.\\xa0 It should have been told to us a lot sooner.\\xa0 People knew it was happening, and people didn’t want to talk about it.\\xa0 I don’t know why, but we’re going to get to the bottom of it.\\xa0 But people should have —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Angry with China?\\xa0 Or — I mean —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0 People — I’m not saying anything.\\xa0 I’m saying people should have told us about this.\\xa0 They should have told the rest of the world too.\\n\\nWhen I looked at Germany talking today, when I looked at France talking today — the European Union was there represented; that represents a lot of countries — their economies have been devastated, but they’re going to build them back.\\xa0 But we’re going to build this economy back bigger, better, stronger than ever before.\\xa0 You watch.\\xa0 And we have stimulus.\\n\\nAnd we’re going to do things, whether it’s infrastructure — which we would like to be able to do — our roads, our tunnels, our highways, our bridges.\\xa0 Our bridges need help.\\xa0 You know, a lot of you have reported on our bridges.\\xa0 A lot of bridges are in bad shape.\\xa0 They should have been fixed 25 years ago, and they’re still standing.\\xa0 They have to be fixed.\\nSo hopefully we’ll get an infrastructure bill.\\n\\nThe good news is the interest rate is close to zero.\\xa0 And zero interest is a good thing when it comes to rebuilding your infrastructure and your country back.\\n\\nPlease, in the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, walk us through the calendar, if you would.\\xa0 When it comes to Memorial Day or even Pentecost in May; you’ve got July 4th, Labor Day weekend — what would you anticipate at each of those milestones?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I don’t like to anticipate because you have a couple of states that are in difficulty that have made a lot of progress, by the way, and they’re either here or they’re heading down.\\xa0 But — so I’m not going to go in, in terms of dates, but I think we’re going very quickly now.\\xa0 I really believe.\\n\\nI think we’re going to have a lot of states open relatively soon.\\xa0 We’re beating the date.\\xa0 I set a date of May 1st, and, you know, here we are.\\xa0 And I think you’re going to have some nice surprises over the next few days.\\xa0 And that’ll be before.\\xa0 And that’s big stuff.\\xa0 Some of those states are big.\\xa0 They’re big stuff.\\xa0 Very important states.\\xa0 And it’s going to be added on and on.\\n\\nAnd as we — look, I don’t want anyone coming back that isn’t in position to come back.\\xa0 The last thing we want is for, let’s say, a New York to come back too soon or a New Jersey to come back to soon.\\xa0 We want them to come back when they’re ready.\\xa0 But they’re really heading in a good direction, and I think it’ll be much faster than people think.\\xa0 I think it’ll be quicker.\\xa0 But it’s got to be safe.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, please.\\xa0 In the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Has the government modeled the possibility — what might happen, how many deaths might occur — if there is a widespread resurgence?\\xa0 If this just doesn’t work, I mean, how many deaths are we talking about here?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So, if we didn’t do what we did, we were talking about up to 2.2 million deaths.\\xa0 So that’s five times almost what we lost in the Civil War.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 But I’m talking about from here on out.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 If — if everything happens properly and if we continue to go the way we’re going now, we will be significantly less than the lowest number with mitigation.\\xa0 So we’ll be significantly less.\\xa0 And it’s still a lot of people.\\xa0 One is too many, as I’ve said.\\xa0 One is too many.\\xa0 But we’ll be under the number of 100,000, which was the minimum number projected by the model.\\xa0 And I give — I give everybody up here, I give all of the people that we’ve been — I mean, we — this was a military operation with a lot of private help.\\n\\nIf you look at Roche, they were incredible. \\xa0If you look at Johnson & Johnson now, what they’re doing — they are very far advanced on a vaccine.\\xa0 I think, therapeutically, we have some of these genius company — they’re truly genius companies.\\xa0 I’m seeing them.\\xa0 I’m meeting with the people that run the companies and scientists.\\xa0 And, I mean, what they’re doing is incredible.\\xa0 It’s incredible.\\xa0 It’s a beautiful thing to see.\\n\\nSo I think we’re very far advanced, and I think we’re going to be in great shape soon.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I know you don’t want to mention specific states, but what about Washington and California?\\xa0 Do you have guidance for —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Do you mean Washington State or Washington here?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Washington State and California.\\xa0 Do you have guidance for them?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, that’s going to be up to them.\\xa0 They’re going to have to make that determination.\\xa0 I mean, the governor of Washington was saying that he can’t find cotton because — you know, a swab is a very easy thing to get.\\xa0 And swab is — essentially, it’s a little bit more sophisticated than a Q-tip.\\xa0 And you got to be able to go out and find.\\xa0 You know, the federal government shouldn’t be forced to go and do everything.\\n\\nWhat we’ve done is incredible.\\xa0 What we’ve done are the — the ones that can’t be done — like, for instance, the ventilators — that can’t be done by anybody but a very powerful, very great manufacturing country, which is what we are and what we’re really getting to be.\\n\\nAnd I have to tell you, some of these companies, what — the job they’ve done — and we’re going to recognize them pretty soon — the job they’ve done in terms of getting out, in particular, ventilators, because ventilators are so hard.\\xa0 They’re so — I say, and some people say, “Oh, it’s not really as complicated.”\\xa0 Well, it’s like building a car.\\xa0 And you know what?\\xa0 The price is the same too.\\xa0 It’s a very expensive thing for a sophisticated ventilator.\\xa0 It’s very, very tough stuff.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\xa0 In the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, let me toss this question up to you and to the doctors as well.\\xa0 Truthfully, for those states that aren’t ready to go to phase one — to get through these phases, do we have an idea of how many millions, tens of millions of tests they’re going to need for them to get through these phases?\\xa0 Any number out there?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I’ll let you —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Tests of any sort?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’ll let you guys —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yeah, so — I mean, I — you’ve heard me talk about tests for a while from the podium, and I think what has happened over the last several weeks is hospitals and clinics that could move to the more point-of-care tests move to those point-of-care tests.\\xa0 And what it’s left is an amazing array of capacity that exists in the country for at least a million more tests per week.\\n\\nSo we have a whole team working lab by lab to see what it would take to turn on all of those labs that aren’t running the pieces of equipment now.\\xa0 So you see in the system — I just said to you there’s a million more tests per week — that we have tests sitting there and equipment sitting there.\\xa0 And now we have to really deal with each single lab to really figure out what they need.\\n\\nAnd I just want to thank Administrator Verma — Seema Verma — who went through with us, and thanks to the lab directors, they really explained to us: highly technical difficulty to run some of these big pieces of equipment.\\xa0 Because you have to allocate the samples, you have to centrifuge, you have to put them on the machine.\\xa0 It takes a tech full-time.\\xa0 At $50 a test, it wasn’t enough to hire another technician to run the machine full-time.\\xa0 So at $100 a test, it is.\\n\\nSo those are the kinds of changes we have to make bit by bit by bit.\\xa0 But that alone doubles our testing capacity per week.\\n\\nSo we’re committed to work with laboratories to answer every one of their issues with the state and local governments. And, I think, frankly, in every conversation I have — and the governors will say, “I need 5,000 people tested.”\\xa0 And I say, “Well, at the University of X, there are 6,700 tests waiting for you.”\\xa0 So it’s more of making sure that every governor and every public health official knows exactly where every lab is and where the tests are so we can create with them a real understanding so all these tests can be run.\\n\\nSo, yes, there is twice the capacity right now.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 May I follow up?\\xa0 You’re — you’re assuring the governors can have these tests?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So, just so you understand — excuse me.\\xa0 Just so you understand, we have tremendous testing capacity.\\xa0 You look at the labs; they’re actually saying, “Send us.”\\xa0 And the reason it’s gone down is because we have so many other tests that, frankly, are easier because you don’t have to send.\\xa0 They’re on site.\\xa0 And now we have the new saliva test that just came out yesterday, which is probably the easiest of them all, when you get right down to it.\\n\\nAnd I was seeing where Rutgers is involved — great school, great college, great university — and they’re using that.\\xa0 So many people are going to want to use that.\\xa0 But they don’t have to use the labs anymore.\\xa0 The labs are great, highly accurate.\\xa0 Very, very great companies.\\xa0 But they’re down.\\xa0 They have tremendous — as that goes down, you have additional capacity.\\n\\nWe have tremendous testing capacity.\\xa0 And to think that a month and a half ago, we had virtually nothing.\\n\\nI just want to conclude: We’re opening up our great country again.\\xa0 It’s going to be over a period of time.\\xa0 We’re working with some really great people — people that have become friends of mine.\\xa0 And I’m including Democrat governors that have really done a good job; Republican governors, most of whom I’ve known that have done a really good job.\\xa0 They’re all working together. We’re all for the —\\xa0with few exceptions, the relationship has been outstanding.\\nAnd I want to thank Doctor, Doctor, and Mike.\\xa0 I want to thank the Director.\\xa0 Fantastic job.\\xa0 We’ve all done — by the way, head of the FDA, he has broken hurdles that years ago, even recently, would have taken years.\\xa0 He was — he got one thing done in one day that would have taken two years for somebody else.\\xa0 So I want to thank Dr. Hahn of the FDA.\\n\\nWe have incredible people that we’re working with.\\xa0 And we’re going to bring our country back, and it’s going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\\xa0 We have learned a lot.\\xa0 We’ve learned a lot about ourselves.\\n\\nI want to thank everybody.\\xa0 And most importantly, I want to thank the American people.\\xa0 Thank you all very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A quick question on grocery stores, sir.\\xa0 Mr. Vice President, a question about Kroger.\\xa0 Kroger grocery stores asked those grocery personnel to be classified as secondary first responders or emergency personnel so they can get access to testing.\\xa0 Is that something that the federal government would be open to?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re working with all of our (inaudible).\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nEND\\n\\n7:19 P.M.

       "  'text': 'Rose Garden\\n\\n5:49 P.M. EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 A big day today at the White House.\\xa0 All of American society is engaged and mobilized in the war against the invisible enemy.\\xa0 While we must remain vigilant, it is clear that our aggressive strategy is working — and very strongly working, I might add.\\n\\nNew cases are declining throughout the New York metropolitan area.\\xa0 Cases in the Detroit and Denver metro areas are flat.\\xa0 Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; Philadelphia; and St. Louis are showing great signs of progress, and new cases in Houston and New Orleans are declining.\\n\\nThe battle continues, but the data suggests that nationwide we have passed the peak on new cases.\\xa0 Hopefully that will continue and we will continue to make great progress.\\n\\nThese encouraging developments have put us in a very strong position to finalize guidelines for states on reopening the country, which we’ll be announcing.\\xa0 We’re going to be talking about that tomorrow.\\xa0 We’ll be having a news conference tomorrow sometime during the afternoon.\\xa0 We’re going to be announcing guidelines, and we’ll be talking about various states.\\xa0 And it’s very exciting.\\n\\nIt’s been a horrible time to see such death and destruction, especially when you come out of what was the greatest economy in the history of the world.\\xa0 The greatest.\\xa0 There’s never been an economy like what we had produced, but we’ll produce it again.\\xa0 And I think we’ll produce it again very fast.\\n\\nThe medical and healthcare advances we’ve made are critical to our continued progress.\\xa0 We’ve rapidly developed the most expansive and accurate testing system anywhere in the world and have completed more than 3.3 million tests.\\xa0 To date, we have authorized 48 separate coronavirus tests, and the FDA is working with 300 companies and labs to widen our capacity still further.\\n\\nToday, Abbott Labs announced that it has developed an antibody test that will determine if someone has been previously infected with the coronavirus and potentially developed immunity.\\xa0 It’s a great test.\\xa0 The company says these tests could be available to screen up to 20 million people in a matter of weeks.\\n\\nMy administration is also distributing vast amounts of medical supplies to states across the country through Project Air Bridge, which has been an amazing success.\\xa0 We have completed 44 flights — and these are flights of very, very large airplanes, massive cargo planes — 44 flights of critical supplies as of today and an additional 56 flights scheduled in the near future. \\xa0We have some very brilliant people working on this.\\xa0 It’s logistically incredible what they’ve done.\\xa0 And we’ve also been working on this with the military.\\xa0 And these people have been — the genius of all of them together, it has been incredible to watch.\\n\\nIn total, through all channels, the federal government has developed and delivered 39.4 million N95 masks, 431 million gloves, 57 million surgical masks, and 10.2 million gowns.\\xa0 We ordered 500 million masks, and they’ll be coming shortly.\\xa0 And we’ve distributed 100 million masks.\\n\\nFollowing our use of the Defense Production Act, GM announced that its first ventilators come off the assembly line in Kokomo, Indiana — a great place.\\xa0 They did it in 11 days, from start to finish, a remarkable testament to the ingenuity of the American worker.\\xa0 GM will ship over 600 ventilators this month alone, with thousands more to come.\\xa0 And we have other companies doing something similar.\\n\\nAnd I think they said that there’s a brief clip that we have of General Motors, sent to us by General Motors.\\xa0 And I think they might be wanting to play that for your benefit.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\n(A video is played.)\\n\\nI know you got a little bit nervous when you saw there was a clip about ready to be played, but that was sent to us by General Motors, and we thought it would be a good one to play.\\xa0 It’s amazing.\\xa0 It’s — you know, what they’ve done in a very, very short period of time.\\n\\nThey’re now making thousands of ventilators, and they’re coming out of the factory very rapidly, at a clip that nobody can even believe.\\xa0 But we have others also doing it.\\xa0 And these are very high-grade ventilators.\\xa0 So we’re helping a lot of people.\\xa0 And at this moment, nobody needs them.\\xa0 We have to remember, during the surge, nobody has needed him for weeks now.\\n\\nBut we’ll have them for stockpiles, and very importantly, we’re going to have them for other countries because nobody is able to do things like we can do.\\xa0 And we’re going to be able to help other countries that are having tremendous problems, to put it mildly.\\n\\nMy administration is using every available authority to accelerate the development, study, and delivery of therapies — so important, therapies — treatments, and ultimately, what we want to come up with is a safe vaccine.\\xa0 But frankly, the therapies, to me, are the most important because it takes care of people right now.\\xa0 The vaccines have to be tested, so it takes a longer period of time.\\xa0 But we have some great potential therapies already, and we’ll see how they’re working.\\xa0 We’ll be able to report on that, I think, over the next week or two.\\xa0 Tremendous progress has been made.\\n\\nAt least 35 clinical trials of promising therapies are now underway.\\xa0 So 35 different genius companies.\\xa0 If you look at AIDS, if you look at Ebola, if you look at so many things, they’ve come up with the answers to so many things, you wouldn’t have believed it.\\xa0 And we’re very honored to be working with them.\\n\\nThey include antivirals, and also — and they — something which is incredible: It keeps the virus from multiplying.\\xa0 A mechanism that keeps the virus from multiplying.\\xa0 Immune therapies that prevent the immune system from overreaching to the virus.\\xa0 And convalescent plasma treatments that use antibodies from the blood of recovered patients.\\n\\nAnd we have a lot of patients who recover, and they’re so happy to have recovered that the first thing they do is say, “We want to give our blood.”\\xa0 And they do that.\\xa0 It’s incredible.\\xa0 We have thousands of people that are doing that.\\xa0 They recover and they feel they have an obligation because they’ve gotten such great care.\\xa0 And a lot of them didn’t think they were going to make it.\\n\\nAs the entire U.S. government works to combat the global pandemic, it is absolutely essential that the key positions at relevant federal agencies are fully staffed.\\xa0 And we’re not allowing that to take place through our Congress.\\xa0 They’re just not — they’re just not giving it to us.\\xa0 We have many, many positions that are unstaffed because we can’t get the approvals.\\xa0 The Democrats are holding us up.\\xa0 We cannot get approval.\\n\\nWe’ve gotten judges because we go through the process.\\xa0 I guess we’re up to 448 federal judges.\\xa0 And that, we’ve gotten because we focus on it; we take the maximum time.\\xa0 Because no matter who the judge is, they take vast numbers of days and hours to approve, and it leaves no time left for others.\\xa0 Very unfair system.\\n\\nIf a judge is going to be approved in one hour, in one session, it doesn’t matter — they’ll take the maximum number of hours and days — you’re talking about days — to get one judge approved.\\xa0 And we’re close to 250 judges, but because of the way they’re doing it, there’s no time for anybody else.\\xa0 And many of these people have been waiting for two and a half years.\\xa0 We have a couple that have been waiting for longer than that.\\n\\nThere are currently 129 nominees stuck in the Senate because of partisan obstruction.\\xa0 Many are nominated for vacancies that must be filled to assist with the coronavirus crisis and the resulting economic challenges.\\xa0 And I’ve read, over the last couple of years, “Well, I didn’t fill positions.”\\xa0 I don’t fill positions — in some cases, we don’t need the position, and I’m all for that.\\xa0 But in many cases, you do, but we can’t get them approved by the Democrats.\\xa0 They won’t release them.\\n\\nThe positions include the Director of National Intelligence, two members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Financial Markets of the United States, and the Undersecretary of Agriculture responsible for administering food security programs.\\xa0 And Sonny Perdue, who’s going to be speaking today, is saying, “Please, can I have this man, can I have this particular person approved as soon as possible?”\\xa0 He’s been telling me that for a long time, and the Democrats won’t allow it to happen.\\n\\nAgain, every single judge, every nominee we have goes through maximum, or at least they go through a long process.\\xa0 So it takes days and days, and there’s no time left.\\xa0 And it’s just a concerted effort to make life difficult.\\n\\nAn example is Michael Pack.\\xa0 He’s my nominee for the CEO of the Broadcasking [sic] — Broadcasting Board of Governors.\\xa0 And he’s been stuck in committee for two years, preventing us from managing the Voice of America.\\xa0 Very important.\\n\\nAnd if you heard what’s coming out of the Voice of America, it’s disgusting.\\xa0 What — things they say are disgusting toward our country.\\xa0 And Michael Pack would get in and he’d do a great job, but he’s been waiting now for two years.\\xa0 Can’t get him approved.\\n\\nThe senators left Washington until at least May 4th.\\xa0 The Constitution provides a mechanism for the President to fill positions in such circumstances — the “recess appointment,” it’s called — the Senate’s practice of dabbling into so-called pro forma sessions where no one is even there.\\xa0 It has prevented me from using the constitutional authority that we’re giving — that we’re given under the recess provisions.\\n\\nThe Senate should either fulfill its duty and vote on my nominees or it should formally adjourn so that I can make recess appointments.\\xa0 We have a tremendous number of people that have to come into government — and now more so than ever before, because of the virus and the problem.\\xa0 We have to do it, and we have to do whatever we have to do.\\xa0 They’ve made it very, very difficult to run government.\\xa0 I don’t think any administration has done anywhere near what we’ve done in three and a half years.\\n\\nBut every block — every week, they put up roadblocks, whether it’s “Russia, Russia, Russia,” or whether it’s impeachment hoax, or whatever it may be.\\xa0 It’s always roadblocks and a waste of time.\\n\\nIf the House will not agree to that adjournment, I will exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress.\\xa0 The current practice of leaving town while conducting phony pro forma sessions is a dereliction of duty that the American people cannot afford during this crisis.\\xa0 It is a scam, what they do.\\xa0 It’s a scam, and everybody knows it.\\xa0 And it’s been that way for a long time.\\xa0 And perhaps it’s never done before — it’s never been done before; nobody is even sure if it has.\\xa0 But we’re going to do it.\\xa0 We need these people here.\\xa0 We need people for this crisis, and we don’t want to play any more political games.\\n\\nI’ve been waiting for two and a half years, three years, for some of these people.\\xa0 And they’re great people.\\xa0 They left law firms.\\xa0 They left jobs.\\xa0 They gave up everything to do it.\\xa0 And they’ve been waiting for three years, two and a half years, two years, one year to get approved.\\xa0 It’s ridiculous.\\xa0 And everyone knows they’re going to be approved.\\xa0 But there’s only so many hours in the day, when you go through judges and you go through a lengthy hearings on judges that they know should be approved immediately.\\xa0 And they could do it in one session, one — and they could do it in one hour.\\xa0 And instead, it takes them many days.\\n\\nIn order to advance the health and security of our nation and all nations, as we announced yesterday, the U.S. government has put a hold on funding to the WHO — World Health Organization — pending a review of the organization’s cover-up and mismanagement of the coronavirus outbreak.\\xa0 Over the objections of the WHO, we took decisive action and early lifesaving action to suspend travel from China.\\xa0 They didn’t want to do it.\\xa0 They were angry that we did it.\\xa0 It was early on.\\xa0 They were angry that we did it.\\xa0 Took them a long time to realize what was going on, but I have a feeling they know exactly what was going on.\\n\\nTragically, other nations put their trust in the WHO and they didn’t do any form of ban.\\xa0 And you see what happened to Italy.\\xa0 You see what happened to Spain. \\xa0You see what happened to France.\\xa0 WHO’s guidance had failed to control their borders at a very crucial phase, quickly unleashing the contagion around the world.\\xa0 That was a horrible, tragic mistake — or perhaps they knew.\\xa0 I’m sure they didn’t know the gravity of it, but perhaps they knew.\\xa0 Because if they knew the gravity, that would be an even worse offense.\\n\\nTo ease the economic pain of millions of American families, we’ve now processed $300 billion in loans to more than 1 million small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program.\\xa0 This action has saved millions of American jobs.\\xa0 It’s been an incredible success.\\xa0 And they want to replenish it now, but, again, the Democrats don’t want to do that.\\xa0 This is money that goes to the workers of our country.\\n\\nPhase one was $350 billion dollars.\\xa0 And now phase two, we want to do $250 billion.\\xa0 This goes to workers and it goes to small businesses so we can save all the small businesses around our nation.\\n\\nMike McFarland from Nebraska recently said this historic relief has been a godsend for his small factory, and the 136 Americans who work there.\\xa0 He saved those jobs.\\xa0 Another small business owner, Tim Miller from Oklahoma, called the program a total lifesaver for his auto-repair shop’s four employees.\\xa0 Stories like these underscore why Congress must replenish the Paycheck Protection Program immediately.\\xa0 The Republicans want to do it; they want to do it immediately.\\xa0 They want to do it now.\\xa0 And the Democrats are stopping it.\\n\\nA short time ago, CDC issued public health guidelines for critical industries.\\xa0 In a few moments, Agricultural Secretary Sonny Perdue will elaborate on how these guidelines apply to our nation’s dedicated workers in the food processing profession — because it’s a profession.\\xa0 It’s incredible what they do: food processing.\\xa0 And they’re keeping our grocery stores full.\\xa0 The shelves are not bare like the shelves that I inherited when we took over the stockpile — the medical stockpile, where the shelves were bare.\\xa0 “The cupboard was bare,” I say.\\n\\nTomorrow, I’ll also be leading a call with elected officials who will consult with my administration as we work to restore our economy to full speed.\\xa0 And we really think, with all of the stimulus and all of the pent-up demand, we’re going to have an economy that really comes back quickly.\\xa0 And we’d like to see it more than match what we had before.\\xa0 What we had before was a miracle.\\xa0 And we think this is going to be even more than a miracle.\\xa0 We’re going to do it because we have the greatest people in the world.\\n\\nWe’ll also be speaking to America’s governors tomorrow and then we’ll be announcing exactly what’s happening.\\xa0 You already know we’ll be opening up states — some states much sooner than others.\\xa0 And we think some of the states can actually open up before the deadline of May 1st.\\xa0 And I think that that will be a very exciting time indeed.\\n\\nGovernors are looking forward — they’re chomping at the bit to get going.\\xa0 Again, not all states are the same.\\xa0 They’re very different.\\xa0 Some are having very little problems.\\xa0 Some have done such a good job that they have very little problem and they’re ready to go.\\xa0 So, Vice President Pence and I will be speaking with the governors tomorrow.\\xa0 We’ll be discussing procedures.\\n\\nToday, I spoke with the leaders of many of our nation’s most renowned companies and organizations on how to achieve the full resurgence of the American economy.\\xa0 My discussions included top leaders in health and healthcare, transportation technology, financial services, food, beverages, hospitality, real estate, retail, agriculture, construction, energy, labor, manufacturing, and sports industries.\\n\\nWe want to get our country open again.\\xa0 We want to have our sports leagues open.\\xa0 You want to watch sports.\\xa0 It’s important.\\xa0 We miss sports.\\xa0 We miss everything.\\xa0 We want to get back.\\n\\nThese experts and innovators provided extremely productive feedback on how to safely reboot our economy.\\xa0 They gave us a lot of great ideas.\\xa0 We spoke to a lot of very, very smart people — the highest of the high-tech.\\xa0 The level of IQ on some of those calls was about the highest you’ve ever seen on a phone call, that I can tell you.\\n\\nBut we have a lot of great thought went into those calls, and a lot of questions came out and also statements — very strong statements, as to what they recommend.\\xa0 It was — I think it was a great day.\\xa0 We did a lot of — a lot of calling with a lot of very prominent people — but, more importantly, very smart people and people that love our country.\\n\\nThey talked about the vital importance of our wide array of relief measures to address the present crisis, and they provided valuable insights on how to move forward, including on the role of protective gear, where we have tremendous amounts of protective gear coming in; robust testing; and the future use of therapies and treatments.\\n\\nThey also underscored the crucial importance of strong supply chains and communications infrastructure.\\xa0 We’re talking about infrastructure for the middle of our country.\\xa0 We’re talking about broadband and things that they, frankly, don’t have and haven’t had for a long time because a lot of politicians forgot about them.\\xa0 You can’t forget about them.\\xa0 They’re really the heart and soul.\\xa0 You can’t forget about them.\\n\\nAnd we’re talking about the telemedical.\\xa0 It’s a new thing, and it’s incredible what they’ve been able to do.\\xa0 This is an industry that’s just growing, but it’s take — it’s grown by leaps and bounds over the last five weeks.\\xa0 People are learning so much.\\xa0 Without the ability to see a doctor, they’re learning so much and a lot of good things are happening.\\xa0 That’s something that’s really, going forward, I think, going to be very important for our country.\\n\\nAs we’ve seen throughout our proud history, America is never greater than when our people are working in unison toward a common goal.\\xa0 That’s what’s happening right now.\\xa0 We’ll go ahead.\\xa0 We’ll forge an even brighter future today than we had.\\xa0 And we’ll be — along with other nations, hopefully; we’re working with other nations — we’ll be the comeback kids.\\xa0 All of us.\\xa0 All of us.\\n\\nIt’s incredible what’s going on.\\xa0 I’m very proud of the people of this country.\\xa0 I’m very proud of the people I spoke to today.\\xa0 These are truly great, brilliant people, and we’ve gained tremendous insight.\\n\\nSo tomorrow is going to be a very big day.\\xa0 We’re going to be speaking with the governors.\\xa0 We’ll have some information on some openings.\\xa0 And again, we’ll have some openings that will be — will exceed our expectations.\\xa0 And they’ll be safe, they’ll be strong, but we want to get our country back.\\xa0 We want to get our country back.\\xa0 And we’re going to do it and we’re going to do it soon.\\n\\nWith that, I’d like to ask Dr. Birx to come up and say a few words, and then Secretary Sonny Perdue, and then Vice President Pence.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 And thank you for summarizing the states and what we’re seeing.\\xa0 So, over the last five to six days, we’ve seen declines in cases across the country and this has been very reassuring for us.\\n\\nAt the same time, we know that mortality and the fatalities that we’re facing across the United States continue.\\xa0 We know the number of people who are still in the hospitals in the ICUs, and we want to continue to recognize the healthcare workers who are on the frontlines, and really recognize how low the United States case fatality rates are, compared to other countries.\\xa0 And this is really due not only to our technology, but how that technology is utilized to save lives.\\n\\nAt the same time, I’m inspired by the American people who continue social distancing.\\xa0 These cases continue to decline because of the strong work of the American people.\\n\\nI also wanted to let you know that we do have nine states that have less than 1,000 cases and less than 30 new cases per day.\\xa0 So we’re looking at states and metro areas as individual — individual areas.\\n\\nWe talked before how each of these curves are different.\\xa0 Each of the case’s experiences are different.\\xa0 We have some states — like California and Washington State, Oregon — that never really had a peak because of so much work that their populations did to decrease and keep the new cases down.\\xa0 So each of these individual states and individual metros are being studied very specifically.\\n\\nI do want to highlight — and we are remaining concerned and we’ve been having discussions with Rhode Island.\\xa0 Rhode Island and Providence are in a unique situation.\\xa0 First, they had increasing cases from the New York City area, and now they have new increasing cases from the Boston area.\\xa0 They are caught between two incredible hotspots in the country.\\xa0 They’re doing an extraordinary job.\\xa0 They’re caring for the individuals on the frontlines, but Providence continues to have new cases.\\n\\nAnd we do continue to work with specific states that have specific outbreaks related to individual occurrences.\\xa0 I will just remind the American people again: This is a highly contagious virus.\\xa0 Social gatherings, coming together is — there’s always a chance that a asymptomatic person can spread the virus unknowingly.\\xa0 No one is intending to spread the virus.\\xa0 We know if you are sick, you will stay home.\\xa0 But to all of you that are out there that would like to join together and just have that dinner party for 20: Don’t do it yet.\\xa0 Continue to follow the presidential guidelines.\\n\\nWe really appreciate the work of the American people.\\xa0 We see, as a country, we’re improving.\\xa0 We see, as metro areas, we’re improving.\\xa0 We see, as communities, as counties, and as states, we’re improving, but that also still requires everyone to continue to social distance.\\n\\nAnd in the end, we do have states that have very few cases and very few new cases.\\xa0 And so, these are the ones the President is referring to that have been silent — relatively silent — throughout this epidemic and pandemic that many of us have faced.\\xa0 And so, these are the groups we are working with very specifically.\\xa0 And each of these governors and each of these mayors will have to make decisions, after generalized guidelines are put out, so that they can do what’s best for their communities.\\xa0 They are at the frontline.\\n\\nAnd I wanted to conclude by really thanking my PEPFAR teams around the world who have been working tirelessly throughout the world to ensure that Africa and Asia doesn’t experience this level of infections that we have seen here.\\xa0 They’ve turned over their capacities from their embassies.\\xa0 Our U.S. hires throughout the world, our ambassadors are still on the frontline with our local staff, working with ministries of health, to confront this virus around the globe.\\xa0 And I assure you that they are continuing to invest in the health structures, the laboratory, and the frontline care to ensure that all of the work that we have done against TB, HIV, and malaria continues.\\xa0 But that we use our capacity, our laboratories, our clinics, our hospitals that have been built by the American people and the generosity of the American people to really combat this COVID-19 around the globe.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Thank you, Doctor.\\n\\nSonny, please.\\n\\nSECRETARY PERDUE:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to be here with you today and to — I want you to know it’s an honor to represent you in leading the Department of Agriculture and represent the constituency who are crucial in maintaining our nation’s food security, enabling us to keep food on the table of our American families — not only just food, but wholesome and safe food as well.\\n\\nI’d like to start my remarks today by echoing what my colleagues at the CDC have been saying regarding the health and safety of our essential employees across the United States.\\xa0 CDC has provided strategies there that aimed at helping our most critical workers, both in healthcare and food processing, to quickly and safely return to work after potential exposure to COVID-19, provided those workers are symptom-free.\\xa0 And this guidance will help these critical industries in the food sector provide — to protect the health and safety of essential workers, while keeping critical functions working throughout the COVID-19 response.\\n\\nAs we know, any employee who develops symptoms while on the job should go home immediately.\\xa0 And the interim guidance is in line with CDC recommendations for healthcare workers, caring for those sick with COVID-19.\\n\\nSo we appreciate the dedication and commitment of all the brave men and working — women working to keep their communities fed.\\xa0 And we will continue to work with the CDC to keep those individuals as safe as possible during these challenging times.\\n\\nIn that vein, there’s been a lot happening this week, as COVID-19 is impacting food-processing facilities, as you know.\\xa0 For Americans who be — may be worried about access to good food because of this, I want to assure you: The American food supply is strong, resilient, and safe.\\xa0 And in fact, our food supply chain has shown tremendous agility in shifting production and logistics so suddenly from restaurant and institutional settings to retail settings.\\n\\nTo all the employers out there in this sector: It’s critical that you follow CDC guidelines and guidance and best practices to keep all of your employees and people safe and healthy.\\n\\nTo employees and local public health officials advising them: The CDC has issued guidelines on how to mitigate a situation if you have a positive case in one of your facilities.\\xa0 We need our local health authorities and our state health authorities to do everything they can to balance the demand of keeping our facilities operational and our critical industries going, while at the same time keeping the health and safety of employees as a top priority, as well as our communities.\\n\\nSo I want to also take this time to thank all of our critical, essential food supply chain workers.\\xa0 The entire country is counting on these patriotic individuals, by doing the work in our food supply chain.\\xa0 These dedicated workers include, obviously, farmers and producers, but also processers, truckers, and grocery store workers, as you know.\\n\\nAmerica is depending on what you have — the food we need to feed our families — and you’re the ones who are making that happen.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nAs an entire nation, we’re truly thankful for the work you’re doing, and we recognize that you are the true patriotic heroes during this national emergency, along with our healthcare workers.\\n\\nSo, before I sign off here, Mr. President, I want to remind you and all of us of one more thing: In the United States, we have plenty of food for all of our citizens.\\xa0 I want to be clear: The bare store shelves that you may see in some cities in the country are a demand issue, not a supply issue.\\xa0 The way food is prepared and packaged to be sold in a restaurant or a school is significantly different than the way it’s packaged for you to buy in the grocery store.\\xa0 Our supply chain is sophisticated, efficient, integrated, and synchronized, and it’s taken us a few days to relocate the misalignment between institutional settings and grocery settings.\\xa0 But that does not mean that we don’t have enough food in this country to feed the American people.\\n\\nYou might think of it as an interstate when it’s flowing in along well, and you have a crash in one place — it backs up.\\xa0 And that’s what’s happening in the food supply chain.\\xa0 But we’re working through that.\\n\\nAnd all this — through all this, our food supply chain has proven to be very resilient, just like American people.\\xa0 To the extent we have challenges, we have and continue to — to work through it all together.\\xa0 And we can and we will get through this with a whole-of-America approach, Mr. President — the critical partnership between state and local health officials, management of companies, and the employees.\\xa0 And we will meet any challenges we face by working together.\\n\\nThank you, sir, for the opportunity.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 And before the Vice President comes up, I just wanted to say, speaking of Sonny, China has paid us billions of dollars — many, many billions of dollars — in tariffs, which we’ve distributed — some to the farmers, because they were targeted.\\xa0 We have many billions of dollars being held by Sonny.\\xa0 And I’ve told him to distribute much of that money to the farmers.\\n\\nOur farmers were targeted and now they’re benefiting by the amount that they were targeted.\\xa0 And we are very honored to do that.\\xa0 And, Sonny, you’re going to start that process very soon.\\xa0 You’ll let the farmers know.\\xa0 Nobody can take advantage of our farmers.\\n\\nSo we have a lot of money that we’ve taken in from China.\\xa0 We’re going to be distributing that money from — from Sonny to the farmers.\\xa0 And there is tremendous money over and above that.\\xa0 That money was paid directly into the Treasury of the United States.\\n\\nThis has never happened to China before.\\xa0 They never gave us 10 cents.\\xa0 Now they’re paying us billions of dollars and we appreciate it.\\n\\nSo thank you very much, Sonny.\\xa0 Great job.\\n\\nPlease.\\xa0 Mike, please.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today.\\xa0 It was reported to us that we’ve conducted and completed 3,324,000 tests across the nation.\\xa0 More than 619,000 Americans have tested positive.\\xa0 But as you reflected yesterday when we welcomed coronavirus survivors here to the White House from across the country, some more than 45,000 Americans have fully recovered.\\n\\nSadly, we mourn the loss of more than 27,000 of our — our countrymen.\\xa0 Our hearts are with their families and with the families of all of those that continue to struggle with the serious consequences of this illness.\\xa0 But as Dr. Birx just reflected, despite the heartbreaking losses, we’re getting there, America.\\n\\nBecause of the efforts of people all across this country to put into practice the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines, because of their adherence to the direction of state and local authorities, as Dr. Birx just reflected, we — we see great signs of progress from the West Coast to the East Coast.\\n\\nPresident Trump has directed our team to develop new guidelines that will be presented tomorrow to our nation’s governors and — and released to the American people thereafter.\\n\\nThe American people will be encouraged to know that, as we stand here today, 24 percent of the counties of this country have no reported coronavirus cases.\\xa0 In fact, half of the states in America have less than 2,500 cases per state.\\xa0 This is a great tribute to the efforts by the people of those communities.\\n\\nBut as the President suggested, when we unveil the guidelines that the team has been working to present tomorrow to our nation’s governors, we’re going to reflect on the fact that, as the President said, there will be areas of the country that will require continued mitigation and strong efforts.\\xa0 And there will be other areas of the country that will be — be given guidance for greater flexibility, and the President has so directed our team.\\n\\nWhen we think of more than 619,000 Americans having tested positive, more than 45,000 having recovered, we wanted to announce today that the FDA recently announced efforts to facilitate the development and access to convalescent plasma, Mr. President.\\xa0 You’ve spoken about this.\\xa0 People who have recovered from the coronavirus have antibodies in your bloodstream that can attack the virus.\\n\\nThe Mayo Clinic today is working with the Red Cross to make sure that coronavirus patients have access to the convalescent plasma treatments, and over 1,000 institutions across America have already joined this program.\\n\\nAnd we want to urge every American who has recovered from the coronavirus for at least two — and preferably four weeks, to contact your local blood or plasma donation center and arrange to donate.\\xa0 It’s one more way that the American people can do their part and step forward.\\xa0 And thousands have already done so, and we know that tens of thousands will join them.\\n\\nOn the subject of supplies — Mr. President, I’ll be very brief because you detailed a great amount.\\xa0 As the President mentioned, the air bridge has completed 44 flights.\\xa0 Fifty-six more are scheduled.\\n\\nBut on the subject of facial masks, which are so important for the protection of critical infrastructure, I’m pleased to report that the average daily delivery through the commercial network through our air bridge is 22 million facial masks coming into the marketplace.\\xa0 The average inventory in the network over a seven-day period is 80 million masks.\\xa0 And FEMA is actually working, as we speak, to move facial masks to priority infrastructure: food supply, first responders.\\xa0 There’ll be 6.5 million masks that go out before the end of this week, an additional 20 million before April the 20th, and then we’ll be adding 6.5 million each and every week.\\n\\nAt that the President’s direction, we’re going to ensure that all of those that work in food supply, all of those first responders have access to masks.\\xa0 And we’re increasing those every day.\\n\\nFinally, I know I speak for the President when I say how proud we are of all of our healthcare workers across the country, and how proud we are of the men and women in uniform — our medical professionals who have been deployed across the nation, literally by the thousands.\\n\\nIn fact, as we stand here today, 576 doctors, nurses, and other military medical professionals have been deployed to 13 hospitals across the nation: 10 in New York, and 1 in Connecticut, Texas, and Louisiana each.\\n\\nAnd, as the President reflected a few days ago, because we did not have the — happily, did not have the demand on the Javits Center and on the Comfort in New York City, at the President’s direction, we have deployed doctors and nurses from those two facilities to hospitals.\\xa0 In fact, the President and I were just speaking to Mayor de Blasio just before we came out, and he expressed his great admiration and appreciation for the relief that these medical military personnel have provided to incredibly dedicated people in our hospitals.\\xa0 Two hundred and fifty-eight medical personnel just yesterday were deployed off the ship and out of the Javits Center into New York.\\n\\nWith that, Mr. President, I’ll step aside.\\xa0 But it’s remarkable to think of all that we’ve accomplished over the last month since you first issued the Presidential Guidelines for America.\\n\\nThe truth is, because of what the American people have done over the last 30 days, we are slowing the spread.\\xa0 We are ensuring that every American family would have access to the healthcare that we’d want any member of our family to have — with the greatest healthcare professionals in the world.\\xa0 We’re saving lives and we’re healing our land.\\n\\nAnd so we want to thank the American people for all you have done.\\xa0 And tomorrow, we’ll be presenting a new guidance to the governors of this country about how we build on our progress and reopen America in a safe and responsible way.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mike.\\xa0 Great.\\xa0 Thank you, Mike.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 On the recess appointments, Mr. President, if I could.\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Steve, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You’ve mentioned the possibility of adjourning both the chambers of Congress.\\xa0 Can you explain what you meant by that, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Very simple: If they don’t act on getting these people approved that we need because of the — we need them anyway, but we especially need now because of the pandemic — we are going to do something that will be something I’d prefer not doing, but which I should do and I will do if I have to.\\n\\nKaitlan, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I have two questions for you.\\xa0 One, on a call with business leaders today, they said testing has got to be ramped up significantly before the country — before they feel comfortable reopening their stores —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — their restaurants, and what-not.\\xa0 Isn’t that what health officials and state governors have been telling you?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s what I want too.\\xa0 And we have great tests.\\xa0 And we want the states to administer these tests, for the most part.\\xa0 But we’re standing behind them.\\xa0 We have great tests.\\xa0 We’ve done more testing now than any country, as you know, in the world, by far.\\n\\nWe have the best tests of any country in the world.\\xa0 Nobody have — has the quality of tests, the — if you look at Abbott, what they’ve come up with in a short period of time.\\xa0 They’ve been incredible.\\xa0 Roche has been incredible.\\xa0 We have the best tests in the world.\\n\\nAnd we will be working very much with the governors of the states.\\xa0 We want them to do it.\\xa0 We’re not going to be running a parking lot in Arkansas.\\xa0 We’re not going to be running a parking lot, where you have a Walmart — which has been great, by the way; Walmart has done a fantastic job — but where you have a testing center and running that from Washington, D.C.\\xa0 The states are much better equipped to do it.\\n\\nBut we’ll be working with the states.\\xa0 We’re standing behind the states.\\xa0 We’re going to work very closely with the governors, in terms of that — getting additional equipment.\\xa0 It used to be three, four weeks ago — two weeks ago, “Can we get more ventilators?”\\xa0 More ventilators, right?\\xa0 And we got them ventilators, and you don’t hear that anymore.\\xa0 It’s been pretty amazing, what we’ve been able to do.\\n\\nYeah.\\xa0 Go ahead, Jon.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You talked about Walmart —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A lot of the equipment (inaudible), a lot of those testing centers are still for first responders and healthcare workers who have symptoms only.\\xa0 When is it going to be widespread enough to where these companies can feel comfortable being open?\\xa0 Will that happen in two weeks?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think the companies will determine that, and the governors will determine that, and the federal government will de- — and if we’re not happy, we’ll take very strong action against a state or a governor.\\xa0 If we’re not happy with the job a governor is doing, we’ll let them know about it.\\xa0 And, as you know, we have very strong action we can take, including a closedown, but we don’t want to do that.\\n\\nWe’re working with the governors and we’re working closely with the governors.\\xa0 The relationship has been very good.\\xa0 The Vice President has had a lot of conversations over the last two weeks with either 50 or almost 50 governors on every conversation.\\xa0 And they’ve been really positive conversations.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible) close down?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we have the right to do whatever we want.\\xa0 But we wouldn’t do that.\\xa0 But, no, we would have the right to close down what they’re doing if we want to do that.\\xa0 But we don’t want to do that —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible) what the states are doing?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — and I don’t think there’ll be any reason to do that, but we have the right to do that.\\n\\nSteve?\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You got me already.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr.\\xa0 President, why did you have your name added to these coronavirus relief checks?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I don’t know too much about it, but I understand my name is there.\\xa0 I don’t know where they’re going, how they’re going.\\xa0 I do understand it’s not delaying anything.\\xa0 And I’m satisfied with that.\\xa0 I don’t — I don’t imagine it’s a big deal.\\xa0 I’m sure people will be very happy to get a big, fat, beautiful check and my name is on it.\\n\\nYeah.\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President — Mr. President —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, previous Presidents never did this.\\xa0 Why — why are you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Dr. Birx just said that Rhode Island is seeing an increase in cases from people that are coming from Boston and New York.\\xa0 You just said you’d like to reopen some states before May 1.\\xa0 How will you stop a second spike in cases if people are traveling between states?\\xa0 How will you control the flow of people traveling over —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, the governors can control that flow, as an example.\\xa0 In fact, I just saw, a little while ago, it was reported that certain borders are being controlled already by states.\\xa0 They’re starting to take control of their borders, which is good.\\xa0 So they’ll be controlling.\\xa0 They may do testing for people wanting to come in; I’d read that about Rhode Island.\\xa0 So they have to watch it.\\xa0 They have to be very careful.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\xa0 In the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President. \\xa0About reopening the country again, you said, “along with other nations.”\\xa0 What form would it take?\\xa0 Are you considering, also, relaxing the border between Canada and the U.S.?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So our relationship with Canada is very good.\\xa0 We’ll talk about that.\\xa0 It will be one of the early borders to be released.\\xa0 Canada is doing well.\\xa0 We’re doing well.\\xa0 We’ll see.\\xa0 But at some point, we’ll be doing that.\\n\\nIn the meantime, nations that are heavily infected — we have a lot of nations that are heavily infected.\\xa0 Some are getting better.\\xa0 Some are still on the way up, unfortunately.\\xa0 We’re keeping very strong borders with those nations.\\xa0 But with Canada, we are talking about different things.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you said the — the evidence suggests that nationwide we have passed the peak on new cases.\\xa0 What’s your evidence for that?\\xa0 What are the numbers saying?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, all we’re doing is looking at the numbers, we’re looking at our graphs, we’re looking at our models.\\xa0 We’re getting a great response from Deborah and from Tony and from many of the professionals that are working.\\xa0 We have great professionals working with us.\\xa0 And, I think, based on that, we’re — we’re doing very well.\\n\\nBased on that, it looks like we’re headed absolutely in the right direction.\\xa0 But some states are looking at other states, and they’re saying, “I can’t imagine what they’re going through” — because they’re not in that position.\\xa0 They’re in very good shape.\\n\\nI would say that we have 20 states, at least, but you really have 29 that are in extremely good shape.\\xa0 You have others that are getting much better.\\xa0 And I think, with almost a few exceptions, you have every state that is either doing better or on the way to doing better.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On your threat to adjourn or — adjourn Congress, on — clearly, you have the power: Article Two, Section Three.\\xa0 But that would be quite radical to do.\\n\\nEarlier last month, you were in the Oval Office, talking about, “Now is not the time for partisanship.”\\xa0 How will that act lower the partisanship in this town?\\xa0 And could it potentially hinder your ability to get something done on coronavirus?\\xa0 And then —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it is — it’s — look, it’s been a very partisan government for a long period of time, not just this administration.\\xa0 You can go back into the last two administrations; you’ve seen a lot of partisanship.\\xa0 And even now, you would think that we wouldn’t have.\\n\\nAs an example, with the Paycheck Plan, that’s going so well.\\xa0 It’s so smooth, so beautiful, almost without a hitch.\\xa0 All of that money is being distributed to small businesses.\\xa0 They’re giving it to their employees.\\xa0 It’s keeping them ready, viable.\\xa0 So when we open — and now, it’s been so good that it’s almost depleted and we want to replenish it, and we can’t get the Democrats to approve it.\\xa0 And that’s a program that they and everybody else admit that are great.\\n\\nSo, you do have partisanship.\\xa0 We have been trying for years to get people approved for positions.\\xa0 People have left — one man left a law firm.\\xa0 One man left a — a big chain.\\xa0 He was a very successful executive; he left.\\xa0 It was two years ago.\\xa0 We have people that have been waiting for three years.\\xa0 And we can’t get them approved by the Democrats in the Senate because they’re taking so long to approve our judges.\\n\\nNow, I have to tell you that I’m totally in favor of what Mitch is doing with judges, because that’s — always seems to be a priority and it’s a very important priority.\\xa0 I think it’s one of the great trademarks of this administration: We’ve approved record numbers of federal judges and appellate judges and two Supreme Court judges.\\n\\nBut rather than approving somebody who’s highly qualified — somebody that everybody knows is going to be approved — rather than going quickly, they take the maximum amount of time, whatever that time may be.\\xa0 And what they’re doing by doing that is taking days to approve somebody that could be approved in a quick vote.\\xa0 People that get phenomenal reviews in committee are going maximum number of hours.\\xa0 And what they do is — there’s only so many hours in a day.\\n\\nNow, we could have said, “Let’s stay.”\\xa0 I would have been in favor of that.\\xa0 They didn’t choose to do it.\\xa0 But I have a very strong power.\\xa0 I’d rather not use that power, but we have way over 100 people that we very badly need in this administration that should have been approved a long time ago.\\xa0 And one of them is the head of Voice of America.\\xa0 If you look at what they’re doing and what they’re saying about our country, it’s a disgrace — the people that are running that.\\xa0 We have somebody that’s really good, really talented, and that loves our country.\\xa0 And I want to get these people approved.\\n\\nThat’s one of many.\\xa0 We have professionals.\\xa0 Sonny, you’ve been waiting for — how long have you been waiting for the man that we’re talking about coming in?\\n\\nSECRETARY PERDUE:\\xa0 Two and a half years.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Two and a half years.\\xa0 So Sonny Perdue just happens to be here talking about something else.\\xa0 So you’ve been waiting for one of the most important position, as Secretary of Agriculture, is the position — it’s distribution.\\xa0 We need it now.\\xa0 We’re talking about shelves.\\xa0 We’re talking about cupboards.\\xa0 He needs it.\\xa0 He’s been waiting — he didn’t know he was going to get this question.\\xa0 You’ve been waiting two and a half years.\\n\\nThe person is exceptional.\\xa0 That person left a very good job.\\xa0 And it’s embarrassing to me.\\xa0 He’ll say, “Do you think you’ll get that man approved?”\\xa0 He’s been saying that to me for a long time.\\xa0 It’s because of the Democrats.\\n\\nAnd what we’re doing is — and I think anybody here would do it — judges are a priority.\\xa0 A federal judge is going to sit for 50 years, potentially — a young judge.\\xa0 Going to be sitting for — that’s always going to have to be a priority.\\n\\nBut because they’re taking so much time and approving every — they’re trying to put us through the mill.\\xa0 That’s — when you talk about partisanship — and it’s never ever happened before.\\xa0 You can look at every administration in the history of this country.\\xa0 Nobody — nobody has ever had hundreds of people not approved after three and a half years.\\n\\nGo ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What’s the timeline for that though?\\xa0 If Congress doesn’t act by — when?\\xa0 Do you have a date?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’ll know soon.\\xa0 Look, they know.\\xa0 I — they’ve been warned and they’re being warned right now.\\xa0 If they don’t approve it, then we’re going to go this route.\\xa0 And we’ll probably be challenged in court, and we’ll see who wins.\\n\\nBut when the court hears that we aren’t getting people approved — as Sonny would say, for two and a half years — for an important position that we need because of this crisis — we needed these people before, but now we really need these people.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, when you talk about — back to the numbers for a second.\\xa0 When you talk about the numbers — the jobless claims are going to come out tomorrow.\\xa0 It’s likely around 5 million more Americans putting their names in for unemployment benefits.\\xa0 But yet, there are still a couple thousand people, as well, dying a day because of coronavirus.\\n\\nWhen you talk about opening up the American economy — or at least in parts — now, how do you balance that decision out, given both of those figures?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we are.\\xa0 There has to be a balance.\\xa0 You know, there’s also death involved in keeping it closed.\\xa0 And I’ve gone over this with you, and I believe this so strongly.\\xa0 When you look at mental health, when you look at suicides; suicide hotlines, which are exploding; people losing their jobs.\\xa0 When you look at drugs, and people that didn’t take drugs and now they’re becoming drug addicted because they’re going through a problem.\\xa0 They have no job.\\xa0 They have no money coming in — other than the money we’re getting them.\\xa0 We’ve opened up the coffers to a large extent.\\xa0 We’re helping people.\\n\\nThis is why I wish the Democrats would help us a little bit with it, because they should.\\xa0 It’s purely partisan what they’re doing, and it’s bad for our country.\\xa0 But — but, you know, there is death by doing — by having this strongly closed country.\\xa0 We have to get back to work.\\n\\nWith all of that being said, we’re going to start with states and with governors that have done a great job.\\xa0 And they’re going to open it up as they see fit.\\xa0 And we’re going to be right behind them.\\xa0 And we’re — we’re going to be working.\\xa0 We’re going to be supplying them with things if they don’t have them.\\xa0 We want them to have them.\\n\\nWe’re going to be helping them with ventilators after this is over so that they can’t say, “Oh, the federal government…”\\xa0 We want them to have — they’ve had a lot of options.\\xa0 Many of the governors have had a lot of options, over the years, to buy ventilators.\\xa0 They didn’t choose to do it.\\xa0 So we’re going to be helping them to fill up their stockpiles.\\xa0 We’re going to have plenty.\\xa0 And as I said, I’m very proud to do it.\\n\\nWe’re going to be helping other nations.\\xa0 We’re going to be helping Italy, Spain, France, other nations.\\xa0 And we’re going to be helping them strongly.\\xa0 I think Russia is going to need ventilators.\\xa0 They’re having a hard time in Moscow.\\xa0 We’re going to help them.\\xa0 We’re going to help other countries that need ventilators.\\n\\nWe’re going to have a lot.\\xa0 You see it with General Motors.\\xa0 You see it with other companies that are producing.\\xa0 We’re going to have hundreds of thousands of ventilators.\\xa0 And it’s a great thing to have.\\n\\nYes, in the back.\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 Is anybody freezing?\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 You know, it’s very cold out here.\\xa0 So we can leave early, right?\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\n\\nOkay, a couple more.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Why do we have 20 percent of the world’s deaths from the coronavirus when we’re only 4 percent of the world’s population?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, you don’t know what you have.\\xa0 Do you think you’re getting honest numbers from some of these countries?\\xa0 Do you really believe those numbers in this vast country called China — and that they have a certain number of cases and a certain number of deaths — does anybody really believe that?\\n\\nHere’s the story: We report everything.\\xa0 We’re reporting the cases, and our reporting is good.\\xa0 We’re reporting every death. In fact, I see, this morning, where New York added 3,000 deaths because they died.\\xa0 And they’re now saying — rather than, “It was a heart attack” — they’re saying, “It was a heart attack caused by this.”\\xa0 So they’re adding.\\xa0 If you look at it, that’s it.\\n\\nAnd everything we have is documented, reported.\\xa0 And what they are doing is, just in case, they’re calling it this.\\xa0 And that’s okay.\\xa0 That’s okay.\\xa0 But we are — we have more cases because we do more reporting.\\xa0 We have more cases because everything is down.\\n\\nBut does anybody really believe the numbers of some of these countries that you’ve been watching and you’ve been reporting on?\\xa0 And then, it’s like they didn’t have the big thing.\\xa0 They have been some really, really bad — heavily — and really, some countries that are in big, big trouble.\\xa0 And they’re not reporting the facts.\\xa0 And that’s up to them.\\n\\nAll I know is: We report the facts, and we’re a country that’s getting better.\\n\\nJohn, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, multiple sources are telling Fox News today that the United States government now has high confidence that, while the coronavirus is a naturally occurring virus, it emanated from a virology lab in Wuhan.\\xa0 That, because of lax safety protocols, an intern was infected, who later infected her boyfriend, and then went to the wet market in Wuhan where it began to spread.\\xa0 Does that correspond with what you have heard from officials?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I don’t want to say that, John.\\xa0 But I will tell you, more and more, we’re hearing the story.\\xa0 And we’ll see.\\xa0 When you say “multiple sources” — now there’s a case where you can use the word “sources” — but we are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation that happened.\\n\\nGo ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 In your many conversations with President Xi, Mr. President, did you ever discuss with him State Department concerns about lax safety protocols that had been reported to the State Department from the embassy in Beijing about that laboratory?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t want to discuss what I talked to him about the laboratory.\\xa0 I just don’t want to discuss it.\\xa0 It’s inappropriate right now.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead, in the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Tim Arvier from Channel 9 Australia.\\xa0 There have been calls in our country for Prime Minister Scott Morrison to make funding for WHO conditional on reforms to the organization. I wanted to get your thoughts on that, and if you had any advice for Mr. Morrison.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Look, I feel very badly about the World Health Organization, but it’s been a tool of China.\\xa0 It’s been, as I say, totally China-centric.\\xa0 You take a look at everything that’s happened; they’ve been wrong.\\xa0 I was all for it at the beginning.\\xa0 What do I know?\\xa0 I walked in, I said, “World Health Organization — isn’t that wonderful?”\\xa0 And then you start to see all the mistakes.\\xa0 They didn’t want us to close our borders to China — to Wuhan, specifically.\\xa0 They didn’t want our borders closed.\\n\\nYou take a look — Mike was there; we were all there — and they’re criticizing me for closing the border.\\xa0 I did that very early.\\xa0 By the way, I did that very early, while Nancy Pelosi was trying to have, in San Francisco, parties in Chinatown.\\xa0 Because they — she thought it would be great.\\xa0 She wanted to show that this thing doesn’t exist.\\xa0 These are people — I’ll tell you, we have some politicians on the other side that don’t know what they’re doing.\\n\\nIf you look at — if you look at timelines — you’ve got to look at some timelines.\\xa0 But the World — the World Health Organization, just like the World Trade Organization — I’m telling you — I call them — they have been treating the United States, for decades, so badly.\\xa0 And they’ve been so in favor of China.\\n\\nChina took off when it joined the World Trade Organization because of what’s happened.\\xa0 Think of it: They’re considered a developing nation.\\xa0 And because they’re a dev- — and we’re not.\\xa0 But we’re a developing nation too, in my book.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 We’re developing too.\\n\\nBut the fact is: We have been treated so badly by these organizations.\\xa0 And, believe me, I’m looking at that one too.\\xa0 We’re winning a lot of lawsuits right now that we never won before in the past.\\xa0 We’re winning a lot of money that we never won in the past.\\xa0 That’s with the World Trade.\\xa0 But with the World Health Organization — what’s happened there is a disgrace.\\n\\nHere’s the other thing: We pay $400- to $500 million a year.\\xa0 China is paying $38-, $39-, and $40 million a year.\\xa0 And it’s like they control this group.\\xa0 I could do that too, if I want to devote full time to it.\\xa0 I have some very capable people dealing with Dr. Tedros.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 I could do it too.\\xa0 I could do very well with that.\\xa0 But there’s something going on.\\xa0 There’s something going on that is very bad.\\n\\nNow, the $500 million that we save, we’ll determine — we’re going to make a determination over a little period of time.\\xa0 But they’re going to either have to make massive changes — I don’t even know if they’re going to be able to do that — or we’re going to give money to people.\\xa0 We want to help people.\\xa0 You know, what we do in Africa with AIDS — people have no idea what we do and the money we spent.\\xa0 We were talking about it the other day, Doctor.\\n\\nWe are spending billions of dollars to help people.\\xa0 In the case of one that Dr. Birx is very much involved in, AIDS — billions of dollars.\\xa0 And you know what?\\xa0 It’s a great thing.\\xa0 Nobody talks about it.\\xa0 Nobody gives us credit.\\xa0 We do that, and we do it very directly.\\n\\nBut we’re spending billions of dollars to help people live and — all over the world.\\xa0 But we’re spending $500 million to the World Health Organization, and there’s something very bad going on.\\xa0 And you know what?\\xa0 I’ve gotten very much involved. It’s been going on for a long period of time, and we don’t want to be the suckers anymore.\\n\\nSo, it’s cold out.\\xa0 We will talk to you tomorrow.\\xa0 A big day tomorrow.\\xa0 Very big day.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nEND\\n\\n6:47 P.M.

       "  'text': 'James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\\n\\nApril 13, 2020\\n5:49 P.M. EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much, everyone.\\xa0 My administration will do everything possible to help those communities get back on their feet.\\xa0 We’re speaking with the governors and representatives.\\xa0 FEMA is already on its way, and they got there — as soon as we heard the word, I said, “Get out there.”\\xa0 So FEMA is there, and you know the great job that FEMA does.\\xa0 It’s, really, something very special.\\n\\nSo we just want to say: Warmest condolences, and we’re with you all the way.\\xa0 It’s a tough deal.\\xa0 That was a bad, bed level five.\\xa0 That was a bad group.\\xa0 That’s as high as it gets.\\xa0 It was a bad grouping of tornadoes.\\xa0 Something that’s something incredible, the power — the horrible, destructive power.\\n\\nAmerica is continuing to make critical progress in our war against the virus.\\xa0 Over the weekend, the number of daily new infections remained flat nationwide.\\xa0 Flat.\\xa0 Hospitalizations are slowing in hotspots like New York, New Jersey, Michigan, and Louisiana.\\xa0 This is clear evidence that our aggressive strategy to combat the virus is working and that Americans are following the guidelines.\\xa0 It’s been incredible what they’ve done.\\n\\nYou looked at the charts, and the charts are — and the models from early on — predictions were 100 [thousand] and 120,000 people look like.\\xa0 If they did well, they were going to unfortunately perish.\\xa0 And we’re going to be, hopefully, way, way below that number.\\xa0 So that will be a sign of people doing things right, but it’s still just a horrible thing all over the world.\\xa0 A hundred and eighty-four countries.\\n\\nThis is all a tribute to our wonderful healthcare advisors and experts who have been with us right from the beginning.\\xa0 We appreciate it so much.\\xa0 In fact, Dr. Fauci is here.\\xa0 Maybe I could ask Tony to say a few words before we go any further.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\xa0 Tony, please.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Just one — a couple of things, and then I just want to make a comment about something that happened yesterday.\\n\\nYou’re going to hear from Dr. Birx soon about the numbers that we’ve been talking about and how things are starting to balance off.\\xa0 And I think the more, as we go by each day, I think we’re going to see — and again, I never like to get ahead of myself or of Dr. Birx, but it looks like even though we’ve had a really bad week last week — remember, when I was speaking to you before, I was saying this was really a bad week — there’s still going to be a lot of deaths, but we’re starting to see in some areas now that kind of flattening, particularly in a place that was a hotspot like New York.\\xa0 That’s the first thing.\\n\\nThe second thing is that I had a really very, very productive conversation with the Congressional Black Caucus this morning, for about an hour, and they really wanted to know what exactly are we going to be doing in the immediate, as well as the long range, about the health disparities and the discrepancies both in infection and in poor outcome in the minorities in general, but specifically African American.\\n\\nAnd, I mean, I made it very clear to them that what we have to do is focus on getting the resources where the vulnerable are, to be able to get testing done, to be able to get the appropriate identification, where proper and where appropriate, to isolate and contact trace if we can, but also to help mitigate in a community that is suffering and suffering much more disproportionately.\\n\\nSo I just wanted to get that out of the way.\\n\\nThe other point I wanted to make is that I had an interview yesterday that I was asked a hypothetical question.\\xa0 And hypothetical questions sometimes can get you into some difficulty because it’s what “would have” or “could have.”\\xa0 The nature of the hypothetical question was: If, in fact, we had mitigated earlier, could lives have been saved?\\xa0 And the answer to my question was, as I always do — and I’m doing right now — perfectly honestly say, “yes.”\\xa0 I mean, obviously.\\xa0 If you — mitigation helps.\\n\\nI’ve been up here many times telling you that mitigation works.\\xa0 So if mitigation works, and you instigated and — you initiated earlier, you will probably have saved more lives.\\xa0 If you initiated it later, you probably would have lost more lives, if you initiated at a certain time.\\n\\nThat was taken as a way that maybe, somehow, something was at fault here.\\n\\nSo let me tell you from my experience — and I can only speak from my own experience — is that we had been talking, before any meetings that we had, about the pros and the cons, the effectiveness or not, of strong mitigations.\\xa0 So discussions were going on mostly among the medical people about what that would mean.\\n\\nThe first and only time that Dr. Birx and I went in and formally made a recommendation to the President to actually have a, quote, “shutdown” in the sense of — not really “shutdown” but to really have strong mitigation, we discussed it.\\xa0 Obviously, there would be concern by some that, in fact, that might have some negative consequences.\\xa0 Nonetheless, the President listened to the recommendation and went to the mitigation.\\n\\nThe next second time that I went with Dr. Birx in — to the President and said, “Fifteen days are not enough.\\xa0 We need to go thirty days,” obviously, there were people who had a problem with that because of the potential secondary effects.\\xa0 Nonetheless, at that time, the President went with the health recommendations, and we extended it another 30 days.\\n\\nSo I can only tell you what I know and what my recommendations were.\\xa0 But, clearly, as happens all the time, there were interpretations of that response to a hypothetical question that I just thought it would be very nice for me to clarify because I didn’t have the chance to clarify.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The date on that?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Excuse me?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The date.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 You know, to be honest with you, I don’t even remember what the date was.\\xa0 But I can just tell you the first and only time that I went in and said we should do mitigation strongly, the response was, “Yes, we’ll do it.”\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And what did he do?\\xa0 Was that the travel restrictions?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 The travel restriction is separate.\\xa0 That was whether or not we wanted to go into a mitigation stage of 15 days of mitigation.\\xa0 The travel was another recommendation, when we went in and said, “We probably should be doing that.”\\xa0 And the answer was “yes.”\\xa0 And then another time was, “We should do it with Europe,” and the answer was “yes.”\\xa0 And the next time, “We should do it with the UK,” and the answer was “yes.”\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 In this interview, you said there was pushback.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Where did that pushback come from?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 No, it wasn’t — that was the wrong choice of words.\\xa0 You know what it was?\\xa0 When people discuss, not necessarily in front of the President — when people discuss, they say, “Well, you know, this is going to have maybe a harmful effect on this or on that.”\\xa0 So it was a poor choice of words.\\xa0 There wasn’t anybody saying, “No, you shouldn’t do that.”\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you doing this voluntarily?\\xa0 Or did the President —\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 No, I’m doing it —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — or Vice President ask you to do this?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Everything I do is voluntarily.\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 Don’t even imply that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, Mr. President, the question is —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And, by the way, the travel ban, that was earlier.\\xa0 The travel ban was done earlier.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You couldn’t give us a date when he talked to you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And if you look at statistics — I happened to write a couple of them down.\\xa0 If you look at statistics — so, on January 6th — that’s long before the dates you’re talking about — there were — CDC issued a travel notice for Wuhan, China, a notice, before there was even a confirmed case of the virus in the United States.\\xa0 That’s on January 6th.\\xa0 This is all documented.\\xa0 Because we have so much fake news, I like to document things.\\xa0 January 6th, long before the dates we’re talking about, CDC issued travel notice to Wuhan — for Wuhan.\\n\\nOn January 11th, we have zero cases in the United States.\\xa0 Zero.\\xa0 We don’t have any cases.\\xa0 So there are no cases reported that we know of.\\xa0 This is January 11th.\\xa0 The CDC issued a level one travel notice health — for health, while there were still no confirmed cases.\\xa0 So we had zero cases.\\xa0 People want me to act.\\xa0 I’m supposed to close down the economy — the greatest economy in the history of the world — and we don’t have one case confirmed in the United States.\\xa0 That’s January 11th.\\n\\nOn January 17th, the CDC began implementing public health entry screenings at three major U.S. airports that received the greatest volume of passengers from Wuhan, at my instructions.\\xa0 There was not a single case of the coronavirus in the United States.\\xa0 So on January 17th, there wasn’t a case, and the fake news is saying, “Oh, he didn’t act fast enough.”\\xa0 Well, you remember what happened.\\xa0 Because when I did act, I was criticized by Nancy Pelosi, by Sleepy Joe Biden.\\xa0 I was criticized by everybody.\\xa0 In fact, I was called xenophobic.\\xa0 I was asking Biden to please define that for me.\\xa0 I was called other things by Democrats and some others — not too many others, actually.\\xa0 So that — by the media, definitely.\\n\\nNow, on January 21st — this is long before the time we’re talking, because when Tony is talking, I believe he’s talking about the end of February.\\xa0 On January 21st, okay — still early — there was one case of the virus.\\xa0 At that time, we called it the “Wuhan virus,” right?\\xa0 Wuhan.\\xa0 There was one case in the whole United States.\\xa0 We have one case.\\xa0 This is all documented.\\xa0 It all comes from you.\\xa0 A lot of it comes from you people.\\n\\nOn January 21st, the CDC activated an emergency operation center.\\xa0 There was just one case, one person.\\xa0 That’s why that ad was such a phony.\\xa0 There was one person in the United States.\\xa0 You know they used the ad, “There’s only one person…”\\xa0 That statement was made at that time.\\xa0 One case.\\xa0 In the whole United States, one case.\\xa0 I’m supposed to shut down the government?\\xa0 The biggest — the biggest economy in the history of the world.\\xa0 “Shut it down.\\xa0 We have one case.”\\n\\nSeven cases were on January 31st.\\xa0 Now, on January 21st, there was a case.\\xa0 Not one person had died.\\xa0 You heard that, Steve, right?\\xa0 Not one person.\\n\\nSo we have this massive country, the United States of America.\\xa0 We have the greatest economy in the world — bigger than China’s, by a lot — right? — because of what we’ve done over the last three and a half years, prior to the virus, but including the virus.\\xa0 So we have the biggest economy, the greatest economy we’ve ever had; the highest employment numbers; the best employment numbers; best unemployment numbers also.\\xa0 The best of everything.\\n\\nSo, on January 31st — think of it — not one person has died.\\xa0 Not one.\\xa0 Nobody died.\\xa0 Not one, Jon.\\xa0 I don’t think you’ll find any.\\xa0 This is reported by CDC, confirmed by the news — which doesn’t mean anything to me because they don’t tell the truth.\\xa0 But CDC reported: January 31st, not one person has died.\\nAnd I issued a travel restriction from China.\\xa0 Think of it.\\xa0 So nobody died, and I issued.\\xa0 You can’t get earlier than that.\\n\\nSo we have nobody died, and I said, “China, you can’t come in.\\xa0 I’m sorry.”\\xa0 Because I saw what was going on.\\xa0 It wasn’t so much what I was told; it was that I saw what was going on and I didn’t like it.\\xa0 But I didn’t speak to Tony about it.\\xa0 Didn’t speak to very many people about it.\\xa0 I didn’t like it.\\n\\nSo what did I do?\\xa0 Ready?\\xa0 January 31st: In the United States, not one person had died because of the — again, the Wuhan virus.\\xa0 So I issued travel restrictions on that date, even though nobody died, and I got brutalized over it by the press because I was way too early; I shouldn’t have done it.\\xa0 Brutalized by the press.\\xa0 But, you know, sort of — I’ve been brutalized for the last four years.\\xa0 I used to do well before I decided to run for politics.\\xa0 But I guess I’m doing okay because, to the best of my knowledge, I’m the President of the United States, despite the things that are said.\\n\\nSo, then, first mandatory quarantine in more than 50 years, we did.\\xa0 First mandatory in 50 years.\\xa0 The same restrictions that the Democrats and the media called “xenophobic.”\\xa0 Now, Joe Biden said, “He’s a racist.”\\xa0 He called me a racist because I said, “We’re shutting down entry from China.\\xa0 We’re shutting it down.”\\xa0 He called me xenophobic, and he called me racist and other things.\\n\\nSince then, on a Friday night, two weeks ago, Joe Biden issued a state- — it wasn’t him; he didn’t write it.\\xa0 I’m sure he doesn’t even know that it was issued.\\xa0 But the people from his campaign — who are smart.\\xa0 The people that write those little PR releases are pretty smart, reasonably good.\\xa0 Not the best, but they’re not bad.\\xa0 But they issued a statement, saying that Joe Biden agrees that the Pres- — that President Trump was right to close it down to China.\\xa0 Now, he did that.\\n\\nNow, he issued it on Friday night.\\xa0 We’ve all heard about that, Jon — Friday nights, right?\\xa0 In fact, his was later Friday night than I ever released mine on Friday night.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible) seems pretty late.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So he did — he did it pretty late.\\xa0 I mean, you know, like at 11 o’clock in the evening or something.\\xa0 You know, that’s pretty late.\\xa0 Anyway.\\xa0 So Joe Biden issued — and it’s one of those things.\\n\\nBut, in February, Nancy Pelosi said we should come to Chinatown.\\xa0 This is late February.\\xa0 “Come to Chinatown.\\xa0 We think it’s very safe.\\xa0 Come here.\\xa0 Let’s all have the big parade — Chinatown parade.”\\xa0 Probably referring to San Francisco.\\xa0 And that’s it.\\n\\nBut I took this action early.\\xa0 And so the story in the New York Times was a total fake.\\xa0 It’s a fake newspaper and they write fake stories.\\xa0 And someday — hopefully in five years, when I’m not here — those papers are all going out of business because nobody is going to want to read them.\\xa0 But now they like them because they write about me.\\n\\nNow, with that, I have a couple of interesting — we have a few clips that we’re just going to put up.\\xa0 We could turn the lights a little bit lower.\\xa0 I think you’ll find them interesting.\\xa0 And then we’ll answer some questions.\\xa0 I’ll ask you some questions because you’re so guilty, but forget it.\\xa0 But most importantly, we’re going to get back onto the reason we’re here, which is the success we’re having.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nPlease, you could put it on.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\n(A video is played.)\\n\\nSo we could give you hundreds of clips like that from governors — including Democratic or “Democrat,” as I call them, governors, which is actually the correct term.\\xa0 We could give you hundreds of clips just like that.\\xa0 We have them.\\xa0 We didn’t want this to go on too long, but I just want to say it’s — you know, it’s very sad when people write false stories like, in that case, I guess it was gotten mostly from the New York Times, which is a highly — I mean, if you had libel laws, they would have been out of business even before they’ll end up going out of business.\\xa0 So it’s too bad.\\n\\nBut we could have given you — you saw the statements.\\xa0 We have hundreds of statements.\\xa0 Hundreds of statements, including from Democrats and Democrat governors.\\n\\nAnd if you look, they were all saying, “We need ventilators.\\xa0 We need…”\\xa0 You don’t hear “ventilators” anymore.\\xa0 They have all the ventilators they need, which we were right about.\\xa0 We said, “You’re asking for too many.\\xa0 You don’t need that.”\\xa0 And, in all fairness, these two people right here — Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci — they said, “I don’t think they need that many ventilators.”\\xa0 And I said, “I agree.”\\n\\nAt one point — and I’m not knocking New York for this, but they were asking — you remember? — 40,000 ventilators.\\xa0 And that’s more than they have all over the country.\\xa0 And we got them a lot of ventilators, and nobody has complained.\\n\\nWe got them, as you know, beautiful — we built hospital rooms all over the country.\\xa0 The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, was very nice.\\xa0 He said, “You know what?\\xa0 You don’t have to build a second hospital.”\\xa0 Because good news is happening.\\xa0 They’re not able to fill the beds.\\xa0 They needed two hospitals.\\xa0 We built one; it was perfect.\\xa0 We’re getting — we’re just starting the other.\\xa0 I called him up.\\xa0 I said, “Do you think we should build the second one?\\xa0 I don’t think you’re going to need it.”\\xa0 He said, “Let me get back.”\\xa0 He got back.\\xa0 We didn’t need it.\\n\\nWith Governor Cuomo, in all good spirit and faith, he wanted to have the Jacob Javits Center done.\\xa0 And we built 2,900 incredible beds.\\xa0 Incredible.\\xa0 Then we make it — we made it COVID — and — or, to be exactly accurate, COVID-19, and — which was a lot of work.\\xa0 We had to change the ductwork.\\xa0 We had to seal up certain areas.\\xa0 We had to put areas of rooftop things over the beds.\\xa0 We did a lot of work.\\xa0 And we had it — but they never really had too much use for it.\\n\\nAnd they called also — Mayor de Blasio, rightfully, he called.\\xa0 He said, “Would it be possible to get more medical help?”\\xa0 So, now, not only are we building facilities, we’re — they’re asking us for help because they’re unable to man it.\\xa0 And we got him the help.\\xa0 We got Mayor de Blasio a lot of help.\\n\\nThen, when the Javits Center wasn’t used much — and then, as you know, the Mercy — and we took the Mercy and we took the Comfort, and we made them both — Los Angeles and New York — we made them COVID-adaptable, which was not easy to do.\\xa0 And we didn’t get almost any people sent there.\\xa0 They didn’t need them at the beginning because they didn’t need it for anything but this because there were fewer accidents, fewer motorcycles, fewer everything.\\n\\nAnd what we did was like an incredible job, but they didn’t need them.\\xa0 It turned out — they were there.\\xa0 We were ready.\\xa0 You know the expression?\\xa0 They have an expression: “Ready, willing, and able.”\\xa0 We were ready, willing, and able.\\xa0 What the Army Corps of Engineers did was a miracle.\\xa0 What — what FEMA did was a miracle.\\xa0 What the doctors did.\\n\\nSo I got a call two days ago from the mayor of New York.\\xa0 He said, “Could you help us even more with medical personnel?”\\xa0 And we sent — I think it was 448 doctors, nurses, and respiratory experts.\\xa0 Real experts.\\xa0 And I got a call from the mayor and he said, “I want to tell you: Incredible — these people are incredible.”\\xa0 He said, “They lifted the spirits of the hospital workers from New York City like nothing I’ve ever seen.”\\xa0 He’s — he was unbelievable, what he said.\\xa0 It was really appreciated.\\xa0 And I let them know that.\\xa0 I let the military people — he said, “They went in there so brave, so incredible.\\xa0 They lifted the spirits of everybody.”\\n\\nWe did all of this work, but when you read the phony stories, you — nobody — nobody acknowledges this.\\xa0 And it doesn’t have to be acknowledged, from my standpoint, but it does have to be acknowledged from the great work that these doctors, nurses, the Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA — all these people, they’ve done this incredible job.\\xa0 And they shouldn’t be abused because — you take a look at what’s happened.\\xa0 Nobody is asking for ventilators, except outside of our country.\\n\\nOutside of our country, they’re calling me — every country.\\xa0 They’re calling me.\\xa0 So many countries.\\xa0 And I’m going to try and help them because we have thousands of ventilators being built.\\xa0 But nobody is asking for ventilators.\\xa0 Nobody is asking for beds because we built hospitals.\\xa0 I think we built 20,000 beds in a period of a couple of weeks.\\n\\nThe job they’ve done is incredible.\\xa0 With all of that being said, I’m getting along very well with governors.\\xa0 And if I wouldn’t, Mike Pence had a call today with the governors and it was like a 10.\\xa0 I said, “How was it?”\\xa0 He said, “It’s a 10.”\\xa0 He was one of my expressions, actually.\\xa0 But he said it was like a 10.\\n\\nAnd I’m sure you people were probably on the call, although you weren’t supposed to be.\\xa0 But you were sitting in somebody’s office listening to it, because every time we have these — and, you know, and you would know that for weeks those calls have been very good.\\xa0 But there wasn’t a raised voice.\\xa0 There wasn’t even a statement of like, “We think you should do this or that.”\\xa0 I heard it was, like, just a perfect phone call.\\xa0 It might not be reported that way.\\xa0 They’ll say, “I thought that somebody maybe slightly raised…”\\xa0 Didn’t even raise a voice.\\n\\nMy only point of saying this, because I want to get back to why we’re here: The press has not treated these incredible people who’ve done such a great job, they haven’t treated them fairly.\\xa0 They’re way off.\\xa0 We were way ahead of schedule.\\n\\nAnd remember this — because the Times story was a fake — but everything — remember this: Everything we did, I was criticized because I was too early.\\xa0 If I waited longer, it would have been — you would have been critic- — if I went way early, if I went three months earlier, I would have been criticized — you know, criticized for being way too early.\\n\\nSo, with all of that being said, we understand it.\\xa0 I think I’ve educated a lot of people as to the press.\\xa0 And I would love to be able to say that we have a very honest press.\\xa0 Honestly, Jon, there’d be nothing I would be more proud of if the press would work — and I don’t mind being criticized, but not when they’re wrong.\\xa0 Not when people have done a great job.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I just ask you about the video?\\xa0 Because I’ve never seen a video like that played in this room.\\xa0 It looks a bit like a campaign ad.\\xa0 Who — who produced that video for you?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That was done by a group in the office, and it was done just by — we just put some clips together.\\xa0\\xa0 I could give you — I’ll bet you I have over 100 more clips even better than them.\\xa0 They were just pieced together over the last two hours.\\xa0 That was just — oh, we have far better than that.\\xa0 That’s nothing compared to some of them.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But this was produced here in the White House by —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, this was done by Dan and a group of people, and they just put it together in a period of probably less than two hours.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Why did you feel the need to do that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Because we’re getting fake news, and I like to have it corrected.\\xa0 They’re saying what a great job we’re doing, and the media — these are the governors of California, governor of New Jersey, governor of New York.\\n\\nLook, in New York, we work very close with Andrew.\\xa0 In New York, ventilators — we’re going to be probably — we didn’t — they didn’t have a problem.\\xa0 We got them tremendous numbers of — thousands, but we got them a tremendous number of ventilator. You don’t hear ventilators are a problem.\\xa0 Beds were going to be a problem.\\xa0 I mean, I’m happy about it.\\xa0 The Javits Center, which is incredible, is almost empty because they don’t need them.\\xa0 That’s good news, not bad news.\\xa0 I’m — you know, I’m not saying, “Gee, I wish more people were there.”\\xa0 I don’t want more people there.\\n\\nWe brought in the boat.\\xa0 We brought in the Comfort.\\xa0 And the Comfort was originally not supposed to be for this at all — the coronavirus.\\xa0 It was not supposed to be for that at all.\\xa0 They called, they said, “Could we have it?”\\xa0 That was a number of weeks ago.\\xa0 We said, “We don’t think you need it, but if you need it, we’ll do it.”\\xa0 Then they said, “Could you get the medical personnel to run the Javits Center?\\xa0 Could you get the medical personnel to run the ship?”\\xa0 We said, “If it’s necessary, we will.”\\xa0 And we did.\\xa0 There were military personnel.\\xa0 That’s the ones that Mayor de Blasio was so great to, in terms of his statements.\\xa0 I mean, I really appreciated his statements.\\xa0 He was so impressed with them, and I am too.\\xa0 The level of genius and bravery.\\xa0 They’re great people, the military people.\\n\\nAnd we pieced that together — I would say it took less than two hours.\\xa0 It was done in house.\\n\\nSteve?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But just to be clear, this was produced by government employees, by people here at the White House — this campaign-style video here?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I wouldn’t use the word “produced.”\\xa0 All they did was took some clips, and they just ran them for you.\\xa0 And the reason they did is to keep you honest.\\xa0 Now, I don’t think that’s going to work.\\xa0 It’s not going to have any impact.\\xa0 But just think of it: You heard the clips, you heard what I said.\\xa0 They said I acted late on closing down the country.\\n\\nSome people wish we never closed it down.\\xa0 Now, if we didn’t, we would have lost hundreds of thousands of people.\\xa0 You know, interestingly — so I’m — I’m against that.\\xa0 We did the right thing.\\xa0 Everything we did was right.\\xa0 If we would have closed down —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You don’t think you made any mistakes along the way here?\\xa0 You think everything you did was right?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well — well, look, governors should have had ventilators; they chose not to have them.\\xa0 We were able to get them ventilators.\\xa0 You haven’t heard — other than, you know, there was a lot of panic, a lot of screaming, “We want ventilators.”\\xa0 They got the ventilators.\\xa0 You don’t have that anymore.\\xa0 And the surge is supposed to be coming now.\\xa0 And if they do need ventilators, Jon, we’ve got almost 10,000 that are ready to rock.\\xa0 We have people standing with those ventilators right now.\\xa0 If you needed 2,000 in New York, which you don’t, but if you did, we can have them here in less than 24 hours.\\xa0 We’re ready to rock.\\xa0 This was a great — this was a great military — and beyond that — operation.\\n\\nLet’s get back to the regular.\\xa0 Shouldn’t we get back to the regular?\\xa0 We could talk about this, but all I’m doing is this: I could have given you — like, those are four or five clips that we just played for you.\\xa0 I could have given you hundreds of people — I mean, Gavin was on television two days ago with one of your competitors, singing praises.\\xa0 He says, “Look…”\\xa0 You know, the question was asked in a negative way.\\xa0 He said, “Look, I know what you want to say but — want me to say, but he’s been really good.\\xa0 It’s hard for me to say that.\\xa0 In fact, it’s impossible for me to say it.”\\xa0 Gavin Newsom, the governor of California.\\n\\nI have many clips from many — I have some clips from Anthony, that I didn’t want to put up, which were really good.\\xa0 I think Anthony would be the first one to say, when I closed the country to China, when I closed the — the China ban, whatever you want to call it — Anthony said I saved a lot of lives by doing that.\\xa0 I mean, am I correct?\\xa0 I don’t want to put words in Anthony’s mouth, by the way, and I like him.\\n\\nToday, I walk in and I hear I’m going to fire him.\\xa0 I’m not firing — I think he’s a wonderful guy.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But why did you tweet something that said “Fire Fauci”?\\xa0 Why did you —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You retweeted the hashtag #FireFauci.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I retweeted somebody.\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 They said “fire.”\\xa0 It doesn’t matter.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Did you notice that when you retweeted it?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I notice everything.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you retweeted it even though it said, “Time to fire Fauci”?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no, that’s somebody’s opinion.\\xa0 All that is is an opinion.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But you read it and you elevated it.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I was called about that.\\xa0 I said, “I’m not firing him.”\\xa0 In fact, if you ask your friends in the office — in the public relations office, I was immediately called upon that.\\xa0 And I said, “No, I like him.\\xa0 I think he’s terrific.”\\xa0 Because this was a person’s view.\\xa0 Not everybody is happy with Anthony.\\xa0 Not everybody is happy with everybody.\\n\\nBut I will tell you, we have done a job, the likes of which nobody has ever done.\\xa0 The mobilization, getting of equipment, all of the things we’ve done — nobody has ever done a job like this.\\n\\nWe have 50 governors — and territories, by the way.\\xa0 People don’t ever mention that we have territories.\\xa0 We have 50 governors and territories, and many of those governors are Democrats, and they can’t find anything to complain about.\\xa0 And honestly, many of them didn’t do their jobs.\\xa0 I’ll let you know someday — let’s see what happens — but I may let you know who’s not doing their job.\\xa0 I can tell you the ones that are good, both Republican and Democrat, and the ones who don’t know what they’re doing.\\xa0 But we help some of the ones that don’t know what they’re doing.\\xa0 They should have had their own stockpiles. \\xa0And now, if they want, we can build them stockpiles of ventilators.\\n\\nThe hardest thing is a ventilator, because it’s expensive, it takes a while to get.\\xa0 We got them, and nobody believed we did.\\n\\nNow, many of the governors were asking for far too many.\\xa0 And we said they were asking for far too many.\\xa0 We talked and we said — you said very strongly that they just don’t need that many.\\xa0 You said they don’t need that many beds — Deborah.\\n\\nSo that’s it.\\xa0\\xa0 Steve, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To be clear, you and Dr. Fauci are on the same page?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, we have been from the beginning.\\xa0 I don’t know what it is exactly.\\xa0 But if I put somebody’s opinion up — you know, I don’t mind controversy.\\xa0 I think controversy is a good thing, not a bad thing.\\xa0 But I want it to be honest controversy.\\n\\nNow, when I got a call — I got a call not very quickly; nobody, you know, saw that as being any big deal — they said, “How are you doing with Dr. Fauci?”\\xa0 I said, “I’m doing great.”\\xa0 And I didn’t talk to Dr. Fauci, even until we just got here.\\xa0 Dr. Fauci asked one of the people if he could get up and speak, and he did.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So he said that once you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And they totally misinterpreted him.\\xa0 I saw what they did.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I — can I ask you?\\xa0 He said the question was hypothetical.\\xa0 But what he was just acknowledging is that lives would have been saved if the mitigation practices were put into place earlier.\\xa0 That seems obvious.\\xa0 Do you not agree with that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Here’s the thing.\\xa0 No, no.\\xa0 What he really is saying though: “But how could you have done it?”\\xa0 Look, I just went over stats with you.\\xa0 Right here.\\xa0 Right here.\\n\\nHow do you close it up?\\xa0 You have no deaths and no cases on January 11th.\\xa0 Doctor, would you recommend closing the United States of America?”\\xa0 “Oh, this must be terrible.\\xa0 How many cases do we have?”\\xa0 “None.”\\xa0 How many deaths do we have?”\\xa0 “None.”\\n\\nJanuary 17th — go back another week.\\xa0 On January 17th — this is 10 days before I did the — little bit less than 10 days before I did the ban.\\xa0 I did a ban on China.\\xa0 You think that was easy?\\xa0 I then did a ban on Europe.\\xa0 And a lot of people said that was an incredible thing to do, because you look at Spain — and, by the way, we’re doing very well because when you look at all of those flat graphs and you add it all up, the United States is very low, and per capita we’re very low.\\xa0 We’re doing very well.\\n\\nBut how do you close up the United States of America?\\xa0 So, on January 6th, no deaths.\\xa0 On January 11th, no deaths.\\xa0 And no — no cases.\\xa0 On January 17th, no cases, no cases, no deaths.\\xa0 I’m supposed to close up the United States of America when I have no cases?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You didn’t close down until the middle of March.\\xa0 “Should you have closed it down earlier?” —\\xa0that’s the question.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I closed down from China.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s not about January.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Excuse me, I closed it down from China.\\xa0 And, by the way, some people think I should have waited longer and maybe ridden it out.\\xa0 I disagree with them.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 But it was thought of.\\xa0 I mean, that was an alternative.\\xa0 You know, there are a lot of people that would have said, “Let’s ride it out.”\\xa0 Now, I’ll give you the good news.\\xa0 If I would have done that, it would have been, I think, catastrophic because their numbers are, Anthony, 1.6 to 2.2 million people would have died if we tried to do that.\\n\\nAnd I did this last time: Cut it in half.\\xa0 Don’t say 2.2 million.\\xa0 Cut it in more than half.\\xa0 Say a million people died — well, that’s much more than the Civil War.\\xa0 Cut it in half.\\xa0 Take the million and cut it in half; that’s 500,000 people would have died.\\xa0 Now, that number we would have reached.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 That would have been easy to reach if we did nothing.\\xa0 So we did the right thing, and our timing was very good.\\n\\nBut here’s the one thing — and you have to say this — when you ask me, “Why didn’t you do this?”\\xa0— how come when I did the ban on China and some very, very — instituted some very tough things, how come Nancy Pelosi, a month later, is in Chinatown, saying, “Let’s all march.\\xa0 This is not going to happen”?\\xa0 How come we have many of the experts from CNN and many other networks — if you call CNN a network; I don’t, personally.\\xa0 But we have CNN, we have many other places, and they’re all saying, “He doesn’t need to do it.\\xa0 He doesn’t need to do it.”\\n\\nAll I’m saying is this: How do you close down the greatest economy in the history of the world when, on January 17th, you have no cases and no death; when on January 21st, you have one case and no death?\\xa0 One case.\\xa0 Think of it.\\xa0 Now, we’re supposed to close down the country?\\n\\nBut here’s what happened: When, on January 31st, I instituted the ban, Joe Biden went crazy.\\xa0 He said, “You don’t need the ban.\\xa0 You…”\\xa0 He didn’t go crazy.\\xa0 Like, he has — he didn’t even know what the hell the ban was.\\xa0 But he — so he didn’t go crazy.\\xa0 But he did say —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Your ban bought you time.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He did call me xenophobic.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What did you do with that time?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Wait a minute.\\xa0 He called me xenophobic; he called me a racist because — he has since apologized and he said I did the right thing.\\xa0 So when you say, “Why didn’t you do this?”\\xa0 Every Democrat thought I made a mistake when I did it.\\xa0 I saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of lives, by doing that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But what did you do with that time that you bought?\\xa0 The argument is that you bought yourself some time and you didn’t use it to prepare hospitals, you didn’t use it to ramp up testing.\\xa0 Right now —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You’re so — you’re so —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — nearly 20 million people are unemployed.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You’re so disgraceful.\\xa0 It’s so disgraceful the way you say that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Tens of thousands of Americans are dead.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Let me just — listen.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How is this sizzle reel —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I just went over it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — or this rant supposed to make people feel confident —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I just went over it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — in an unprecedented crisis?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Nobody thought we should do it.\\xa0 And when I did it —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But what did you do with the time that you bought?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You know what we did?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The month of February.\\xa0 That —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You know what we did?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 That video has a gap.\\xa0 The entire month of February.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 What do you do — what do you do when you have no case in the whole United States when you —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You had cases in February.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Excuse me.\\xa0 You reported it: zero cases, zero deaths on January 17th.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 January.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 January, February — the entire month of February.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 January.\\xa0 I said in January.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Your video has a complete gap: the month of February.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 On January 30th —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What did your administration do in February with the time that your travel ban bought you?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 A lot.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 A lot.\\xa0 And, in fact, we’ll give you a list — what we did.\\xa0 In fact, part of it was up there.\\xa0 We did a lot.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It wasn’t in the video.\\xa0 The video had a gap.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Look.\\xa0 Look, you know you’re a fake.\\xa0 You know that.\\xa0 Your whole network — the way you cover it — is fake.\\xa0 And most of you — and not all of you — but the people are wise to you.\\xa0 That’s why you have a lower — a lower approval rating than you’ve ever had before, times probably three.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Twenty million people now are unemployed.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And when you ask me that questions —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Tens of thousands of people are dead, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Let me ask you this: Why didn’t Biden — why did Biden apologize?\\xa0 Why did he write a letter of apology?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I don’t think the unemployed people right now care about why Joe Biden didn’t apologize to you, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Why did the Democrats think that I acted too quickly?\\xa0 You know why?\\xa0 Because they really thought that I acted too quickly.\\xa0 We have done a great job.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So get us the list of what you did in February.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Now, I could’ve — I could’ve kept it open.\\xa0 And I could’ve done what some countries are doing.\\xa0 They’re getting beat up pretty badly.\\xa0 I could have kept it open.\\xa0 I thought of keeping it open because nobody has ever heard of closing down a country, let alone the United States of America.\\xa0 But if I would have done that, we would have had hundreds of thousands of people that would right now be dead.\\n\\nWe’ve done this right.\\xa0 And we really — we really have done this right.\\xa0 The problem is the press doesn’t cover it the way it should be.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 One more question.\\xa0 Steve, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There’s a debate over what authority you have to order the country reopened.\\xa0 What authority do you have?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I have the ultimate authority, but we’re going to get into that in a minute.\\xa0 We’re going to just finish this up.\\xa0 We’re going to tell you about other things that we’ve done right.\\n\\nBut I will say this: Had we said, “Let’s just keep going and let’s not do a closing” — whether it’s 2.2 that they, at one point, predicted as an outside or 1.6 at a lower number; you cut it all the way down to 6- or 7- or 800,000; take just a fraction of the number that could have happened, it literally would have been more than the Civil War.\\xa0 It would have been a disaster.\\n\\nSo, the minimum number was 100,000.\\xa0 And I think — I feel pretty good that we’re going to be substantially below, Anthony, the 100,000.\\xa0 And I hope we will.\\n\\nAll right.\\xa0 So, today, the Department of Health and Human Services is announcing five new contracts to procure large numbers of additional ventilators under the Defense Production Act, which we used a lot, by the way — which you didn’t like to talk about — in addition to the 1,300 we received today.\\xa0 We received, today, 1,300 additional ventilators.\\xa0 Now, we’re probably not going to need them, but we can add that to our stockpile, which is very big, and we can move it around should the surge take place and should it be a very substantial surge.\\xa0 We’re ready to — we’re ready to rock.\\n\\nThe contracts are with General Electric, Hillrom, Medtronic, ResMed, and Vyaire, combined with the DPA contracts that we announced last week with General Motors and Philips and two other contracts with Hamilton and ZOLL.\\xa0 We’re adding 6,190 ventilators to the Strategic National Stockpile, of which we have a lot already — thousands — close to 10,000.\\xa0 But this will be added by May 8th, another 29,000 by the end of May.\\xa0 And more than 120,000 total we will have by the end of the year.\\n\\nNow, we’re going to help other countries.\\xa0 We’re going to help states if they need it.\\xa0 We may help some states’ stockpile.\\xa0 You know, they’re supposed to buy their own stockpile.\\xa0 They have state stockpiles.\\xa0 They’re supposed to be using that.\\xa0 And unfortunately, most of the states weren’t there.\\xa0 And a lot of people didn’t want to talk about it, but they weren’t there.\\xa0 We will talk about it at the right time, if you want to.\\xa0 I — at this point, I’m more focused on getting past this nightmare of a epidemic or a pandemic — anything you want to call it.\\xa0 We got to get past it.\\n\\nNo one who has needed a ventilator has not gotten a ventilator.\\xa0 Think of that.\\xa0 You know, you heard all about ventilators, ventilators.\\xa0 “We need ventilators.”\\xa0 Because they didn’t have them.\\xa0 Because the states should have had them.\\xa0 No one who has needed a ventilator has not gotten a ventilator.\\xa0 No one who has needed a hospital bed has been denied a hospital bed.\\xa0 That’s not even really our responsibility.\\n\\nNow, if we can help, we’re going to do it.\\xa0 But that’s where the Army Corps of Engineers did such a great job.\\xa0 We built over 20,000 beds.\\xa0 In fact, we built thousands more than we’ve actually needed to be safe.\\xa0 We wanted to be safe and we really — they rose to this incredible occasion.\\n\\nI mean, we built more beds than we thought.\\xa0 We thought, in Louisiana, we were going heavy.\\xa0 And again, when I called the governor, I said, “Maybe we shouldn’t build that second hospital, because we don’t want to build it if you don’t need it.”\\xa0 He called back, he said, “I don’t think we’re going to need it.”\\xa0 They had 1,000 rooms, 1,000 beds, and they used a lot of them, but they didn’t need the other one so we stopped it because we don’t want to waste.\\n\\nBut we’re prepared to build thousands more should we need it.\\xa0 I don’t think we’re going to need it because it looks like we’re plateauing and maybe even, in many cases, coming down.\\n\\nIn addition, we’ve ordered a total of 60 mobile decontamidation [sic] — -contamination systems.\\xa0 So the decontamination system from Battelle, in Ohio, is an incredible thing because it takes the masks, and up to 20 times you can decontaminate a mask.\\xa0 And I’ve been asking from the beginning: “Why can’t we sterilize and sanitize these masks?”\\xa0 And it turned out we can.\\xa0 And there was a great company in Ohio, they sent us some great equipment, and they’re doing that now.\\n\\nAnd now we’re going to have more than 33 million N95 masks per week will be cleaned, decontaminated, and it’ll be great.\\xa0 It’s something that, frankly, I think people should have thought of a long time ago.\\n\\nFive more flights landed today as part of the Project Air Bridge — our massive air lift operation to bring personal protective equipment into the United States, which has now delivered nearly half a million N95 masks, 370 million gloves, 25 million surgical masks, and 4.9 million gowns.\\xa0 So, we have millions of gowns, gloves, masks, all surgical equipment coming in should the states need it.\\n\\nNow, the states — the states are supposed to be buying their own stuff.\\xa0 But should they need it, we are ready to give them, because we’re building up our stockpile again like crazy.\\n\\nRemember, I — and you saw the stories.\\xa0 I inherited — this administration — Mike, myself, the whole administration, we inherited a stockpile where the cupboards were bare.\\xa0 There was nothing.\\xa0 And I say it and I’ll say it again: Just like we didn’t have ammunition, we didn’t have medical supplies, we didn’t have ventilators, we didn’t have a lot of things that should have been had.\\xa0 And you can read your own stories on that because you know what happened: They didn’t want to spend the money.\\xa0 But we did.\\n\\nTo date, we’ve facilitated the supply of more than 38 million N95 masks nationwide.\\xa0 This week, we’ll be sending 2 million N95 masks to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\\xa0 The Vice President will go into more detail.\\xa0 He’s got great detail on that, and I think it’s a pretty amazing story.\\xa0 We have a lot of masks already in stock, and we have more coming.\\n\\nWe’re further expanding hospital surge capacity in key areas of the opening, and we have a portion of certain VA hospitals and non-veteran coronavirus patients, including at the East Orange, New Jersey Medical Center, as well as facilities in Manhattan and Brooklyn. \\xa0They’re ready.\\xa0 They’re able.\\xa0 They’re beautiful.\\xa0 Hopefully, we won’t need too many of them because, frankly, we built everything that the governors wanted.\\xa0 And in many cases, it’s too much.\\xa0 We told them it was too much, but we wanted to err on the side of caution.\\n\\nThe United States has now conducted nearly 3 million tests for the virus.\\xa0 Three million — the most of any nation.\\xa0 We are performing approximately 150,000 tests every single day and our rate of testing is especially high in areas hardest hit by the virus, if you look.\\xa0 And that’s really — and it has hit some areas — the virus — very, very hard.\\xa0 For example, per capita testing in New York is higher than the rest of the world.\\n\\nThe NIH, CDC, and FDA are also currently validating several antibody tests that will allow us to determine whether someone has already had the virus and potentially become immune to infection.\\xa0 We’re looking at that.\\xa0 The antibody tests are going to be very interesting, over the next short while.\\xa0 A lot of things are being developed, as we speak.\\n\\nIn the race to develop effective treatments, the drug company Gilead announced that its drug, remdesivir, has shown promising results — very promising — in compassionate use settings.\\xa0 In addition, the FDA has just granted emergency use authorization for a device that removes certain proteins from the bloodstream, possibly preventing a patient’s immune system from overreacting to the virus and damaging vital organs, which is a big problem.\\n\\nFurthermore, over the last seven days, my administration has deployed roughly 28 million doses of hydroxychloroquine from our National Stockpile.\\xa0 We have millions of doses that we bought and many people are using it all over the country.\\xa0 And just recently, a friend of mine told me he got better because of the use of that — that drug.\\xa0 So, who knows?\\xa0 And you combine it with Z-Pak, you combine it with Zinc — depending on your doctor’s recommendation.\\xa0 And it’s having some very good results, I’ll tell you.\\n\\nI think if anybody recommended it other than me, it would be used all over the place, to be honest with you.\\xa0 I think the fact that I recommended it, I probably set it back a lot.\\xa0 But it’s a lot of good things that are happening with it.\\xa0 A lot of good tests.\\n\\nScientists are also pursuing a blood therapy known as convalescent plasma.\\xa0 Convalescent plasma.\\xa0 This therapy uses antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to treat those who are sick.\\xa0 And this is something that actually is a very old procedure, but it’s done in a very modern way.\\n\\nDuring this difficult time, we’re also working to ensure that the 2020 Census is completed safely and accuracy.\\xa0\\xa0 We may be asking for an extension because, obviously, they can’t be doing very much right now.\\xa0 They wouldn’t even be allowed to do it.\\xa0 So, the Census, we’re going to be asking for a delay — a major delay, I think.\\xa0 How can you possibly be knocking on doors for a long period of time now?\\n\\nThe Census Bureau recently made the decision to temporarily suspend its field operation data-collection activities to help stop the spread.\\xa0 In addition, while millions of Americans continue to complete their questionnaire online, the Census Bureau has asked Congress for a 120 extension.\\xa0 I don’t know that you even have to ask them.\\xa0 This is called “an act of God.”\\xa0 This is called a — a situation that has to be — they have to give in.\\xa0 I think 120 days isn’t nearly enough.\\n\\nMy administration is also taking bold action to help American workers.\\xa0 On Friday, Americans began receiving the cash payments authorized by a historic $2 trillion relief bill.\\n\\nBy the end of the week, nearly 80 million Americans will receive a total of $147 billion.\\xa0 And from what the Secretary of the Treasury tells me, that’s very much on time and going very nicely.\\xa0 He’ll be speaking in a moment.\\xa0 And payments — these payments go directly into the banks and the bank accounts of these people.\\xa0 Millions of additional payments will follow.\\xa0 The typical family of four will receive $3,400.\\xa0 That’s for a family of four.\\xa0 That’s something.\\n\\nAdditionally, through our Paycheck Protection Program –which is a tremendous success, and they should extend it and increase it.\\xa0 This has been a tremendous success.\\xa0 So successful that the banks are taking a little bit longer to distribute the money, but it’s going rapidly.\\n\\nWe’ve now processed over $200 billion in loans to help small businesses retain their workers.\\xa0 Now we urgently need lawmakers to set aside the partisan agendas and to replenish this program with new funds because it’s really something that has been an incredible success.\\xa0 And they need more money to keep it going to take care of these business and keep them — keep them open.\\n\\nI want to thank the many governors, health professionals, scientists, and business leaders for their incredible hard work and input over the past month, and even long beyond a month, Mike, I would say.\\xa0 You know, we’ve been working together with a lot of for, it seems like, forever.\\n\\nI’ve been having many discussions with my team and top experts, and we’re very close to completing a plan to open our country, hopefully even ahead of schedule.\\xa0 And that’s so important.\\n\\nWe will soon finalize new and very important guidelines to give governors the information they need to start safely opening their states.\\xa0 My administration’s plan and corresponding guidelines will give the American people the confidence they need to begin returning to normal life.\\xa0 That’s what we want.\\xa0 We want to have our country open.\\xa0 We want to return to normal life.\\xa0 Our country is going to be open, and it’s going to be successfully opened.\\xa0 And we’ll be explaining over a very short number of days exactly what is going to be.\\n\\nWe’ve also, as you probably heard, developed a committee.\\xa0 We’re actually calling it a number of committees with the most prominent people in the country, the most successful people in the various fields.\\xa0 And we’ll be announcing them tomorrow.\\n\\nThis weekend, the United States also helped facilitate an unprecedented agreement among the 23 nations of OPEC Plus — that’s OPEC plus additional energy-producing nations — representing many of the world’s largest oil-producing countries to stabilize oil markets.\\xa0 And we have, in fact — and I think you’ve seen a big stabilization over the last couple of days.\\n\\nTogether, countries around the world will cut oil production by approximately 20 million barrels.\\xa0 People are saying 10 million, but we think that the number that they’ll actually hit is going to be closer to 20 million barrels a day.\\xa0 And that will help a lot with saving jobs all over Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and many of other — other of our big energy states.\\n\\nThis historic action will help nearly 11 million American workers who are supported by the U.S. oil and gas industry.\\xa0 It’s a very monumental agreement.\\xa0 I want to thank Saudi Arabia and the King of Saudi Arabia, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia — both.\\xa0 I want to thank President Putin of Russia.\\xa0 And I want to thank a very good friend of mine — a man who’s become a friend of mine: The President of Mexico showed great flexibility.\\xa0 President López Obrador.\\xa0 He showed great flexibility and — and tremendous intelligence doing what he did.\\xa0 It was not that easy for him.\\xa0 And I want to thank Mexico and the president.\\xa0 This is a very historic deal.\\xa0 Very historic.\\xa0 So we’ll see how it all goes.\\n\\nIn this time and challenge — and we are certainly in a time probably like we haven’t been in many, many decades — we are strengthened and sustained by the bonds of love and loyalty that unite all Americans.\\xa0 I’m so proud of the American people.\\n\\nEverywhere you look, you see the patriotism of our people shining through and the courage of our doctors and nurses on the frontlines, and the dedication of our food supply workers, and in the commitment of every citizen to achieving victory over the virus.\\xa0 That’s what’s going to happen.\\xa0 It’s going to happen sooner than people think.\\xa0 And we’re going to be smart about it.\\xa0 Very, very smart about it.\\xa0 We’re going to be safe about it.\\xa0 We’re going to be listening also to the great doctors and medical professionals.\\n\\nTogether, we’re beating back the invisible enemy and we’re paving the way for great resurgence.\\xa0 Really, a great resurgence for American prosperity.\\xa0 Our country wants to go back.\\xa0 They want to go back to work.\\xa0 They’re going to go back safely, and that’s what we want.\\n\\nI’d like now to ask Vice President Pence to say a few words, followed by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx.\\xa0 I think before we — before we do this — because I know there’s an emergency where they want Steve to come.\\xa0 So what I’ll do is I’ll ask Steve to come up — Secretary of the Treasury.\\xa0 You can talk a little bit and then maybe take a couple of questions about what’s happening.\\xa0 Tell them the success we’re having.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 As you announced, we are very pleased that we are ahead of schedule on delivering the economic impact payments.\\xa0 These are what was known as the checks in the mail that we want to deliver in direct — direct deposit.\\n\\nThis is ahead of schedule.\\xa0 We started processing those last Friday.\\xa0 We expect that over 80 million hardworking Americans will get the direct deposit by this Wednesday.\\xa0 And we know how important that is to all of those hardworking Americans, many of which are at home, not working at the moment.\\n\\nIf you do not receive them by Wednesday — on Wednesday, we will be launching at IRS.gov.\\xa0 Click on IRS.gov, go to “Get Your Payment.”\\xa0 If you filed a tax return in 2018 and ’19 — or ’19 — have that information available.\\xa0 You’ll be able to ID yourself, you’ll be able to put in your direct deposit information, and within several days, we will automatically deposit the money into your account.\\xa0 We want to do as much of this electronically as we can.\\xa0 It’s very important in this day and age.\\xa0 It’s more secure, and you don’t have to go to the bank.\\n\\nIf you’re a Social Security beneficiary, you do not need to do anything.\\xa0 You will get a direct deposit.\\xa0 If you have not filed and did not need to file a 2018 and ‘19 return, you can go to IRS.gov now and enter your information and authenticate yourself.\\xa0 So again, we are very pleased that that is ahead of schedule.\\n\\nI’d also like to announce the progress we’re making on the new SBA program, the PPP.\\xa0 Let me just remind everybody: This is a brand-new program that is now one week old.\\n\\nWe have distributed and confirmed $230 billion of loans to over 4,600 lenders participating.\\xa0 That is multiples and multiples of anything that the SBA has ever done in — in one year, before.\\xa0 And I especially want to thank the broad-based community banks that are participating.\\xa0 Again, over 4,600 banks.\\n\\nIf you haven’t had your loan processed, you will get it processed this week.\\xa0 As the President said, we’ve gone back to Congress and asked them for more money to make sure that every business has access to this.\\n\\nLet me also comment for the states.\\xa0 We are distributing out half the money, this week, to the states.\\xa0 That’s a week ahead of time.\\xa0 And we’ll deliver the other half of the money to the states next week.\\n\\nAnd then let me just finally comment, we’ve been very — working very closely with the Federal Reserve.\\xa0 Last week, we announced expanded facilities and new facilities that total $2.3 trillion of liquidity.\\xa0 And in particular, I’d just like to highlight a Main Street lending facility that will be for companies between one worker and 10,000 people — so mid-sized businesses — and also, a municipal facility for states and local governments to be able to access funds given the shortages that they have.\\n\\nSo with that, I’m happy to answer any questions\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You have any questions for Steve, please?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Secretary Mnuchin, thank you, sir.\\xa0 Both Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer have said that they’re in negotiations with you right now on additional funding for these small-business loans, for that package.\\xa0 Leader McConnell, though, has said that nothing should be added to the package.\\xa0 They should just be specific to small-business loans.\\xa0 What is the opinion of your administration?\\xa0 Should there be some sort of horse-trading here or should it just be small business loans?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, the President’s view and the Vice President’s and my view is this was a bipartisan program.\\xa0 This SBA program, it wasn’t a Republican program, it wasn’t a Democrat program; it was a bipartisan program.\\xa0 We’ve committed to small businesses.\\xa0 We should top up that program now.\\xa0 I know the Democrats want to talk about more money for hospitals and states.\\xa0 Right now, we’re just sending the money out to the hospitals and states.\\xa0 They haven’t come close to using that money.\\xa0 And I know the President and Vice Presidents have said once we get the SBA done, we can go into another funding bill.\\n\\nThe President has talked about potentially adding infrastructure and other things.\\xa0 We think there is a likelihood we will need more money, and we will — we will sit down and try to get a bipartisan bill.\\xa0 But this is important we deliver on small businesses.\\xa0 Fifty percent of the people work for small businesses.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What’s the emergency that the President said you had to go for?\\xa0 The President said you had an emergency meeting —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Negotiation.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Over this bill?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Yeah, well — or because we don’t want to run out of money.\\xa0 We’ve used about $220 billion of the $350 billion.\\xa0 We don’t want to run out of that money.\\xa0 We don’t want to create panics that people won’t get it.\\xa0 So that’s why we want to — we want to top that up, and we’ve asked for another $250 billion for that program.\\n\\nAnd again, let me just remind you, every dollar we spend in this program, we save a dollar of unemployment insurance.\\xa0 So even though we’re asking for $250 billion, it really won’t cost that much.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Could I follow up?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What are your — do you have concerns about lifting the guidelines too soon?\\xa0 And what’s the economic impact?\\xa0 I understand the economic argument for getting people back to work, obviously.\\xa0 But what’s the economic risk of lifting them too early and seeing then a spike in cases again?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, of course there’s economic risks in both directions.\\xa0 We reviewed with the President today a very broad list of over 100 business people that are going to help advise the President on what needs to be done to reopen the economy.\\n\\nWe want to make sure — and again, the combination of economic impact payments, small-business payments, enhanced unemployment insurance — the President made very clear, we want to make sure that hardworking Americans have liquidity while we wait to reopen the government.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So do you believe the government should be re- — or that the country, excuse me, should be reopened on May 1?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 I’ve had discussions with the President.\\xa0 I know he’s considering it, and I believe he’s going to make a decision later in the week.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We have to do — everything has to be safe.\\xa0 We want safe.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What is your advice to the President?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 My advice is: As soon as it’s ready to open and based upon the medical professionals, and — and again, we’re working very closely with the President and outside business leaders to develop a plan.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I just wonder — I wanted to ask you, Mr. President, what you think — what — if you could sketch for us what reopening the economy looks like.\\xa0 Do you think it’s going to be everything open?\\xa0 Or do you think —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I’ll be doing that over the next few days because we’ll probably be making a statement about that and exactly what it looks like.\\n\\nI know what that looks like, but I also want to get the advice, in a sense.\\xa0 We have some of the — the biggest from every business on this council.\\xa0 We’re actually setting up a number of different councils or committees, I guess you could call them.\\xa0 And we have a lot of smart people.\\xa0 I think that they will give us some also good advice.\\xa0 But, no, we want to be very, very safe.\\xa0 At the same time, we got to get our country open.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, I understand that, Mr. President.\\xa0 Do you think there is a possibility then that what you do is you open it incrementally?\\xa0 Do you think people will go back to restaurants, to concerts, the cinema?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I do think so.\\xa0 Eventually, they will.\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And let me ask one final —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think eventually they\\xa0will do that.\\xa0 And I think we’re going to — boom — I think we’re going to — I think it’s going to go quickly.\\xa0 Our people want to get back to work, and I think there’s a pent-up demand like there hasn’t been in a long time.\\n\\nAnd that’s why — and that’s why you see the stock market — I mean, to think that the stock market is at the level it is right now, with all that this world and this country has gone.\\xa0 And look at the European Union, how badly decimated they’ve been.\\xa0 Look at other countries.\\xa0 Look at China, by the way.\\xa0 I’ve seen the numbers.\\xa0 Look at China.\\xa0 Look at how these countries have been just decimated by this.\\n\\nAnd to think that the stock market is at this tremendously high number.\\xa0 Not that much — you know, it was looking a little bleak for a while, but it — it hit a certain point and then started going up.\\xa0 I think that’s a great tribute to the fact that there’s a demand.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, thank you, sir.\\xa0 In regards to some of your tweets earlier today, and I think it was Steve’s question, my question to you is: What provision in the Constitution gives the President the power to open or close state economies?\\xa0 And then —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Numerous provisions.\\xa0 We’ll give you a legal brief if you want.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And then — we’ll be looking forward to that, sir.\\xa0 But following up: What happens if you say, for instance, “We want states to reopen but California or New York do not open”?\\xa0 What would you do then?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think everybody wants to open.\\xa0 I mean, I guess, you know, that could happen, but I don’t think that would happen.\\n\\nGo ahead please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s been states that have closed, ordered schools closed.\\xa0 It’s been states that have ordered businesses like restaurants and bars closed.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s because I let that happen because I would have preferred that.\\xa0 I let that happen.\\xa0 But if I wanted to, I could have closed it up.\\xa0 But I let that happen and I like the way they’ve done it.\\xa0 And the seven that remained really in sort of a semi-lockdown — if you look at those states, they’ve really done a very good job.\\xa0 They’re very much different from a New York or from other places where they’ve been hit very hard.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you’re prepared then to bigfoot states and say, “I order you to open your schools, I order to force kids to be able to go”?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, Mr. President.\\xa0 Following up on that, there are two consortiums of states today — California, Oregon, and Washington on the West Coast; Northeastern states — totally representing about 100 million people, who have said they’re going to cooperate and decide when to reopen those states.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they can decide, but —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Does that undermine what you’re trying to do?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, not at all.\\xa0 Let me just tell you — very simple.\\xa0 I’m going to put it very simply: The President of the United States has the authority to do what the President has the authority to do, which is very powerful.\\xa0 The President of the United States calls the shots.\\n\\nIf we weren’t here for the states, you would have had a problem in this country like you’ve never seen before.\\xa0 We were here to back them up.\\xa0 And we’re backing — and we’ve more than backed them up.\\xa0 We did a job that nobody ever thought was possible.\\xa0 It’s a decision for the President of the United States.\\n\\nNow, with that being said, we’re going to work with the states because it’s very important.\\xa0 You have local governments, they’re pinpointed.\\xa0 It’s really — you talk about — it’s like a microchip.\\xa0 They are pinpointed.\\xa0 We have local government that hopefully will do a good job.\\xa0 And if they don’t do a good job, I’d step in so fast.\\xa0 But no, they can’t do anything without the approval of the President of the United States.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But, Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So if some states refuse to reopen and you order them to, the 10th Amendment of the Constitution says all powers that don’t reside in the President or Congress reside in the states.\\xa0 How do you overcome that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, if some states refuse to open, I would be — I would like to see that person run for election.\\xa0 They’re going to open.\\xa0 They’re going to all open.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So that’s a valid (inaudible).\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think that’s something that’s not going to happen.\\xa0 They want to open.\\xa0 They have to open.\\xa0 They have to get open.\\xa0 Every one of those states, the people want to go and they want to —\\n\\nNow, some will be — are in a different situation.\\xa0 You have — I won’t name states now, but I will over the next two or three days.\\xa0 I’m going to be very specific.\\xa0 But you have some states where this is not the kind of a problem than it is in New York or Louisiana or Michigan or other places that got hit very hard.\\xa0 Illinois got hit very hard.\\xa0 But all states want to open and they want to open as soon as possible.\\xa0 But they want to open safely and so do I.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Today, the French President Emmanuel Macron said that he will keep the shutdown in France until the middle of May.\\xa0 Does that mean that the U.S. will keep the ban from flights from —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, France got hit very hard.\\xa0 France got hit very hard.\\xa0 And again, he has to do what he has to do.\\xa0 He’s a friend of mine.\\xa0 But France — Spain has just been decimated.\\xa0 You look at what’s happened in Italy, it’s a very well-known fact, what happened in Italy.\\xa0 No, they were hit very hard.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Question for Secretary Mnuchin: Has everybody that you would like to have — the 100 business people on the Economic Council — have they all been invited already? \\xa0Have they all agreed to be —\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 They ha- — they haven’t been invited yet.\\xa0 We’ve just reviewed the names with the President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s a group.\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 — today, for him to sign off on.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And are they from all sectors?\\xa0 Energy —\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Yes, there’s — basically, there’s verticals.\\xa0 So every single area of the economy we wanted to be represented.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Great.\\xa0 One other thing.\\xa0 Is there anything else that needs to be done to work on industry — oil industry jobs — to save oil industry jobs after the deal this past weekend?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, I think there’s always things.\\xa0 So we’re working with Larry Kudlow.\\xa0 I mean, we have —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Anything specifically that needs to be done?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 We have — we have economic plans for every single part of the economy.\\xa0 Obviously, in the case of the oil industry, they’ve been hit especially hard because you’ve had both the supply issue and you’ve had the demand issue.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have you — have you figured out the bailout money for the airlines, with the allocations for the airlines?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 So I’m pleased to say we’ve worked very hard.\\xa0 I think, as you probably have seen, we’ve put out a press release that we have now had discussions with almost all the airlines.\\xa0 I’ve personally had discussions with all the major airlines’ CEOs.\\xa0 We specifically created an exception for small airlines that we could process very quickly.\\xa0 And I think you’ll see, very quickly, decisions coming out.\\xa0 I’m very pleased with the discussions we’ve had.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’ve had very good dis- — really just good discussions.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Secretary?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you still see a need for a phase four stimulus?\\xa0 Or is this push to reopen —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Steve, I just want to say we have had —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — the economy in lieu of that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — discussions — wait, excuse me.\\xa0 One second, please.\\xa0 We’ve had very good discussions with the airlines.\\xa0 Very good discussions.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And is it possible to reopen the economy on May the 1st?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t want to say that.\\xa0 You’ll be hearing over the next few days.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is phase four going to be later than that, Mr. President?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0\\xa0 Let me — let me just comment — I’m going to answer your question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Secretary, do you see a need for a phase four?\\xa0 Or is this push in lieu of another stimulus?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 So again, let me just comment — I mean, Congress, on a bipartisan basis, approved an unprecedented amount of money to help American workers and American business because it was no fault of their own that business was closed down.\\xa0 We had been very diligently executing on that.\\xa0 You know, everybody said it was going to take months to get people money.\\xa0 We are executing very quickly.\\xa0 We created a whole new SBA program in a week.\\n\\nOur job right now is to execute the $2.3 billion, which we can add several trillion dollars with the Fed.\\n\\nThe one area we are particularly concerned about is the Small Business program.\\xa0 Quite frankly, it’s even more incredibly popular and successful than we anticipated.\\xa0 So the President wants to be very clear: We have money for that.\\xa0 And once we get done with that, we will review with the President.\\xa0 If there is more money that needs to be — to support this economy, to support hardworking Americans — we will work with Congress to get that in time.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And, Steve, do you want to talk about phase four?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 So, phase four, the President has talked about infrastructure for a long period of time.\\xa0 We’ve talked about — to the extent that the hospitals need more money because of the medical issues, we’ll monitor that.\\xa0 We want to make sure there are incentives for restaurants, entertainment — people to get back to those types of things.\\xa0 So we’ll be looking at, very specifically, provisions to stimulate parts of the economy.\\xa0 Some of them may be money issues.\\xa0 Some of them may be regulatory issues.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, just to clarify your understanding of your authority vis-à-vis governors — just to be very specific: For instance, if a governor issued a stay-at-home order —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 When you say “my authority” — the President’s authority.\\xa0 Not mine, because it’s not me.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If I could just ask the question —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 This is — when somebody is the President of the United States, the authority is total, and that’s the way it’s got to be.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s total?\\xa0 Your authority is total?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s total.\\xa0 It’s total.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Your authority is total?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And the governors know that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So if a governor —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The governors know that.\\xa0 No, you have —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If a governor issues a stay-at-home order, you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — a couple of bands of — excuse me.\\xa0 Excuse me.\\xa0 You have a couple —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Could you rescind that?\\xa0 Could you rescind that order?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You have a couple of bands of Democrat governors, but they will agree to it.\\xa0 They will agree to it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What if it was a Republican governor?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But the authority of the President of the United States, having to do with the subject we’re talking about, is total.\\n\\nYeah, please, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, one of the things you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 One of the things you — one of the things you spoke — we saw in your video about was the travel ban from Europe.\\xa0 As part of reopening America, do you want to reopen the borders so that people from Europe, from the UK —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 At the right time.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How soon do you think we are from —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And a very good question, actually.\\n\\nWell, I’m going to have to take a look.\\xa0 I wouldn’t say Italy is doing great right now, and I wouldn’t say Spain is doing great right now.\\xa0 And we just heard that France is extending its stay-inside order, right?\\xa0 Their stay — they’ve extended it — I just see that — and, I think, for a short period of time.\\n\\nBut no, when they’re back.\\xa0 We want to do it very quickly, but we want to make sure everything is good.\\n\\nNo, right now we have a very —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Weeks, months?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Right now we have a very strong ban.\\xa0 We’re going to keep it that way until they heal.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Weeks, months?\\xa0 What would you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I can’t tell you that.\\xa0 I can’t tell you that.\\xa0 I have to see: How are they doing?\\xa0 I mean, France just went for another two days — for another two weeks.\\xa0 We have to see.\\n\\nJon.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So Dr. Fauci said that you took his advice on the question of mitigation.\\xa0 He made the recommendation.\\xa0 You accepted it.\\xa0 You put into place.\\xa0 As you make this next decision, which, as you have said —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I’m not sure who — Jon, I’m not sure who really gave me advice on the ban.\\xa0 I think I took —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No, not on the ban.\\xa0 I’m talking about the mitigation.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think I took my own advice on the ban.\\xa0 I don’t know.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — the social — the social distancing, I’m talking about.\\xa0 The shutting down.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Not of travel, but of activity.\\xa0 So my question is: As you make this next decision, which you have said may be the most difficult or important decision of your presidency, will you assure the American people that you will again take the advice of the doctors — of Dr. Fauci, of Dr. Birx?\\xa0 Will you take the advice of the health experts before you do that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I will and many other people also.\\xa0 But I will absolutely take their advice.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But would you go against them?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, Mr. —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Would you go against their recommendation?\\xa0 If they say you need another 15 or 30 days, would you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t think it would be likely because I think we’re not very far from being on the same page.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, Mr. President, one thing that Governor Cuomo said today is that states do not have the capacity to do the mass COVID-19 testing ahead of a reopening as —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they have to do it.\\xa0 Look, they’re supposed to be doing it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 He says he can’t purchase the diagnostic tests or equipment —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I know.\\xa0 I know.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and needs federal help.\\xa0 So will the states get that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they — they may need help, but —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Will they get it?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But they’re there.\\xa0 They’re on ground.\\xa0 They’ve got local mayors, local representatives.\\xa0 They have people that do it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But he needs the supplies.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And what we did last time is unprecedented.\\xa0 We literally rebuilt tests.\\xa0 We — we rebuilt a whole industry because we inherited nothing.\\xa0 What we inherited from the previous administration was totally broken, which somebody should eventually say.\\xa0 Not only were the cupboards bare, as I say, but we inherited broken testing.\\xa0 Now we have great testing.\\n\\nI just left the top executives at Abbott.\\xa0 Who would have thought that would have happened, where they have such a great test as that?\\n\\nAnd, in fact, what I’ll do — I think, unless you have any further questions for the Secretary of the Treasury — do you have anybody for Steve?\\xa0 Anybody?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Secretary Mnuchin —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Is that for the Secretary of the Treasury or for me?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 For Secretary Mnuchin, yeah.\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Because if it’s for me, we can wait.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s for Secretary Mnuchin.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We have to get him back to work, okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\xa0 For Secretary Mnuchin, a question —\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — from one of my colleagues who’s not able to be in the room.\\xa0 They’re curious about the SBA rule that prevents small casinos from getting some of this relief.\\xa0 Is that something that you’re taking a look at?\\xa0 Is there going to be a change to the —\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 So, no — not small casinos, but there are such things as small taverns and restaurants that have literally, you know, small gaming things.\\xa0 And we are coming out with some additional guidance on that.\\xa0 But I want to be clear: It’s not small casinos.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Secretary Mnuchin?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Secretary?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There was a letter that some House Republicans sent this weekend, about the liquidity for a mortgage servicers.\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are — can you explain what you’re looking at on that front?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 So I think I commented on this a week or so ago.\\xa0 We had a subcommittee task force at FSOC that specifically studied this issue.\\xa0 We have all the appropriate people on it.\\xa0 Ginnie Mae has automatically taken some action.\\xa0 We’ve had conversations with the FHFA as to what they’re going to do for Fannie and Freddie.\\xa0 And we’ve said that to the extent they need certain authorities from the Treasury, we will accommodate that.\\n\\nSo we’re — we’re very aware of the issue.\\xa0 Quite frankly, we’ve been studying this issue way before COVID and had concerns about some of these non-bank servicers not being well capitalized.\\xa0 But we’re going to — we’re going to make sure that the market functions properly.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 We have seen, in a number of these relief bills, that Democrats and Republicans have been able to push forward different non-coronavirus-specific funding priorities.\\xa0 Are you trying to keep funding specific to coronavirus?\\xa0 And then, if there are going to be other additions — for instance, a change to labor rules is something that many on the left wanted.\\xa0 Some of the right are wondering if they should also — if you should also be pushing for, you know, their preferred add-ons.\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, I think our expectation has always been this is COVID related.\\xa0 Some people have a rather broad view of what “COVID related” is, because it has impacted almost every single business.\\xa0 I mean, I think, we’ve — the President has talked about the Kennedy Center, which is a good institution.\\xa0 Obviously, that was not the major priority in the bill, but they were hit with COVID related.\\n\\nSo — but, no, the President has instructed we want to be very specific in the next bill.\\xa0 It’s COVID-related items.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s been reported —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we didn’t want to do the Kennedy Center, just so you understand.\\xa0 And that that was done — the Democrats wanted it in.\\xa0 We didn’t want that, but they wanted it in.\\xa0 And we had to agree in order to get something done for the workers.\\xa0 But we want this to be for the workers and for companies that employ the workers.\\xa0 That’s what we’re looking for.\\xa0 We’re not looking for extraneous nonsense.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s been reported that you argued, at the time the China ban was being discussed, that that was too disruptive to the global economy.\\xa0 Is that accurate?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Let me be clear: I had nothing to do with the China ban.\\xa0 I wasn’t on the task force at the time.\\xa0 I’m not even sure I was — I think I was traveling at the time.\\xa0 But I never had any — I was not part — I did become very active, and after the China ban, but that report in the New York Times was not accurate.\\n\\nQ \\xa0\\xa0 You did not weigh in beforehand?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 I was not part of the task force at that time, and I was — I was not involved.\\xa0 As a matter of fact, I think I may have been traveling.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Secretary Mnuchin, there’s a proposal made by Senator Hawley to get direct payments to employers to pay people who have been laid off and to keep people on payroll.\\xa0 Does the administration support that proposal?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, again, that is the PPP.\\xa0 The PPP is basically sending money to small business — 50 percent of American workers — to keep those people paid.\\xa0 And it’s the most efficient way.\\xa0 Every dollar, as I said, we do through that, it’s one less dollar of unemployment.\\xa0 And more importantly, we want those people to have — be associated with the business.\\xa0 So as soon as the President is ready to open up the economy, those businesses are together.\\xa0 We don’t want those businesses to fall apart.\\xa0 That’s why this is such a successful program, and we want Congress to put more money in.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But are you talking about unemployment?\\xa0 You’re talking about the unemployment?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible) Senator Hawley.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sending it indirectly to the states?\\xa0\\xa0 We would have preferred that it was sent directly to the people.\\xa0 The Democrats wanted it to be sent through the unemployment system.\\xa0 And, you know, I’ve talked to you about it: We have 40-year-old equipment in many of those systems.\\xa0 They’re run by the state.\\xa0 But I’m hearing they’re getting the money out anyway.\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 So, some — some of them are, and some of the states aren’t, and we encourage — you know, we’re working with the states to try to update their computers, but it’s a — it’s a long haul.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 Thank you, Steve.\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Phase four, Steve.\\xa0 Phase four.\\xa0 Come on, Steve.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A quick question about something you just said.\\xa0 You said, “When someone is President of the United States, their authority is total.”\\xa0 That is not true.\\xa0 Who — who told you that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 So you know what we’re going to do?\\xa0 We’re going to write up papers on this.\\xa0 It’s not going to be necessary, because the governors need us one way or the other, because ultimately it comes with the federal government.\\xa0 That being said, we’re getting along very well with the governors, and I feel very certain that there won’t be a problem.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Has any governor agreed that you have the authority to decide when their state opens back up?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I haven’t asked anybody because I don’t — you know why?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Because no one has — no one has said that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Because I don’t have to.\\n\\nGo ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But who told you the President has the total authority?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Enough.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You mentioned the Vice President’s call with the governors today.\\xa0 Governor Hogan of Maryland has urged your administration to ask Congress for $500 billion to help stabilize budgetary shortfalls created by coronavirus.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s nice of Governor Hogan, very much.\\xa0 We appreciate Governor Hogan’s statement.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Governor Cuomo said the CARES Act ignored state government shortfalls.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Cuomo.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you support that request?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Which one?\\xa0 What did he say?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 He said the CARES Act ignored the budgetary shortfalls.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they’re looking at things in phase four, where they have — you know, where they talk about states, and they’re also talking about hospitals.\\xa0 They’re talking about states who have been battered, and they’re also talking about hospitals.\\xa0 And we’re certainly willing to look at that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Will you urge Congress on their behalf?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You know, we’ll see what we all come back with.\\xa0 But they are talking about states and they’re talking about hospitals.\\n\\nOAN.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 The Governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, has on Thursday signed an executive order banning the sale of non-essential goods.\\xa0 If other states follow —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The sale of what?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Non-essential goods.\\xa0 She has banned the sale of non-essential goods.\\xa0 Many are calling this draconian, unconstitutional.\\xa0 As President, do you think that if other states were to follow her example in the coming weeks, that the federal government should intervene?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I don’t think that’s going to happen.\\xa0 I think it’s very extreme.\\xa0 But she’s doing it, and I think it’s going to be over a long way before we have to start thinking about it too much.\\xa0 It is strong.\\xa0 It’s a very strong position to take.\\xa0 But they’re making a lot of progress in Michigan, so let’s see how it all works.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What is the status of the funding for the World Health Organization?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re going to be talking about that very soon.\\xa0 I’m getting a full report.\\xa0 I’m not happy with the World Health Organization.\\xa0 I’m not happy with the World Trade Organization either.\\xa0 We’ve been ripped off by everybody.\\n\\nAnd we have — this country, for so many years, has been ripped off by everybody, whether it’s a World Health or World Trade.\\xa0 And they’re like — I call them the “Bobbsey Twins.”\\xa0 They’d look at our country — for years and years, we had people that did nothing about it.\\xa0 We’re doing a lot about it.\\xa0 So we’ll have a report.\\n\\nAnd we’ll also — we’re also talking about the World Trade Organization.\\xa0 But we’ve made a lot of progress there.\\xa0 We’re now winning cases for the first time, because they know I’ll leave if we don’t get treated fairly.\\n\\nThis country — our country — was at a point where we rarely, if ever, won the lawsuits within the World Trade Organization.\\xa0 But now we’re winning a lot of them, because they know I’m not — I’m not playing games.\\xa0 We will pull out if we have to.\\xa0 We just won a 7-billion-dollar lawsuit, which was very nice.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you expect a decision this week on cutting funding for the WHO?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Uh, yeah.\\xa0 I would say, by the end of the week, I’m going to make a decision on that.\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 There’s a lot of — right now, there’s a lot of things happening.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On China — why are there no consequences for China, for the misinformation that they shared?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 How do you know there are no consequences?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Because you’ve said.\\xa0 Well, you’ve been asked, and it appear that there were no —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 How do you know there are no consequences?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What are the consequences, Mr. President, for the misinformation —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I wouldn’t tell you.\\xa0 China will find out. Why would I tell you?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But people are concerned that they stonewalled, that they gave misinformation —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, you started off by saying, “Why are there no consequences?”\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Because you’ve been asked this a few times, so I’m following up on your response.\\xa0 Why are there no consequences for China?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 How do you know there are no consequences?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Because we’ve asked you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You’re going to find out.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and you’ve said — you’ve said that didn’t want to have an consequences because you suggested trade.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I wouldn’t tell you.\\xa0 You’d probably be the last person on Earth I’d tell.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you’re saying there will be consequences?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Uh, yeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President — actually, this is a question for Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 Do you agree with the President’s statement and his understanding of federalism, that his power is total — like in the way he described it?\\xa0 Is there anything you’d like to add or any context you’d like to add to the way he was discussing that?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I support the President’s leadership under the national emergency declaration that he signed.\\n\\nAnd we’re standing before you today, the first time in American history, when all 50 states have issued emergency declarations, and the territories.\\xa0 This is an unprecedented time in the life of the nation.\\n\\nAnd fortunately, as the President has reflected and our health experts will continue to reflect, because the American people have heeded the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America; because state governors have taken those and implemented them, even in states where there was not a significant outbreak; and implemented additional measures as we provided them with data about cases and best practices — we’re making real progress as a country.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But it sounds like you think his power is a little bit more circumscribed than totally.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, make no mistake about it: In the long history of this country, the authority of the President of the United States during national emergencies is unquestionably plenary.\\xa0 And you can look back through times of war and other national emergencies.\\xa0 And as the President said, we’ll happily brief that.\\n\\nBut in the days ahead, what the President has charged us to do is to work with our health experts.\\xa0 We’re going to bring together an extraordinary group of American business leaders to counsel the President.\\xa0 And then, working with the CDC, we’re going to produce new guidelines, based upon the data, for every state and territory in this nation.\\xa0 We’re going to give them guidance.\\xa0 And, as the President has indicated, we’ll continue to respect the leadership and partnership that we forge with every governor in America.\\n\\nBut this is an unprecedented time.\\xa0 But I have to tell you: When you look at the fact — despite the heartbreaking loss of more than 22,000 Americans — when you look at the fact of what the health experts told us this could be, I think I only can feel a sense of gratitude to the American people, gratitude to the extraordinary team that has counseled this President, the steps that President Trump has taken, the policies that governors have implemented all across America.\\n\\nI mean, we were discussing today, at the task force, that when you look at the European Union as a whole, they have nearly three times the mortality rate that the United States of America has today.\\xa0 And that is a tribute to our extraordinary healthcare workers, their dedication, their tireless work.\\xa0 But it’s also a tribute to the fact that the American people put into practice the mitigation efforts that the President counseled the nation to do on the advice of our best scientists, now more than a month ago, and our hospitals were not overwhelmed and are not overwhelmed at this hour.\\n\\nAnd I have to tell you that standing here today, I couldn’t be more proud to stand alongside this President and to be a part of this team that has served the American people during this challenging hour.\\n\\nAnd I just say to you: To every American looking on, as we see the numbers leveling and maybe even beginning to go down, I just encourage you to keep doing what you’re doing.\\xa0 Because of the sacrifices that Americans and American families have made through these mitigation efforts, you’re saving lives and you’re seeing our nation through this time.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, did the states tell you — you’ve been talking to the governors quite a bit — did those coalitions of states on the West Coast and in the Northeast, did they tell you what they are going to be announcing before they announce it?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Governor Phil Murphy and the governor of Connecticut expressed today that they were going to be speaking on a — and discussing on a regional basis what their recommendations would be.\\xa0 And we assured them today —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Did they alert the White House about that, though, sir?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We assured them today on our conference call with, I think, 48 governors that were with us today for the better part of an hour and a half — we told them that what the President would be producing — has directed to be produced are additional guidelines for the states, certified by the CDC, that would inform those governors and local communities and mayors about the best way forward, based on the unique circumstances that those states and those communities are facing.\\n\\nI think what’s clear is the American people have seen the experience in Washington State, where this really all began for us; and in California; and now, the extraordinary challenges in the Greater New York City area, including New Jersey and Connecticut; the challenges in New Orleans and Louisiana and Detroit, still Chicago, parts of Houston.\\n\\nBut they’re also seeing that, in each one of those cases, that the mitigation efforts are truly working.\\xa0 And so we’ll — we’ll work with those — we’ll work with those states.\\xa0 And in some cases, it’ll make perfect sense for them to work together on a regional basis.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Any idea why they didn’t let you know ahead of time what they were planning?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, you don’t know that.\\xa0 You don’t know that.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But — but the President — the President will be —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You don’t know that.\\xa0 I’m sorry.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m sorry, I didn’t hear your question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, can you tell us?\\xa0 Did they let you know?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You don’t know that.\\xa0 No, you made a statement.\\xa0 You don’t know that.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I didn’t hear your — I didn’t hear your statement.\\xa0 I’m sorry.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And we would — and we would like to have their cooperation.\\xa0 And we are going to have their cooperation.\\xa0 They will cooperate perfectly.\\xa0 Watch.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I — and let me just affirm what the President said.\\xa0 We heard it again today in what I think was our ninth conference call with governors is: I think every American would be proud to see the partnership that this President has forged with governors across the country.\\xa0 I mean, it is an extraordinary statement.\\n\\nAnd you’ll see some data when Admiral Polowczyk gets up in just a few moments, but the flow of resources from around the world that we’ve moved into areas that have faced challenges — I mean, this President has directed us to ensure that every state has what they need, when they need it.\\xa0 And the spirit that I heard again from Republicans and Democrat governors today was reflective of that partnership.\\n\\nAnd as we move forward to the President’s goal of reopening America, we expect the same kind of partnership in the interest of the nation.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 All right, go ahead, with the face mask.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, if you can hear me through the mask —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Barely.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can — can you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I hear you well, actually.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — the — the District of Columbia argues that they were shortchanged in the most recent funding bill because they were treated as a territory instead of as a state.\\xa0 Will that be made right in phase four?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re looking at that certainly.\\xa0 I heard that complaint, but the mayor seems to be very happy with everything we’ve done.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 She was on today.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I mean, she’s actually — and she was on today, saying very good things.\\n\\nOkay, yeah.\\xa0 Go ahead in the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you talked about this being the most difficult decision that you are going to have to take about whether to reopen the economy.\\xa0 I wonder how much it weighs on your mind the thought that if there is a second wave, you’ve reopened the economy and you might have to shut things down again.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It does.\\xa0 And I hope that won’t happen.\\xa0 I certainly hope that won’t happen, but it does weigh on my mind.\\n\\nOkay, in the back, go ahead.\\xa0 You had one.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Okay, thank you.\\xa0 A question for one of my colleagues who wasn’t able to be here.\\xa0 China deployed an aircraft carrier into the South China Chi [sic] — South China Sea this weekend, amid claims by Chinese state media that COVID has reduced U.S. military readiness in the region.\\xa0 What kind of responses are you thinking of?\\xa0 Will you have a response to this action?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 China has their own difficulties.\\xa0 We have a relationship with China that — we’re not happy with certain things that happened over the last period of time, as you know, and I’ve been very explicit on that.\\xa0 But we know all about that.\\n\\nAnd, no, China is — we’ve seen what they did.\\xa0 We’ve seen many other things that they’ve done, both pro and con.\\xa0 And we’ll be just fine.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On Abbott, you said something earlier, where you said that you’re putting together the economic task force and that you thought that the recommendations were happening earlier than expected.\\xa0 Did you mean to suggest that it could be before May 1st that you start recommending that states open?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t want to say that, but we’re going to be putting out guidelines and recommendations fairly quickly.\\xa0 In a few days.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You’re not ruling out that it would be before?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m not going to say.\\xa0 But, look, certain states are doing very well.\\xa0 Certain big parts of the country are doing very well.\\xa0 They’re doing, really, very well.\\xa0 And so we’re going to be putting out recommendations and guidelines very soon.\\n\\nSteve?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And would these new guidelines be — would they fit each area or would they be a uniform set of guidelines?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, you’re going to see.\\xa0 I — I don’t want to tell you now, but right now we have a very strong indication that we know, pretty much — we have some good ideas.\\n\\nI also do want to get — I want to have — we’ll have video conference or at least a conference call with a lot of very good people, having to do with certain fields, whether it’s energy or whether it’s entertainment and restaurants, et cetera, et cetera.\\n\\nWe have to get people back into restaurants.\\xa0 We have to do what we have to do.\\xa0 Whether it’s deductibility or not, we’ll see, but it should be deductibility.\\xa0 You’ll get them back so fast.\\xa0 I mean, they used to have deductibility.\\xa0 The restaurant business, it — it was one of the hot businesses.\\xa0 And then they ended it a long time ago, many years ago.\\xa0 But we may need that to get people back into the restaurants.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Michelle Obama, today, got behind mail-in voting nationwide as a possible solution to the — on states.\\xa0 She said it shouldn’t be a partisan issue.\\xa0 Have your advisors told you that that could save lives?\\xa0 And (inaudible)?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Absentee ballot, are you talking about?\\xa0 Absentee ballot?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, and on a massive scale because of the coronavirus.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I don’t know what she did.\\xa0 I mean, I didn’t see that.\\xa0 When did that happen?\\xa0 Today?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, she’s part of — that’s a nonpartisan group.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I wish her luck.\\xa0 I wish her a lot of luck.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On Abbott Labs, you said you had long —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, Mr. President.\\xa0 There’s a little bit of confusion about your phone calls yesterday with President Putin.\\xa0 The Kremlin is saying that you discussed current issues of ensuring strategic security.\\xa0 That wasn’t referred to in the White House\\nreadout.\\xa0 Can you enlighten us —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We discussed many things.\\xa0 We did discuss China.\\xa0 We discussed many different things, but we — it was primarily a call on the oil, as you can imagine.\\xa0 And they were very helpful in getting a stabilization price, a stabilization of the number of barrels.\\xa0 I think the number is going to be closer to 20 — maybe 15, but closer to 20 than it is going to be to 10.\\xa0 And I think it was a very important call.\\n\\nI also spoke with the King of Saudi Arabia and that was a very important call.\\xa0 And the bottom nine is OPEC Plus.\\xa0 It’s called OPEC Plus because there are other states also, other nations.\\xa0 We came to a very good agreement.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You have —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What was the part about strategic security?\\xa0 Was that —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I would say mostly we were talking about China.\\xa0 We were talking about their borders.\\xa0 And we’re talking about our borders a little bit — our borders with Mexico.\\xa0 Because, as you know, Mexico is a big part of the deal.\\xa0 And Mexico really — it was very complex from the standpoint of Mexico.\\xa0 It was not an easy deal for Mexico.\\xa0 And the President — we appreciated a certain amount of flexibility.\\xa0 But we talked about borders, we talked about China, we talked about Mexico.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But “strategic security” sounds more like arms treaties.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I mean, I — we did talk about the arms.\\xa0 Yes, we did.\\xa0 That was a very important part of the call actually.\\xa0 Yeah, good point.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, on Abbott Labs, you said testing is going great.\\xa0 We know that they have — these machines have been sent to some of the governors, but some of them are saying they don’t have the materials to actually conduct the tests.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they have to get the material.\\xa0 You know, the governors have to get the material.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The cartridges.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Now, if they can’t get it, they’re going to see us.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The government is — the federal government is distributing those cartridges.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m talking about the local governments.\\xa0 I’m talking about governors have to get the material.\\xa0 Now, they have machines.\\xa0 In fact, we — we’re going to go into — I’d ask Mike to go into it as soon as I leave.\\xa0 They have very powerful machines that they don’t know they even have.\\xa0 I’m not talking about Abbott; I’m talking about the governors.\\xa0 They have machines that are used for this —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The hospital labs.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You know what I’m talk- — do you know what I’m referring to?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, they have the two different machines.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Very big, very powerful machines where, in a certain state’s case, they’re only using 10 percent of their capacity and they didn’t know it.\\xa0 That happens to be Illinois.\\n\\nJon, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay, well, real quick.\\xa0 Real quick.\\xa0 These 15-minute tests that you’ve sent out, these new ones that you had in the Rose Garden, they say — including Governor Sununu in New Hampshire — that they don’t have the cartridges to actually conduct the test.\\xa0 So when will they get those cartridges?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 What do you think the answer to that is?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re rapidly — we’re rapidly increasing the numbers, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Rapidly increasing the numbers.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And Deb will speak to (inaudible).\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can we look into when?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Rapidly increases.\\xa0 Well, pretty quickly.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 They can — they can do 50,000 a day, right?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, you have other machines where they can really work.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can they go up beyond that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And a lot of the states have the big machines that can do a lot.\\xa0 They didn’t even know they had them.\\xa0 They didn’t even know that they had them.\\xa0 And Mike is going to be talking about that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And you remember you mentioned, several weeks ago, the — that Google was putting together that website\\nwhere they would handle the drive-through testing?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Google and Apple.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have you — have you given up on —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You mean Google and Apple combination.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have you — have you moved past that, because you said —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 A lot of people don’t like it from the standpoint of constitutional rights.\\xa0 I mean, a lot of people don’t like it and some people think it’s great.\\xa0 No, they are working on that, as I understand.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How about the testing website?\\xa0 Remember you said a website for Google and —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, no, I know that.\\xa0 I know that.\\xa0 I know.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And it’s only operating in, I think, five counties in California right now.\\xa0 Is that —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s right.\\xa0 No, Google is looking at it, but Google is also working with Apple or looking at something.\\xa0 We have the greatest companies in the world looking at things that, in a year from now, everything that we’re looking at now is going to be obsolete. \\xa0That’s how good it is.\\n\\nWe have things happening that are unbelievable.\\xa0 I saw a presentation today that I can’t talk about yet, but it’s incredible.\\xa0 Plus, I think they’re doing — Tony — I think they’re doing very well in the vaccines.\\xa0 They’re working hard on the vaccines and I think you’ll have an answer for vaccines.\\xa0 I believe that there’s some great things coming out with respect to that.\\xa0 Now you need a testing period, but you’re going to have some great things.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, on the contact tracing that Google and Apple are doing — so a different subject, on the contact —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no.\\xa0 This is — this is the Google and Apple.\\xa0 I don’t know if it’s a partnership or what, but they’re working on some —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Correct.\\xa0 So there was the one —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They’re working on more than one element.\\xa0 They’re working on a couple of different things, Google and Apple.\\xa0 Google is also working on something, as you know, having to do with testing.\\xa0 I believe they’re doing that in a singular fashion.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So my question is not about the drive-through testing website.\\xa0 Not that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On Google and Apple’s contact tracing that they want to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — they’ve got this process now where they can put, you know, contact tracing on your phone.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I know.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If you opt in, you can be alerted if you’ve been —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — in contact with someone with the coronavirus.\\xa0 Do you — how do you feel about that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, it’s an amazing thing, but a lot of people have some very big constitutional problems with it.\\xa0 You know that.\\xa0 It’s an amazing thing and it would be — actually, as you know, other countries are thinking about using something similar but not as good.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Which other countries are thinking about something similar?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I hear Singapore is.\\xa0 Singapore is.\\xa0 No, Singapore had a little bit of a setback because they had a –they had a break.\\xa0 You know that, and — but they’ll take care of it.\\xa0 I know — I know the folks in Singapore.\\xa0 They’re doing a great job and they’re going to put it back very quickly.\\xa0 But Singapore and other countries are looking at other things, and some countries are doing other things.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Would you prefer that Americans use some other system?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I don’t want to get into that because we have a whole constitutional thing.\\xa0 We have more of a constitutional problem than a mechanical problem, but we will be making a determination on that.\\xa0 That’s something we’re going to be discussing with a lot of people over the next four weeks.\\xa0 That would be a very accurate way of doing it, but a lot of people have a problem with it.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A testing question, maybe for Dr. Fauci as well.\\xa0 Can you talk about where the antibody test is and how quickly that will be (inaudible)?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it’s moving along.\\xa0 I think I can speak because I — I have to leave.\\xa0 Moving along quickly, moving along well.\\xa0 It’s a test that’s been going along for many, many years, except now we have very modern, very incredible versions of it.\\xa0 But that’s moving on.\\xa0 The antibody test have — moving along very well.\\n\\nOkay, anymore COVID-19?\\xa0 COVID-19?\\n\\nYeah, Steve.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 One soldier on the Theodore Roosevelt has died.\\xa0 Has — have you determined the status of Captain Crozier, the former commander?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, that’s going through the Navy, as I understand it.\\xa0 The Navy is going to be making decisions on all of that.\\xa0 And they had a break in — I don’t think the ship should have been stopping in Vietnam when you have a pandemic, to be honest with you.\\xa0 You know, I don’t think the captain should have been writing letters.\\xa0 He’s not Ernest Hemingway, as I said before, and he shouldn’t have been writing letters.\\n\\nAnd I don’t think — I don’t know who gave the orders to stop in Vietnam.\\xa0 But they stopped in Vietnam and all of a sudden they get on, and now you have over 500 sailors and — and people on the ship that are affected.\\xa0 I don’t know whose idea that was, but that wasn’t such a good idea in the middle of a pandemic.\\n\\nYes, please.\\xa0 Jon.\\xa0 Go ahead, Jon.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just one last — on this question of constitutionality, I’m just wondering what changed your view because —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Nothing changed it.\\xa0 No, no, I know exactly what you’re going to say.\\xa0 Nothing changed it.\\xa0 The fact that I want to rely on states or maybe will or maybe have, and the fact that we’ve gotten on — that’s one thing.\\xa0 The fact that I don’t want to use the power is another thing.\\xa0 Look —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But you said from the standpoint of the Constitution —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes, Constitution.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — you thought it should be up to the governors.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Constitutionally.\\xa0 You can look at constitutionally.\\xa0 You can look at federalism.\\xa0 You can look at it any different way.\\xa0 Jon, the fact that I don’t want to exert my power is much different.\\xa0 We have the power.\\n\\nYou asked, “Does the federal government have the power?”\\xa0 The federal government has absolute power.\\xa0 It has the power.\\xa0 As to whether or not I’ll use that power, we’ll see.\\xa0 I would rather —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So if New York wants to stay closed down, you can —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Jon, I would rather work with the states, because I like going down to a local government.\\xa0 That’s why with — I guess it’s now seven states not eight that — because South Carolina did — you know, they went away from what we discussed the last time.\\xa0 So that’s why I looked at the individual states; they’re doing a very good job.\\xa0 They’re really doing a very good job.\\xa0 I’d rather have them make the decision.\\n\\nNow, the fact that I’d rather have — that’s fine.\\xa0 But I have the absolute right to do if I want to.\\xa0 I may not want to.\\xa0 We have a very good relationship.\\xa0 Now, we’ll see what happens.\\n\\nIf you notice, the few states you’re talking about, they’re all with Democrat governors.\\xa0 But if governors are doing a good job and they control it better — because you don’t have somebody in Washington saying, “Set up a testing site in the parking lot of a Walmart.”\\xa0 And we’re in Washington and they’re in a state that’s very far away.\\xa0 That’s really — it should be and it should have always been.\\xa0 And I’ve always said it was.\\n\\nBut the relationship we have now with the states and governors is very good.\\xa0 And we’ll be announcing, over the next very short period of time, exactly what we’re going to be doing.\\n\\nOkay, a couple of more.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On coronavirus and Joe Biden: He’s the presumptive Democratic nominee.\\xa0 Do you have any plans yet on when you’ll start sharing, or when the White House will start sharing some of that information about the coronavirus?\\xa0 Your presidential daily brief?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, nobody has called about coronavirus, about — from their standpoint.\\xa0 Look, they had the H1N1, which is swine flu, and that was a big failure.\\xa0 That was a tremendous failure.\\xa0 They had a lot of failures.\\xa0\\xa0And you take a look at what — you take a look at the history.\\xa0 And, you know, 17,000 people died.\\xa0 And you talk about late?\\xa0 They were so late — they were late like it never even existed.\\xa0 That was a — that was a big problem.\\xa0 Caused a lot of other people a big problem too.\\n\\nSo, you know, if Joe Biden would like a briefing, I’d certainly get him a briefing.\\xa0 I don’t know what he’d do with it.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, are Jared and Ivanka on — serving on the new task force?\\xa0 And how are you going to balance —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, they’re not.\\xa0 No.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Yes, go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I just want to clarify.\\xa0 So, in earlier conversation, there was a description of multiple different councils or tasks — task forces.\\xa0 Can you just explain exactly what the structure is and who is going to be on it?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, you have Mike’s task force, which is the White House Task Force, which really brought us up to this point brilliantly, I must say.\\xa0 Dealt with governors and dealt with governors all the way through.\\xa0 And I was on many of those calls.\\xa0 And every call got better and better and better.\\xa0 It was hostile at the beginning.\\xa0 By the time we finished — I mean, today’s call was a very good call, a very friendly call.\\xa0 I think everyone is online.\\n\\nAnd again, you don’t have anybody driving you crazy, saying they’re not getting ventilators, they’re not getting all of the different things, they need more beds.\\xa0 They have a lot of beds right now.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible) hospitals who — doctors who say they don’t have the supplies that they need.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And we always err — and I think it’s important for you know — we always erred on the sake of “Give them more.”\\xa0 Even when we didn’t think — we didn’t think New York needed the beds that they were asking for.\\xa0 We didn’t think they needed the ventilators that they asked for.\\xa0 And we were right.\\n\\nNow, on ventilators, we’re ready to march.\\xa0 I told you this: We’re ready to march.\\xa0 We have 10,000 ventilators.\\xa0 We’re ready to move them anywhere in the country when we need them, if we need them.\\xa0 We’re also building a lot of ventilators, and that’s going to be used at some point, I believe.\\xa0 You know we’re going to have stockpiles, including state stockpiles if they want to work out some kind of an arrangement with us.\\xa0 But we’re also going to help other countries, whether it’s Italy, or Spain, or other — France is having a big problem.\\xa0 They all desperately need — Germany too — they need ventilators.\\n\\nSo we’re going to have a lot of ventilators.\\xa0 We have a lot — you heard the numbers — we have a lot coming next week.\\xa0 Next week, we have a tremendous amount coming.\\n\\nOkay, final question.\\xa0 Steve.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And on the task force — I’d asked for the task — how the task force is going to be structured.\\xa0 Is it one —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 Then we have — in addition to that, we have a number of committees.\\xa0 We’ll have a transportation committee.\\xa0 We’re going to have a manufacturing committee.\\xa0 You’ll see it tomorrow.\\n\\nWe’re also having a religious leaders committee.\\xa0 We have a great group of religious leaders.\\xa0 We’re having committees with religious leaders.\\xa0 You’ve been seeing what’s going on with the churches, and all of that.\\xa0 And we’re going to have a faith leaders committee.\\n\\nAnd so we have — we’re going to have a few committees.\\xa0 I’ll call them “committees,” and then ultimately we’re going to make decisions.\\xa0 So we’re going to make decisions fairly quickly, and I think they’re going to be the correct decision.\\xa0 I hope so.\\n\\nSteve.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you form the economic task force tomorrow.\\xa0 When do you want them to have recommendations for you?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Soon.\\xa0 Soon.\\xa0 And they already know what I want.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Next week or —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And so, when we form — when you say “form,” I don’t have to give them instructions.\\xa0 These are very sophisticated people.\\xa0 These are the best people in their fields.\\xa0 So I don’t have to say, “Gee, let’s — we just met and we’re going to meet in two weeks and here’s what we’re…” I said, “Here’s what I want.”\\xa0 We’ve already told them.\\xa0 And they’re the —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What did you tell them you want?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — the best names in the various businesses and professions and religions.\\xa0 I mean, they’re — these are the greatest names.\\xa0 The people that, I think, probably know the best.\\n\\nSo, we’ve called them and we’re going to be speaking to them very soon.\\xa0 And we want them to have — if it’s questions, or statements, we want them to have that for us.\\xa0 And we will have either a response, or maybe — I mean, ideally we’re going to be learning from them.\\xa0 And we’ll be able to do that and put them — put everything we learned from those calls into our new guidelines.\\n\\nSo we’re going to have new guidelines coming soon.\\xa0 I think it’s going to be very good.\\xa0 I think it’s going to be very smooth.\\xa0 And I hope it’s going to be very safe.\\n\\nThank you all very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Any thoughts on Stanley Chera, sir?\\xa0 Any thoughts on Stanley Chera —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Stanley Chera is a friend of mine for a long time.\\xa0 He’s a great real estate person — passed away.\\xa0 Was a great real estate person.\\xa0 Great.\\xa0 Great.\\xa0 Sort of a legend in New York real estate.\\n\\nHe called me a couple of weeks ago, said he tested positive.\\xa0 Stanley is in his early- to mid-80s, I guess.\\xa0 And Stanley went to the hospital and he never came out.\\xa0 He went into a coma.\\xa0 He was unconscious for a long period of time and he never made it.\\xa0 A great man.\\xa0 He left — very charitable, really a great philanthropist.\\xa0 A very, very successful person in Manhattan, in the real estate business.\\xa0 So I got to know him a lot.\\n\\nHe was so excited when his friend from New York became the President of the United States.\\xa0 He was like — like a young boy.\\xa0 And he was not a young boy, but he was like a young boy.\\xa0 He was so excited.\\xa0 He thought we’d do such a good job and he was so happy.\\xa0 And he — he was very proud of what we’ve done in this administration.\\n\\nBut he was tested positive, and unfortunately he — he didn’t make it.\\xa0 It’s a very — to me, it’s a very sad thing.\\n\\nThank you all very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 As the President mentioned, the task force today spoke to 48 of the nation’s governors.\\xa0 On that call, we reflected on the fact that all — all 50 states had emergency declarations in place, which was a first for American history; $5.2 billion had been distributed to the states under the Stafford Act.\\xa0 And it was a productive call and reflective of President Trump’s ongoing direction for us to work closely with the states to make sure the states in the areas most impacted by the coronavirus have what they need, when they need it.\\n\\nWe spoke about the issue of testing and supplies.\\xa0 And I’m going to ask Dr. Deborah Birx to come forward, as well as Admiral Polowczyk, to reflect on both of those topics for you.\\xa0 Dr. Birx has been leading an effort from the task force from early on, on rapidly expanding testing.\\n\\nIt was early on that the President formed that public-private partnership with commercial labs.\\xa0 And as we stand here today, more than 2.5 million tests have been performed.\\xa0 And when we add in the estimates of labs that we have to assume, with reasonable protections — projections have not yet reported into the CDC, we think that number could be closer to 3 million tests that have been performed.\\n\\nAs has been mentioned, the new 15-minute test, we are — we are working closely with Abbott Laboratories — that the President and our team met with today here at the White House — to rapidly increase the availability of cartridges.\\xa0 Abbott is producing roughly 50,000 cartridges a day.\\xa0 FEMA acquired an initial supply of that and distributed those to the states, but we’re working with the states to not only distribute what’s being made, but also work with other suppliers to create additional cartridges.\\n\\nA point that I’ll ask Dr. Birx to expand on in just a moment is the fact that — beyond the new 15-minute test by Abbott Laboratories; beyond what we expect to be a new antibody test, which may well be approved by the FDA in just a matter of days; and an antibody test that would be produced at the rate of 20 million tests a month — the reality is that those commercial laboratories that the President brought in here, the better part of two months ago, and initiated that public- and private-partnership with have been producing hundreds of thousands of tests every single week.\\n\\nBut as Dr. Birx and our team have apprehended, we believe, at this point in time, that of the Roche equipment that is out there that does the high-speed testing — and we informed governors of this today — we think that that some 20 percent of that capacity is not being used.\\n\\nAnd with regard to the Abbott m2000 systems, we told the governors today that we think 75 percent of that laboratory capacity that exists in the United States today is not being utilized by our governors.\\xa0 So we sent a very clear message to governors today to reach out to their hospitals, reach out to their labs to identify the presence of the Roche Amplicor 500 and the Abbott m2000 to get those activated.\\n\\nWe literally estimate that, although we’re doing over 110,000 tests a day in the United States, that if our — if our governors and state labs would simply activate the machines that are already there, we could double the amount of testing in the United States literally overnight.\\xa0 And so, I know that governors’ teams watch these briefings, and we’ll remind them very respectfully again to identify those labs.\\xa0 And we have a — we have a team that now is deploying, reaching out to labs to see if we can activate all of those labs.\\n\\nSecondly, on the subject of supplies — I’ve said it a couple of times from this podium today, but let me say it one more time: President Trump’s direction to us, in dealing with the states on personal protective equipment and ventilators, has been to make sure that states have what they need, when they need it.\\xa0 And we recognize that while we all watch the overall curve of the coronavirus in America — understandably, the national numbers — the reality is this outbreak has taken place in its own individual curves: first, on the West Coast; then the New York City area; then Louisiana, Michigan; and now we continue to contend with it in Chicago and Houston and other metropolitan areas.\\xa0 It has given us the opportunity to ensure that personal protective equipment and ventilators are made available on a critical basis.\\n\\nAnd I have to tell you: We’re incredibly proud of the effort and the partnership with states that has us standing here today that no one who has required a ventilator has been denied a ventilator in the United States of America.\\n\\nAt this point, we have just short of 7,000 ventilators in the Strategic National Stockpile.\\xa0 But as — as Admiral Polowczyk will detail, we’re already beginning to receive newly manufactured ventilators.\\xa0 We’ll get another thousand in this week.\\xa0 By the middle of May, we’ll literally have another 8,000 ventilators available for deployment around the country.\\n\\nI’m going to let him describe to you the specific detailing of those resources.\\xa0 But — but I want to — I want to share these numbers, most especially for our healthcare workers around the country in the areas most impacted by the coronavirus, so that you know the resources are surging into the hospital systems at the point of the need, and we will continue to do just that.\\n\\nSo let me recognize Dr. Birx to reflect on the data and also on, maybe, some comments on testing.\\xa0 And then Admiral Polowczyk, if you can step up and then you’ll describe the supplies.\\xa0 We’ll hear from Dr. Fauci again, and then take a few questions.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Great.\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 I don’t know if we can get the first slide on cumulative cases?\\xa0 Yes, thank you so much.\\n\\nI wanted to show you a different way of looking at it today.\\xa0 Obviously, we look at case counts per 100,000 Americans in each of our states and metro areas, but I wanted you to see, in absolute numbers, how much the New York, New Jersey metro area dwarfs all other metro areas.\\n\\nAnd so you can’t even see Chicago, Detroit, or Boston.\\xa0 All of those metro areas are under 25,000 cases.\\xa0 You can see that the New York, New Jersey metro area is about almost 250,000 when you bring those cases together — almost a log more.\\xa0 And that’s why you hear us talking a lot about the metro area of New York and New Jersey; and the counties of Rockland and Westchester and Suffolk and Nassau and Bergen, New Jersey; and why we’re so focused on getting resources to that metro area.\\n\\nIf I could see the next slide, then.\\xa0 So if I take New York and New Jersey metro area out, this is the other metro areas that we have been tracking very closely.\\xa0 I wanted to show this to you so that you could see how those curves are already starting to plateau.\\n\\nSo, if you look at Detroit, if you look at Philadelphia, if you look at Louisiana — Louisiana is in green.\\xa0 Detroit is in gray.\\xa0 You can see across the board, across these metro areas — across metro areas with — have a higher concentration of individuals, this is what the American people in these large cities have done, where it is more difficult often to socially distance.\\xa0 And we’re just really impressed by the work of the mayors and the governors to make this happen.\\n\\nI also wanted you to see this because you can clearly see Chicago and Boston.\\xa0 And so, Chicago is in the orange and Boston is in the yellow.\\xa0 They are crossing Detroit.\\xa0 And that’s why we have been very much focused on the needs of those areas.\\xa0 And there is one — and Providence is also in that category.\\xa0 It’s difficult for them to — for you to see you them because they’re much further down on the slide.\\n\\nBut the highest — if you look at the axis on this slide — it’s 25,000.\\xa0 The axis on the last slide was 300,000.\\xa0 And so that’s why I really want people to understand each of these epidemics, minor — these small epidemics in each of the metro areas — we’re tracking independently, as well as any epidemics and outbreaks that are happening in some of our other states.\\n\\nSo I just wanted you to have that perspective of how significant the New York, New Jersey issue is and why we’ve been tracking that so closely.\\xa0 But I also wanted to assure all of the other states that we’re tracking them also very closely and really working with the governors and mayors and across — and that’s why I wanted you to see that not only are the curves flattening in some of those major metropolitan areas, but they’re starting to decrease.\\xa0 And this is what we’re very excited about.\\xa0 These are cases.\\xa0 We also know that mortality will lag.\\xa0 And so we’re really tracking also the number of individuals who have succumbed to the COVID-19.\\n\\nI also wanted to really note here that, yes, our mortality is less when you combine European countries equal to the size of the United States.\\xa0 And I think this is really two things: One, it’s the incredible work of the American people, that it’s also the incredible work of our healthcare providers, and the system of each of these hospitals that have the resources and the ability to respond to the needs of the COVID-19 patients.\\xa0 And I think you can really see the superb healthcare delivery that is happening by the low mortality.\\n\\nJust to mention really quickly about testing — because you’ve heard me before talk about it, and then it was a little bit misquoted and misaligned — but there are multiple Abbott machines, so I’m going to be very clear, having spent years in the laboratory.\\xa0 The high-throughput machines, which are the Roche 6800 and the 88- — I think it’s the 8800 on Roche — and the Abbott M2000 — these are the machines that run between 500 and 1,000 assays at a time.\\n\\nThe Abbott company worked really hard, three weeks ago, in getting a million tests out there to be utilized.\\xa0 And they can make a million tests a week for all of our laboratories that have these platforms.\\xa0 And, so far, to date, somewhere around 250,000 tests have been utilized in three weeks’ worth of work.\\xa0 And that’s why we’ve really been appealing to the — to the laboratory directors to really bring all those machines on.\\n\\nLast week, Dr. Fauci and his incredible team of researchers have agreed to really reach out and find additional Roche and Abbott high-throughput machines that are in research institutions and doing critical research work, to bring them online also to supplement the other laboratories’ work, to create a mosaic and a complete strategy that brings together the high-throughput platforms, with the medium-throughput platforms, with what are the low-throughput but rapid platforms — which is this ID NOW.\\n\\nID NOW is not going to be the answer to the number of tests that we need over the next few weeks.\\xa0 Those run a test every 15 minutes, and we can get about 55,000 cartridges a day.\\n\\nBut I just got done saying that these other machines — of which we have hundreds of — can run 500 to 1,000 in a single timeframe.\\xa0 And so we need to bring all of these assays together. \\xa0And a team has been created to call every single laboratory and every single research institution across the United States to define the complete capacity in every single state.\\xa0 Because it shouldn’t be our expectation that every governor understands exactly everything that’s in his state, but we have to understand everything in every state in order to be able to meet the needs of the American people as we increase testing.\\n\\nNow, I know you all know that, in three weeks, we went from 300,000 tests total to 3 million tests total, in three weeks.\\xa0 We know that we have to further increase that.\\xa0 That has been done really by HHS and Admiral Giroir and the team up there.\\xa0 And we’re going to supplement that team to really bring on all of the additional resources and platforms that we have in the United States of America, just like we did with ventilators to bring all of the capacity to bear so that we can also continue to increase testing.\\n\\nAlso, of course as these epidemics are si- — decrease, you can also be able to use more and more testing for surveillance.\\xa0 But I do want to call out the 19 states that aren’t ever represented in these graphics in — by and large.\\xa0 The states have been continuing to do containment and outbreak investigation.\\n\\nAnd I’ve been able to talk to many of those states.\\xa0 And I just remind all of us, when I talked to each one of these state health officials, where they are finding outbreaks are in nursing homes.\\xa0 And so we really knew to —\\xa0need to continue to protect and we continue to test in nursing homes, because we know that that’s a particularly vulnerable group and it’s a group we’re often — now that we’re beginning to understand asymptomatic transmission.\\n\\nNo one is intending to pass the virus on to others, but we know, in essential workers around the United States, people are unknowingly infected and then passing the virus on.\\xa0 And so those are the ones that were very interested in finding.\\xa0 And you might say, “Well, how do you find them because they don’t have symptoms?”\\xa0 And so this is where we really have to increase surveillance in a very deliberative and understand way.\\n\\nAnd so we’re really looking what are sentinel surveillance sites.\\xa0 I think we can see where there’s outbreaks, because once people have symptoms, you can see them.\\xa0 But where do you do sentinel surveillance so that you find them before they have symptoms.\\xa0 This is what we have done for decades in HIV, and it’s what’s allowing us right now to really control the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa, because we’re finding people when they’re asymptomatic and treating them when they’re asymptomatic.\\xa0 So this is something we know how to do and it’s something we’re working very closely with CDC and others on to make sure that we can bring that full capacity to the American people.\\n\\nSo these are just some insights and what we’re working on.\\xa0 We’re continuing, obviously, to track every single county and community.\\n\\nAnd then, finally, I’m going to call on one additional group.\\xa0 There’s a group out there of our HIV/AIDS activists and community workers that understand these tests that I’ve been talking about, these DNA — these RNA-based tests.\\xa0 Because they often get viral loads in HIV.\\xa0 But they will know how to explain this to the community, about sampling and what it means to run those assays.\\xa0 They are essentially virologists.\\xa0 They understand all of these assays.\\xa0 They also understand the antibody assays, because it’s the antibody assays that they counsel and utilize in HIV testing across the United States.\\n\\nAnd maybe it will be our translator to the American public and to their local mayors.\\xa0 They understand these tests.\\xa0 They’re — essentially understand all the virology and all the immunology.\\xa0 And I’m really asking all of them to help us communicate what these tests are so the community is ready for them.\\xa0 Because antibody tests measure something very different than the viral load in the front of your nose that we’re using for diagnosis.\\xa0 And so, really being able to understand all of those tests, when to use them, how to use them will be really critical.\\xa0 But the great thing is, in the United States of America, we have these community groups that understand these tests very well, and we’ll be able to discuss them at every level with their community.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m going to call Admiral Polowczyk up in a minute, but I have to call on Dr. Tony Fauci.\\n\\nLet me — let me — let me just say something really straight from my heart, if I can.\\xa0 I lost my dad 32 years ago today.\\xa0 April 13th is always a tough day for our family.\\xa0 And this morning, when my brothers and sisters were sending around pictures of dad, like we always do, I just thought of the families of the more than 22,000 Americans that we’ve lost.\\n\\nAnd I just want to tell you that you’re on our hearts, and you’re in the prayers of millions of Americans as you — as you deal with this heartbreaking loss, as well as families that have family members that are struggling with serious illness.\\n\\nBut let me just encourage everyone that, in the midst of that loss, because the American people have been putting these mitigation measures into practice, there are families that are still together today.\\xa0 And I just want to encourage you here at roughly the halfway point of “30 Days to Slow the Spread,” to take — take that to heart.\\xa0 In no way minimize the losses that we’ve experienced as a nation and as families, but — but to be encouraged to know, when you see those numbers on the vast majority of states, that because of what the American people are doing, it’s working.\\n\\nAnd Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx, and the entire team, continually asked us to remind the American people, and we do so again today: Keep doing what you’re doing with the “30 Days to Slow the Spread,” and we will hasten the day that we heal our land.\\n\\nDr. Fauci?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 I just want to make one comment that related to a question that was asked, and then we’ll have questions.\\xa0 I don’t want to take too much time.\\xa0 The idea about how we would evaluate, from a purely public health standpoint, about what I call reentry into some sort of normality.\\xa0 As health people, I don’t know anything about, nor do I ever claim to know anything about, economics.\\xa0 There are going to be people that know a lot more than I do, who are going to give advice about all of the committees that the President was talking about.\\n\\nBut the one thing we do know as health people, as physicians and scientists and public health people — as I mentioned, I think over the weekend, on one of the shows, is that some people may think it’s going to be like a light switch, on and off.\\xa0 You know, we’re either out and we’re in.\\xa0 It’s just not going to be that way because we have a very large country and there are different impacts.\\xa0 As you see, New York is very different from other parts of the country, from the Midwest, from the mountain region, California and Washington, different than New Orleans.\\n\\nSo as we discuss and consider the public health aspects, it likely would be something that I refer to as sort of like a rolling reentry.\\xa0 It’s not going to be one size fits all.\\xa0 So I don’t know what it’s going to be yet because we still have time to look at it.\\n\\nDr. Birx, who does an amazing job with showing you the data and the charts — that’s going to likely influence some of the recommendations that we will make.\\xa0 But I can assure you there will be recommendations that will be based purely on public health.\\xa0 And the President will get a lot of other input from others, but we’ll give the honest, public health recommendation.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Tony.\\xa0 Admiral?\\xa0 Admiral Polowczyk will give an update on supplies and then we’ll take a few questions.\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 Can I have the ventilator slide back up?\\xa0 I’ll just start from there.\\xa0 All right, thank you.\\n\\nSo you start with what’s in the stockpile this morning.\\xa0 And then here’s the contracts that we’ll be delivering over the next few weeks.\\xa0 And we added 8,600 ventilators to the pool we already had.\\xa0 That’s the — that’s the math that you — that you get there.\\xa0 That’s a — that’s included the DPA action with GM.\\n\\nAnd we’ll say that we’ve also issued what would be called “rated orders” with all of these vendors to allow them front-of-the-line privileges, so to speak, with — within their supply chain.\\xa0 So these — there’s — we’ve, you know, written the contract.\\xa0 This is the 100,000-plus ventilators we’re talking about, and then continue to work with them to ensure that the ventilators actually show up.\\xa0 So there’s a continue to work there.\\xa0 And as we did that, we realized that downstream supply chains needed some additional Defense Production Act work as well.\\n\\nIf you go out to the air bridge — 80 flights scheduled, 37 complete, 43 on the — on the horizon.\\xa0 And you can see the numbers of material that’s been brought in to supplement the volume that’s needed.\\n\\nNow, I’m going to go through a series of slides of New York first.\\xa0 So, Dr. Birx provides me what I will call as a geographic reference to align the supply chain.\\xa0 So all of those cities — you’ll see a little bit of a theme here.\\xa0 I’ll be talking about a lot of the — a lot of the cities and geographic areas.\\n\\nI aligned the supply chain to those geographic areas to try to get as much there, while we realize the rest of the nation needs supplies as well.\\xa0 And then we aligned to the supply chain to site of care: public hospitals, VA, private hospitals, nursing homes, first responders, acute care, and on down the line.\\n\\nSo the last business week — so, Monday of last week through Friday, Saturday of the past week — these are the mass materials that came into the New York, New Jersey metro area, and you can see the volumes there.\\n\\nSo if you go to Detroit, we talked about their hotspot.\\xa0 Here’s the volumes of deliveries going into Detroit for that same time period.\\n\\nIf you can go to Chicago.\\xa0 And I’m going to run through this kind of quick, but you can see that the geographic alignment, the places that Dr. Birx has talked about is where we’re concentrating supplies.\\n\\nYou can go to New Orleans, to give you an understanding.\\xa0 Washington D.C., right?\\xa0 So now I can talk about that.\\xa0 Today was a — you know, a very, kind of, early entry into the Washington, D.C., Baltimore — right? — positioning supplies ahead of need, we hope, in Washington.\\n\\nGo to Baltimore, and you can see trying to — the volumes there, trying to get ahead of that.\\xa0 And then Philadelphia is next.\\n\\nAnd then now the next slide is a nine-city roll-up.\\xa0 And so to save a little time, I did not include Boston and Houston in there.\\xa0 So you can see the volume of material flowing through a commercial network air bridge, their supplies, into geographic regions and then — and then further prioritize to site of care.\\n\\nNow, final topic: N95 masks.\\xa0 So the Department of Defense announced a DPA action this weekend.\\xa0 That came over from DOD on Friday, into the White House, approved on Saturday.\\xa0 And contract awarded today $131 million, five companies: 3M, Honeywell, Owens & Minor, Moldex, and Draeger.\\n\\nYou know, the CARES Act was signed before the — before March was end — towards the end there.\\xa0 So essentially two weeks from that money being put into the Title III authority for DOD.\\xa0 This action takes us from a baseline of what — what was being produced domestically of about 30 million masks upwards to, as we go through the fall into the end of the winter, 120 million masks domestically.\\n\\nSo, currently, we’re filling some of that demand from overseas sources.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 And so the additive masks here, through this, will ramp up, lower dependence on overseas sources, and that — that will essentially secure a big piece of the supply chain.\\n\\nFive companies, six — six cities: Smithfield, Rhode Island; Phoenix, Arizona; Del Rio, Texas; Lexington, North Carolina; Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin; and Aberdeen, North Dakota — all either producing more fabric or increasing production facilities to have that ramp up.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Great.\\xa0 Great job.\\xa0 Thank you, Admiral.\\n\\nAnd can we put that slide — I guess it’s still up.\\xa0 This is for just the week ending April 11.\\xa0 We have distributed or directed the distribution of 5.3 million N95 masks, 5.5 million surgical masks, 110 million gloves.\\xa0 We shared that mostly just to make sure our healthcare workers know that the resources are flowing, we’re going to continue to flow them, but this is just the numbers for this week and don’t include, for instance, what the President announced.\\n\\nI was able to tell Governor Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania today that, next week, they’ll be receiving 2 million N95 masks to support some of the healthcare challenges that they’re facing in the broader Philadelphia area.\\n\\nSo, with that, we’ll be happy to take a couple of questions.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you so much.\\xa0 One for the Admiral and then one for Dr. Fauci, if you don’t mind.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Admiral, wouldn’t it have been useful, as you’re going through, you know, all of those supplies that are now making their way into the system — you talked about having to buy foreign products, you know, as we’re catching up and making it — wouldn’t it have been useful if it hadn’t taken until mid-March for the government to start placing bulk orders for these kinds of supplies?\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 Okay so, I came over from the Pentagon the 20th of March, so I’ll speak from the 20th March on now.\\xa0 We’re using the Defense Production Act.\\xa0 I think you’ll see much more use of that as we go forward.\\xa0 You know, we make —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, but my question is about the timing here and that lost time that the President earlier today denied.\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 I know.\\xa0 And I’m not — I’m not equipped to talk about — other than from about the 20th of March forward.\\xa0 I just — I wasn’t — I was over at the Joint Staff.\\xa0 I wasn’t involved.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And I wanted to ask Dr. Fauci —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Dr. Fauci.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — you know, you said that you’d be, you know, giving the President your recommendations, you and Dr. Birx, coming up with a plan that you guys are comfortable with.\\xa0 Are you willing, once the President has made his decision, are you willing to come here and tell us, tell the American public, what you actually had recommended to him and whether he followed through with what you recommended?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 I’m not really — what do you mean?\\xa0 Like —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So when the President stands up here, whether it’s, you know, May 1st — whatever day it is — and outlines his plan, are you willing to stand up here after him and tell us all, tell the American public, what it was that you had recommended he do if there is a difference?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 You know, I have to think about that because, you know, when you have conversations with the President, sometimes they really should be confidential in what you give him because he’s going to have to make his own choice.\\n\\nI’d have to think about that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So that way we would know whether he was actually listening to the health advice that he’s being provided.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 He is.\\xa0 I mean, he — I can tell you one thing: He’ll listen.\\xa0 But I think what’s going to happen — you know, I don’t know for sure — is that he will get input from a number of individuals representing a number of aspects of society; one of them will be health.\\xa0 The only thing that I can tell you is that I will give him the advice based on evidence, my observation of what the best public health approach would be.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Fauci?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just to go back to where we started today, which was with the President’s seeming frustrations with some of the reporting about his early decision-making process in January and February.\\n\\nAs I’m sure you know, the reason we, in the press, do that kind of reporting is so that the next President that comes along, has to deal with a pandemic, can learn some of these lessons.\\n\\nWhat — having watched this unfold up close, what do you think were the mistakes that were made early on that a future President could learn from?\\xa0 With the benefit of hindsight, of course.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 You know, I —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Because no President gets everything right, obviously.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 I understand.\\xa0 I don’t want to use the word “mistakes,” because when you’re in the — in the fog of war when you’re doing something, you have to make decisions.\\xa0 You get input from a number of individuals.\\xa0 It’s always a moving target.\\xa0 And I just don’t want to be — have anything taken out of context because I already had one of those already in the last couple of days — (laughs) — so I don’t want to go through it again.\\n\\nI wouldn’t say “mistake.”\\xa0 Could things have done better?\\xa0 Of course.\\xa0 I mean, nothing is perfect.\\xa0 And you could always do better.\\xa0 But, I mean, I hesitate to say something is a “mistake.”\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But with the benefit of hindsight, with that caveat, what could have been done better?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Well, I mean, I can’t — I can’t comment about anything outside of my own field.\\xa0 But the thing that, when I think back on, was evolving, in my mind, was something that was a virus that was much worse than what I had thought it was going to be, based on what we had learned early on, when it was first felt to be something that just jumped from an animal to a human, and really didn’t have much capability of going human to human.\\xa0 And then, all of a sudden, you find out that not only was it not just animal to human, but there were a lot of — that’s probably the way it started.\\n\\nBut then, as you go back and you realize there were probably a lot of infections, that maybe if we had dealt into that a little bit more, we could have learned that not only is it affecting human to human, but it’s transmitting really efficiently.\\n\\nWhen I question myself — I’m not perfect; maybe I — I wouldn’t say made “mistakes,” but maybe I should have really tried to delve into that a little bit more about what was going on, but the information wasn’t as forthcoming as I would have liked.\\n\\nAnd then, all of a sudden, when you find out that you’re dealing with something that is not only what had been your worst nightmare — because people ask me that: “What is your worst nightmare?” — a brand-new virus that’s respiratory transmitted, that has a high degree of transmissibility, that has a high degree of morbidity and mortality.\\xa0 You know, is that a mistake?\\xa0 Maybe I should have been able to realize that earlier.\\xa0 I’m not sure it was a mistake; it was just an evolving thing that we finally realized and said, “Whoa, this is really worse than we could have imagined.”\\n\\nAIDE:\\xa0 All right.\\xa0 Last one, guys.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 When you met with Abbott Laboratories today, what did you ask them to do?\\xa0 What did they say they could do?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we spoke with Abbott Laboratories today about how we can increase significantly the production of cartridges for the 15-minute test.\\xa0 Because, remember, we’re — we are — we’re not only scaling to rapidly expand testing across the country today.\\xa0 And it’s one of the reasons why you heard me and Dr. Birx say that we are — we have an entire team now that’s going to be working with governors and with laboratories around the country to identify the machines that already exist today and that could be activated in doing tests.\\n\\nBut we also — we also want to work with Abbott Laboratories for the longer term.\\xa0 Because if the current trend lines hold — and I hope and I literally pray that we will soon find ourselves on the downslope of the coronavirus in this country — this epidemic, in its current form, will come to an end.\\n\\nBut as we make decisions in the days ahead to reopen America, what President Trump also wants to do is have a policy in place to stay open.\\xa0 And having the kind of surveillance testing available around the country so that CDC can do the immediate contact tracing, when you have a positive test, so that we can deploy resources like the new Abbott 15-minute test specifically to nursing homes.\\n\\nWe spoke today to Governor Baker in Massachusetts, to Governor Hogan in Maryland, both of whom who have been very innovative implementing federal guidelines for preventing the spread of infectious disease at nursing homes, and we commend them for that.\\xa0 But being able to increase the manufacture of those devices so they can be deployed going forward in the months ahead is also a focal point of our efforts.\\n\\nSo, rapidly continuing to expand testing today.\\xa0 And the governor of Louisiana told me today that they had tested at the highest per capita — according to his numbers — of any state in the union.\\xa0 And we congratulate him for that.\\xa0 But making sure that, going forward, we’ll have the infrastructure of testing all across America to deal with the coronavirus should it return in the future.\\n\\nWith that, let me — let me bid you all a good evening.\\xa0 And we will be back tomorrow.\\xa0 And —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Vice President —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I just have a question about these cartridges and this timeline because the New Hampshire governor says the federal government is in charge of distributing those — FEMA is.\\xa0 So what is the timeline for when they’ll have enough of them?\\xa0 Because they say they don’t have enough.\\xa0 Illinois said they didn’t have enough.\\xa0 So what’s the timeline that you’re working with?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, let me — let me let Dr. Birx address that.\\xa0 But there’s a — there was an initial tranche that we purchased.\\xa0 There’s some 18,000 Abbott Laboratory machines around the country, and FEMA acquired a certain amount that were immediately distributed across the states.\\n\\nBut now Abbott Laboratories is literally producing some 50,000 a day, and those are available in the open market.\\xa0 And we’re also going to be working with Abbott and with the states to deploy those resources.\\n\\nAnd we’re also working with other manufacturers to increase the production of cartridges.\\xa0 But if there’s more to that that you want to add, Deb, we’ll make it the last.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 No, that was perfectly said.\\xa0 I just want to — sometimes you ask those questions, and I always want to make sure that people understand.\\n\\nSo, a third of them went specifically to Indian Health Service and to these states that have smaller epidemics.\\xa0 Two thirds of it went into the public market, mostly targeted to the places where there is high disease.\\xa0 But only two thirds went that way so that people could purchase them directly, and one third went to the Indian Health Service and to the smaller states that really need these.\\n\\nAnd so I think what we’re trying to do now is balance the entire testing framework of medium-, low-, and high-throughput machines to give everyone the maximum flexibility, state by state, based on what the needs are at that moment.\\n\\nIf there’s an outbreak and you have to do 5,000 tests, you’re not going to do them on an ID NOW machine that takes 15 minutes for every negative, but you’re going to do it on your high-throughput machine.\\xa0 So making sure everybody knows where everything is and what is being run will be really critical moving forward, because we can’t leave anything not on –everything has to be on the table in order for us to be able to dramatically increase testing yet another — we went up by a log in three weeks.\\xa0 So if we’re going to increase again, it’s going to have to be getting every piece of equipment on\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Let just again say thank you all for your time and attention.\\xa0 And thanks to every American who’s joined us tonight.\\n\\nI just want to encourage you we’re going to continue to lean into this effort, to expand testing across the country, to deploy supplies to our incredible healthcare workers that have done such an amazing job in the midst of the coronavirus epidemic.\\n\\nBut my last word, on behalf of the President, on behalf of our entire task force is: It’s “30 Days to Slow the Spread.”\\xa0 And I know we’re almost at the halfway point, and I know it’s been a month of these mitigation strategies, but I hope as you look on, as you see the progress that’s made on the West Coast, the beginnings of real progress in the Greater New York City area, Louisiana, Detroit, and elsewhere — I hope it will only steel your resolve to continue to do your part to slow the spread, because we’ll get through this, but it’ll take all of us to continue to do it.\\n\\nSo thank you to the American people for all your efforts, and we’ll see you tomorrow.\\n\\nEND\\n\\n8:12 P.M.

       "  'text': 'James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\\n\\n1:52 P.M. EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much everybody, and good afternoon.\\xa0 Today is Good Friday.\\xa0 And this Sunday, millions of Christians celebrate Easter and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\\xa0 At this holy time, we pray that God will heal the sick and comfort the heartbroken and bless our heroes.\\xa0 As American families look forward to Easter, we’re reminded that our story ends not in despair, but in triumph and renewal.\\xa0 Very appropriate, isn’t it?\\n\\nI’d like to provide Americans an update on our ongoing efforts in the war against the invisible enemy.\\xa0 Before I do that, I’ll have a couple of notes.\\xa0 The United States, in discussions last night with Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and –dealing with OPEC nations — we are trying to get Mexico, as the expression goes, “over the barrel.”\\xa0 And Mexico is committing to do 100,000 fewer barrels.\\n\\nThe President and I spoke last night.\\xa0 We have a great relationship, great friendship.\\xa0 They’re helping us very much at the border.\\xa0 They have 27,000 soldiers — Mexican soldiers — on our border right now, stopping people from coming into our country as our wall goes up.\\xa0 We’re up to about 168 miles of wall.\\n\\nAnd in speaking with the President, they have a limit.\\xa0 The OPEC nations have agreed to a different limit: a reduction of about 23 percent.\\xa0 So what I thought I would do — and I don’t know that it’s going to be accepted; we’ll find out — the United States will help Mexico along and they’ll reimburse us sometime at a later date when they’re prepared to do so.\\n\\nAnd we had a great conversation, but we’ll find out how that all works out.\\xa0 As you know, they’re trying to get rid of the glut of oil.\\xa0 There’s a tremendous glut of oil.\\xa0 And we don’t want anything to hurt our incredible industry.\\xa0 We’re actually the largest producer in the world now, so we don’t want anything to hurt those jobs — those great jobs in Texas and North Dakota, in Oklahoma, and everywhere.\\xa0 We have a tremendous energy — New Mexico — tremendous energy business.\\xa0 And we want to keep those jobs.\\n\\nSo we’re — we’re working on it.\\xa0 I think, eventually, it’s going to work out.\\xa0 It may work out quicker than what most people thought possible.\\xa0 And maybe it won’t, but it’ll work out eventually.\\n\\nOur experts are monitoring the data from every part of our country having to do with the topic that we’re here to discuss.\\xa0 In the midst of grief and pain, we’re seeing clear signs that our aggressive strategy is saving countless lives.\\xa0 Tremendous progress is being made.\\xa0 Although when you look at some of the numbers — I just spoke with Governor Cuomo; we had a good talk.\\xa0 When you look at those numbers — the numbers of death, people that have died — it’s so horrible.\\n\\nNow, on the other side, you have the numbers of beds being used, we were just saying, are substantially reduced.\\xa0 That’s usually the sign that it’s heading in the downward curve.\\xa0 So, New York, we know where that is.\\xa0 But in the midst of all this grief and this pain, we’re seeing these signs and we’re seeing them very strongly.\\xa0 And a lot of that has to do with the aggressive strategy in saving so many lives.\\xa0 We’re saving so many lives compared to what it could have been.\\n\\nSo, nobody knows what the number is, but we had a number of 100,000 lives.\\xa0 As many as that is, it’s impossible to even think of it.\\xa0 And that was the low end with a tremendous amount of work and a tremendous amount of — you can call it many different things.\\xa0 Our people had to be extremely strong and brave to be able to put up with what they’ve put up with.\\xa0 But the minimum, if you did this social distancing at every other aspect — and I think I can say 90 percent, maybe even more than that, were able to do it — the minimum number was 100,000 lives, and I think we’ll be substantially under that number.\\n\\nHard to believe that if you had 60,000 — you could never be happy, but that’s a lot fewer than we were originally told and thinking.\\xa0 So they said between 100- and 220,000 lives on the minimum side, and then up to 2.2 million lives if we didn’t do anything.\\xa0 But it showed a just tremendous resolve by the people of this country.\\n\\nSo we’ll see what it ends up being, but it looks like we’re headed to a number substantially below the 100,000.\\xa0 That would be the low mark.\\xa0 And I hope that bears out.\\n\\nThe situation in Detroit and New Orleans appears to be stabilizing.\\xa0 Detroit has really started to go up, and now it is stabilizing.\\xa0 And New Orleans is a great place; I have so many friends there.\\xa0 They can’t believe what’s happening, but it’s really stabilized.\\xa0 I spoke with the governor of Louisiana.\\xa0 And, as you know, we’re building them additional beds right now — the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA — and that is going to be done.\\xa0 And I hope they’re not going to be very well used because I think they’ve really — I don’t think they’re going to need them or certainly not very many of them.\\xa0 We built them a big hospital of 1,000 beds and now we’re — we’re in the midst of doing another 1,000.\\xa0 I don’t think they’re going to be using very many of them, and that’s a good thing.\\n\\nThere was a time, two weeks ago, where we said, “That’s not going to be nearly enough.\\xa0 We’re going to have to build more.”\\xa0 But we wanted to wait to see and I’m glad we waited.\\xa0 It just looks like they’re doing really well.\\xa0 Louisiana and the state of Michigan is doing, really, much better than we thought.\\n\\nIn Washington State, we’ve made enough progress that the governor is now able to return an Army field hospital, so we’re going to take that hospital.\\xa0 We don’t think we need any more hospitals.\\xa0 We built thousands of beds all over the country, and we think we’re probably not going to need that hospital anyway.\\xa0 And if we do, we’re ready to move it to a different location.\\n\\nIn New York, we’re seeing hospital admissions declining very substantially, as I said.\\xa0 And nationwide, the number of new cases per day is flattening substantially, suggesting that we are near the peak and our comprehensive strategy is working.\\n\\nOver time, our guidelines to slow the spread are decreasing the rate of new cases very substantially and will result in fewer hospital admissions.\\xa0 And we’re seeing that; it’s incredible.\\xa0 I think, with no exceptions, it’s looking like it’s lower.\\xa0 And again, that’s because of the people doing what they had to do.\\xa0 Great people.\\xa0 And working with elected representatives and — and the doctors, the nurses, and everybody — I mean, just everybody.\\xa0 Everybody is so, so — has been so amazing.\\n\\nI was told this morning again, “Please mention all of those people working in the grocery stores.”\\xa0 And it’s true.\\xa0 The checkouts and the clerks and the people that are really — and a number of those people have become infected.\\xa0 So we want to thank them and a shout-out to them.\\n\\nWith the tireless devotion of American doctors and nurses and all of the medical people, we’ve kept our fatality rate very, very low compared to other countries.\\xa0 My administration is closely monitoring the data on the virus’s impact on our cherished African American communities because they’ve been hit hard.\\xa0 And the Surgeon General will be sharing more of that information right after we’re finished here.\\xa0 He’ll be coming up and saying exactly what’s happening because it’s really — it’s very troublesome, I will tell you that.\\n\\nI’d also like to provide clarity on the important point for many Americans on elective surgeries.\\xa0 While we’ve asked hospitals to cancel surgeries and procedures that do not take place at this time, just not to do them now — the choice to delay any treatment still remains between the patient and their doctor.\\xa0 We’re not advising Americans to postpone medical treatment that the doctor believes should occur now.\\xa0 So it’s different kinds of surgery, obviously, but we’re really getting to the point where you can start to think about doing that surgery, if necessary, pretty soon, I think.\\xa0 Pretty soon.\\n\\nYesterday, I directed Secretary of Agriculture Sonny to — Sonny Perdue to expedite aid to American farmers.\\xa0 And Secretary Perdue will be using all of the tools at his disposal to develop a program — and very quickly — of at least $16 billion to provide relief for farmers, ranchers, and producers impacted by the coronavirus.\\n\\nIn this time of crisis, we must keep our supply chains moving from the beginning — right from beginning to end.\\xa0 And we’re committed to supporting the amazing men and women who produce supply.\\xa0 I did, last night, a statement on social media, and I said I have directed Secretary Sonny Perdue to expedite help to our farmers, especially to the smaller farmers who are very, very badly hurting right now.\\xa0 I expect Secretary Perdue to use all of the funds and authorities at his disposal to make sure that our food supply is stable and safe, and our great farmers are prosperous and continue to be prosperous.\\n\\nWe’re working very hard to make sure our food supply chain is sound and plentiful, but we all know that that begins with our farmers, cattlemen, ranchers, and producers.\\xa0 So we’re going to be working with the small farmers, the big farmers, the cattlemen, the ranchers — all of the producers.\\xa0\\xa0 We’re going to take care of them.\\xa0 We’re working with them right now.\\xa0 We have a lot of money that was put there through our use of tariffs and other means, and we’re going to help out our farmers.\\n\\nAnd I don’t think — I tell you, I’ve been helping our farmers for a couple of years because they were targeted, as you know, by China and others.\\xa0 And I think they’re very grateful to what — for what we’ve done.\\n\\nOn the medical front, the FDA — FDA has issued 47 emergency use authorizations for advancements and testing new ventilator designs, innovations, and personal protective equipment, and experimental medicines.\\xa0 And Dr. Hahn is going to be talking about that.\\xa0 We’ve cut through the red tape to give doctors and patients unprecedented freedom to make their own healthcare decisions, granting access to potential therapies and drugs.\\n\\nSince Monday, we’ve deployed two major shipments of hydroxychloroquine from our National Stockpile.\\xa0 And it’s going to various cities.\\n\\nAnd we are also disposing and getting, as quickly as we can, portions of it to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense.\\xa0 And speaking of the Department of Defense, they’re going to be sending us 10 million N95 masks that they had.\\xa0 And we’re in great shape in every way.\\xa0 We’re in great shape with ventilators.\\xa0 We’re in great shape with protective clothing.\\xa0 We have additional planeloads coming in.\\n\\nBut we’re not getting any calls from governors at this moment.\\xa0 I can speak, I think for — Vice President Pence will be talking in a little while.\\xa0 We’re getting — we’re getting very few calls from governors or anybody else needing anything.\\xa0 They’re in great shape for this surge that’s coming in certain areas in particular, and that’s a good job.\\xa0 You’ve done a great job on that, Mike.\\xa0 Really, a great job.\\xa0 I appreciate it.\\xa0 The whole country appreciates it.\\n\\nMore than 2 million coronavirus tests have now been completed, and we’re conducting approximately 100,000 more every day.\\xa0 We’re also working to bring blood-based serology tests to the market as quickly as possible so that Americans can determine whether or not they have already had the virus and potentially have immunity.\\n\\nThey have immunity if they’ve had the virus.\\xa0 A lot of them don’t even know if they’ve had it.\\xa0 Sometimes it’s brutal.\\xa0 You see the Prime Minister seems to be doing well now, I hope.\\xa0 He had a rough go of it, and still is, but he’s doing better.\\xa0 And then some people don’t even know they had it.\\xa0 It could be sniffles.\\xa0 It could be they don’t feel perfect, but they’ve had it.\\xa0 And they’re the lucky ones.\\n\\nThe NIH, CDC, and FDA are currently validating these antibody tests to ensure that they are accurate, and they’re doing that at breakneck speed. \\xa0I think we can say that, Doctor.\\xa0 And we’re going to get them approved very quickly — Dr. Hahn.\\n\\nWhen validated, we’re confident that the production will scale up to tens of millions of tests very quickly.\\xa0 We’re leading the world now in testing, by far, and we’re going to keep it that way.\\xa0 Other countries are coming to us, and they’re wanting to know about our tests and can they buy the tests, and can they do whatever they have to do to get the tests.\\xa0 And we’re going to make that — very soon, we’ll be in a position to make that possible because it’s important for them to have it.\\n\\nAnd we’re going to have an announcement on the World Health Organization sometime next week.\\xa0 As you know, we give them approximately $500 million a year, and we’re going to be talking about that subject next week.\\xa0 We’ll have a lot to say about it.\\xa0 We’ll hold it.\\n\\nEvery American should be proud of what our country has achieved in just a short period of time.\\xa0 The U.S. military has deployed thousands of personnel to build 23 temporary hospitals with more than 16,000 beds.\\xa0 And we have the potential to build many more if we needed them, but we’re all ready to go.\\xa0 But I don’t think we’re going to need them, which is great — great news.\\n\\nAnd we built those hospitals in 12 states and the District of Columbia using the Defense Production Act.\\xa0 And we used it like a hammer.\\xa0 A lot of the media said: Oh, we weren’t using it.\\xa0 We used it like a hammer to a point where all we had to do was say the words and everybody gave us max.\\xa0 And they’ve done a good job.\\xa0 They really have done a good job, with few exceptions.\\n\\nAnd we’ve harnessed the full power of American industry to produce ventilators and other essential supplies.\\xa0 Right now, we’re making thousands of ventilators, many of which we won’t need, but we’ll use them in our stockpile.\\xa0 And we’ll build that up.\\xa0 We’ll also help build up the stockpiles, which they should have had in the states.\\xa0 And so we’re working with governors on that, and we’ll also help other countries or countries that are calling us for help, if they need ventilators and they’re in no no position to build ventilators.\\xa0 We are.\\xa0 We have Ford and General Motors, and many, many companies are building ventilators.\\n\\nSo we’re going to be helping — at a not-too-distant point, we’re going to be helping quite a few of the countries.\\n\\nNow, we’ve launched Project Airbridge to deliver nearly 300 million pieces of personal protective equipment from and around the globe.\\xa0 We’re also shipping out 60 sterilization systems to 10 different cities that can each sterilize up to 80,000 masks each day, and I’m even hearing it can go up to 120,000 masks a day — certain equipment with certain additions.\\xa0 It’s a company in Ohio that makes it.\\xa0 It’s a great company.\\xa0 Great — I hear it’s a great product.\\xa0 It works very well.\\n\\nI asked that question; I said, “How come we have to buy so many masks?\\xa0 Why can’t we sterilize the masks that are being used?”\\xa0 And the answer was, “You can.”\\xa0 In this case, they say, up to 20 times.\\xa0 So we can take a mask — certain types of masks — the N95s in particular — and we can sterilize them, make them very clean, up to 20 times.\\xa0 That’s a great thing.\\n\\nIn addition, we passed the largest emergency economic relief package in American history to save the U.S. economy and protect the American worker.\\xa0 As you know, this past week, which was four active days on the stock market — Good Friday today is not — is not included; the markets are closed.\\xa0 In four days, we had the biggest market increase — stock market increase that we’ve had in 50 years.\\xa0 That tells you that there’s a pent-up demand.\\xa0 That tells you they want to get back.\\xa0 There’s something good going to happen.\\xa0 I really believe that.\\xa0 There’s something very good going to happen.\\xa0 We have to get back.\\n\\nSo think of it: In this horrible period, this horrible, dark period where this — this monster came and worked its horrible, horrible spell over the world — 184 countries as of this morning.\\xa0 A hundred and eighty-four countries.\\n\\nWe’ve done well, and I guess the market thinks we’ve done well, because we hit the biggest stock market increase without one day — we’re talking four days instead of five — that we’ve had in 50 years.\\xa0 Fifty years.\\xa0 Think of that.\\xa0 More than 50 years, actually.\\n\\nIn short, the American people have launched the greatest mobilization of our society since World War Two, deploying every scientific, governmental, medical, and military resource to defeat the virus.\\n\\nSo I want to just start then with — we’re going to answer questions later.\\xa0 We’ll have time.\\xa0 I think we have a lot of time today.\\xa0 A lot of people are off, as they should be.\\xa0 Good Friday.\\n\\nBut — so I’ll stick around, and we’ll answer questions later.\\xa0 I want to start with Deborah Birx, please.\\xa0 Dr. Birx.\\xa0 And you can go over some of the numbers we just looked at, and that’d be great.\\n\\nThank you very much, Deborah.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for outlining how well we are doing in a series of metro areas.\\xa0 What also has been encouraging, for those of you who are watching epidemic curves every day — and I’m sure you are, and lot — watching them in log phase, because that’s how epidemiologists like to look at their curves — you can see for the first time that, in the United States, we’re starting to level on the logarithmic phase, like Italy did about a week ago.\\xa0 And so this gives us great heart on that — not only in specific places, but we’re starting to see that change.\\n\\nObviously, a lot of that is driven by the improvement in New York City.\\xa0 Remember, for a long time, they were over 50 percent of our cases and 50 percent of our new cases.\\xa0 That has dramatically changed because of the impact of what the citizens of New York and New Jersey and across Connecticut, and now Rhode Island, are doing to really change the course of this pandemic and really change the trajectory of new cases.\\n\\nWe’re seeing that what many states and metro areas were — experienced as twofold and fourfold — fourfold increases that went to twofold — that now those are going to eight days between the doubling rate.\\xa0 Watching this every day gives us hope across these metro areas, from New York and New Jersey and all through Denver, and of course, through New Orleans.\\n\\nWe still see cases occurring in the Boston area and in Chicago, but their rate of increase seems to be stabilizing.\\xa0 And we really want to call out the work of the mayors of Baltimore and the District and Philadelphia who have really brought all of their health — health experts together and, working with their communities, are starting to really change the curves in those areas.\\n\\nWhat we’re seeing is we’re united in social distancing, and that’s been very encouraging to all of us, and it should be encouraging to the healthcare providers that are on the frontline, many of which are serving our Americans with such dignity and respect and ensuring that everybody gets optimal care.\\n\\nAnd as the President noted, our mortality in the United States is significantly less than many of the other countries when you correct them for our population.\\xa0 And that is really solely the work of our health — our frontline healthcare providers.\\n\\nAnd so working with — you can really — hopefully you get the theme today that we are incredibly proud of our public health leaders at the city level, at the state level, at the federal level who are working together to really change the course of this pandemic, working with their citizens in their communities to make these changes, and the American public who has really taken all of this to heart and stayed home.\\n\\nI know, last week, we really asked a lot of people in the Washington and Baltimore area to consolidate, not go out frequently to grocery stores or pharmacies.\\xa0 You can really see that that’s having a huge impact.\\n\\nSo it’s really about the encouraging signs that we see.\\xa0 But as encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak.\\xa0 And so, every day, we need to continue to do what we did yesterday and the week before and the week before that, because that’s what, in the end, is going to take us up across the peak and down the other side.\\n\\nWe continue to really applaud the work of California and Washington State and Oregon.\\xa0 We’re learning from all three of those states, from their public health officials, about how they were able to keep the virus from ever becoming logarithmic.\\xa0 And I think that’s an important lesson for all of us on how they did that, what the timing was, in case we ever have to face this issue in the future.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much, Deborah.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Tony?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Doctor, please.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Thank you very much, Mr. President.\\xa0 So again, just keeping on the theme that Dr. Birx had mentioned, this is the end of the week — that famous week that we spoke about last weekend — in which we — what actually was predicted to happen, happened.\\xa0 We’re starting to see the leveling off and the coming down that Dr. Birx had mentioned.\\n\\nBut it’s important to remember that this is not the time to feel that since we have made such important advance in the sense of success of the mitigation, that we need to be pulling back at all.\\xa0 I was actually hearkened [sic] by the fact that we’ve been talking about the New York, New Jersey, New Orleans, and other areas where they have really big spikes, but there’s other parts of the country, in the middle parts of the country, where they’re concerned to make sure they don’t get those spikes.\\n\\nAnd I really want to salute the governors of states throughout the entire United States, but particularly in the central part of the country because the governors after they see us in these press conferences.\\xa0 And I’ve had calls over the last several days from several of the governors — you know, from Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Utah.\\xa0 Just about an hour and a half ago, I spoke with the governors of Arkansas and Wyoming, who are really committed to make sure that they don’t get into the situation where they’re going to have spikes in their state.\\xa0 And they’re doing the kinds of things that they don’t get recognized, because people don’t talk about them much.\\n\\nBut we have a big country.\\xa0 We have 50 states.\\xa0 And it’s not only the big cities.\\xa0 So if we’re going to pull out of this, we’re going to pull out of it in the big cities and we’re going to pull out in those areas that aren’t as densely populated.\\n\\nAnd I just want to give a shout out to them.\\xa0 They’re doing an extraordinary job.\\xa0 I was really pleasant- — I wouldn’t say “surprised,” because I expect it of this country — but to hear what they’re doing and the commitment that they’re putting into making sure that we don’t have the kinds of situations that we’ve experienced, unfortunately, in other areas — this is very important.\\n\\nI just want to close by — one other thing, something I mentioned yesterday and the day before — that there are a lot of candidate interventions that are going into clinical trials.\\xa0 For those of you who are interested in it, I recommend you go to ClinicalTrials.gov, and you’ll see the design of a clinical trial, and you’ll see that many of them are the randomized control trials that are the really gold standard of how you find out whether something really is safe and effective.\\xa0 And as the weeks and months — and it’ll probably be months — sometime in the summer, we’ll start to see which are working, which are not.\\xa0 And to focus on those that are — we’re developing and we’re working.\\n\\nI’ll be happy to answer questions later.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please, Doctor.\\n\\nDR. HAHN:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nDR. HAHN:\\xa0 The White House Task Force has been very focused on increasing the supply of personal protective equipment for our great providers.\\xa0 I was one of those providers a few months ago and I can tell you nothing is more important than making sure they have what they need.\\n\\nSo, in order to increase the supply of N95 masks, FDA has worked with industry and has now authorized two companies who will supply machines to sterilize N95 masks.\\n\\nAdmiral Polowczyk and FEMA are purchasing, on behalf of U.S. government, 60 sterilization machines, as mentioned by the President.\\xa0 And they will be positioned around the country to increase the amount of supply of N95 masks.\\n\\nEach machine will be able to sterilize 80,000 95 masks [sic] — N95 masks per day.\\xa0 And we hope to actually increase that further.\\n\\nThe Vice President and the White House Task Force challenged us yesterday, and we responded as a team.\\xa0 FDA issued revised guidance regarding the laundering of gowns because gowns are another issue, in terms of supply, that we’re looking forward on.\\n\\nThis is not something that normally happens around the country, but issued this guidance.\\xa0 It’s on our website now at FDA.\\xa0 So there’s information about how hospitals can do that to increase the supply.\\n\\nWe’ve heard concerns that maybe hospitals might not want to do that because of regulations.\\xa0 And I can — happy to tell you that Administrator Verma and I have worked on this — certified providers and suppliers who follow FDI [sic] — FDA guidance, as posted on the website, will be compliant with Medicare and Medicaid requirements.\\n\\nAnd then finally, last week FDA provided guidance to manufacturers on manufacturing specifications for cloth gowns.\\xa0 This is another attempt to increase the number of gowns.\\xa0 Typically, it’s plastic or other types of materials.\\xa0 And this guidance, if followed, can be used by manufacturers to actually make these gowns and no further regulatory red tape will be necessary.\\xa0 They can go into circulation.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nSURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr.\\xa0 President.\\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\\xa0 I started off the week talking about the challenges that lie ahead, and I want to finish the week just by reiterating what you’ve heard.\\xa0 Mitigation works.\\xa0 It definitively and quantitatively is working.\\xa0 And I want to say thank you to America for your efforts to help flatten the curve and to save lives.\\n\\nBut, at the President’s direction, yesterday, I met with 2,000 Hispanic leaders from their communities.\\xa0 And today, the Vice President led a phone call that I was on with hundreds of African American leaders, including the Reverend Jesse Jackson, including Derrick Johnson of the NAACP, including the National Medical Association and the Black Nurses Association, to talk about some of the alarming trends we’re observing regarding the impact of COVID-19 on communities of color.\\n\\nAnd you’ve heard the stats in New York City: Hispanics represent the majority of deaths.\\xa0 In Milwaukee County, blacks are 25 percent of the population but almost 50 percent of the cases and 75 percent of the deaths.\\xa0 So what’s going on?\\xa0 Well, it’s alarming but it’s not surprising that people of color have a greater burden of chronic health conditions.\\n\\nAfrican Americans and Native Americans develop high blood pressure at much younger ages, and it’s less likely to be under control, and does greater harm to their organs.\\xa0 Puerto Ricans have higher rates of asthma and black boys are three times as likely to die of asthma as their white counterparts.\\xa0 As a matter of fact, I’ve been carrying around an inhaler in my pocket for 40 years out of fear of having a fatal asthma attack.\\xa0 And I hope that showing you this inhaler shows little kids with asthma all across the country that they can grow up to be Surgeon General one day.\\n\\nBut I — more immediately share it so that everyone knows it doesn’t matter if you look fit, if you look young.\\xa0 You are still at risk for getting and spreading and dying from coronavirus.\\n\\nThe chronic burden of medical ills is likely to make people of color especially less resilient to the ravages of COVID-19.\\xa0 And it’s possibly — in fact, likely — that the burden of social ills is also contributing.\\n\\nSocial distancing and teleworking, we know, are critical, and you’ve heard Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci talk about how they prevent the spread of coronavirus.\\xa0 Yet only one in five African Americans and one in six Hispanics has a job that lets them work from home.\\n\\nPeople of color are more likely to live in densely packed areas and in multi-generational housing, which — situations which create higher risk for spread of a highly contagious disease like COVID-19.\\n\\nWe tell people to wash their hands, but as studies showed, 30 percent of the homes on Navajo Nation don’t have running water.\\xa0 So how are they going to do that?\\n\\nIn summary, people of color experience both more likely exposure to COVID-19 and increased complications from it.\\xa0 But let me be crystal clear:\\xa0We do not think people of color are biologically or genetically predisposed to get COVID-19.\\xa0 There is nothing inherently wrong with you.\\xa0 But they are socially predisposed to coronavirus dispos- — exposure and to have a higher incidence of the very diseases that puts you at risk for severe complications of coronavirus.\\n\\nBut as the Vice President shared on the call this morning, this history — and I want you to hear me say this — it does not have to be our nation’s future.\\xa0 We’re taking steps now, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, to reach, protect, and strengthen all communities impacted by this disease, and especially our communities of color.\\n\\nMore details will be forthcoming.\\xa0 But we are actively working, as the Vice President and the CDC director laid out today, on data collection; targeted outreach to communities of color; and increasing financial employment, education, housing, social and health supports, so that everybody has an equal chance to be healthy.\\n\\nAnd I want to close by saying that while your state and local health departments and those of us in public service are working day and night to help stop the spread of COVID-19 and to protect you regardless of your color, your creed, or your geography, I need you to know: You are not helpless.\\xa0 And it’s even more important that, in communities of color, we adhere to the task force guidelines to slow the spread.\\n\\nStay at home, if possible.\\xa0 If you must go out, maintain six feet of distance between you and everyone else, and wear a mask if you’re going to be within six feet of others.\\xa0 Wash your hands more often than you ever dreamed possible.\\xa0 Avoid alcohol, tobacco, and drugs.\\xa0 And call your friends and family.\\xa0 Check in on your mother; she wants to hear from you right now.\\n\\nAnd speaking of mothers, we need you to do this, if not for yourself, then for your abuela.\\xa0 Do it for your granddaddy.\\xa0 Do it for your Big Mama.\\xa0 Do it for your Pop-Pop.\\xa0 We need you to understand — especially in communities of color, we need you to step up and help stop the spread so that we can protect those who are most vulnerable.\\n\\nThis epidemic is a tragedy, but it will be all the more tragic if we fail to recognize and address the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 and an array of other diseases and risk factors on communities of color.\\xa0 The task force and this administration are determined not to let that happen.\\xa0 The President, the Vice President have said we will not let that happen.\\n\\nWe can’t fix these issues overnight, but I promise you we will work with your communities to quickly and meaningfully move the needle in the right direction.\\xa0 Nothing less than the fate of our families and friends, my family and friends depends on it.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Great job.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nMike, please.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Today, the White House Coronavirus Task Force met and — and heard from the President the gratitude then he and I and I know all the American people feel for all the dedicated workers at FEMA, HHS, U.S. Public Health Service, FDA, and all those that are literally working on your behalf around the clock to partner with states, to partner with local health officials.\\xa0 And Mr. President, allow me to add my — my thanks and admiration to all of the entire team here at the federal level.\\n\\nOn this Good Friday, we — we remember those who’ve lost their lives to the coronavirus.\\xa0 We remember their families, our dedicated healthcare workers, and our first responders.\\xa0 And we do well, on this special day for Christians across this country, to remember them in our prayers.\\n\\nBut, as you just heard from Dr. Birx and from the experts, it’s also a good day to remember that Good Friday is always followed by Easter Sunday.\\xa0 And there is hope.\\xa0 There is hope in this moment that, thanks to what the American people are doing every day — adhering to the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America; thanks to the fact that Americans are listening to state and local leaders, and putting the health of their family members and neighbors first, we’re getting there, America.\\xa0 We’re making progress.\\xa0 But it’s imperative that we all continue to implement all of the guidance in the “30 Days to Slow the Spread.”\\n\\nAs the Surgeon General just attested, at the President’s direction, we engaged more than 400 leaders in the African American community today.\\xa0 And allow me to express my appreciation for their leadership and their efforts in communicating to African Americans and other minority populations some of the unique challenges that those communities face in the midst of this epidemic.\\n\\nAnd the CDC, as the Surgeon General said, is working on not only studying the issue, but very rapidly issuing new guidance.\\xa0 And we’ll be communicating that new guidance to all of those great leaders.\\n\\nOn the subject of testing and supplies, the President gave a great amount of detail.\\xa0 More than 2.1 million tests have been performed and we continue to work very, very closely with FDA and suppliers around the country to expand the ability of testing.\\xa0 And you just heard Dr. Hahn reflect on the fact that very soon we will have an antibody test that Americans will be able to take to determine whether they ever had the coronavirus.\\n\\nI spoke today to the governor of Colorado, Jared Polis.\\xa0 And we’ve been in contact with Senator Cory Gardner about an outbreak at a particular meatpacking facility in the Colorado area.\\xa0 And at this time, our team is working with the governor and working with the senator to ensure that we flow testing resources.\\xa0 At this point, there are some 14 people hospitalized, maybe 2- to 300 of the workforce have been impacted.\\xa0 And we spoke about providing those resources this weekend.\\xa0 I want to encourage people in Colorado that we will — we will work to support that effort, but I also want to emphasize that all the people that are working in food supply — from farmers, to meatpackers, to distributors, to truckers, to grocers — continue to have our gratitude, as President Trump said just a few moments ago.\\n\\nOn supplies: More than 5 billion have been obligated to the states, 29,600 National Guard have been activated, and, at the President’s direction, more than 4,700 active duty military personnel have been deployed — medical military personnel — in nine states, focusing on the areas of the most significant epidemic.\\n\\nAir bridge, its 26 flights have been completed.\\xa0 Four flights are scheduled to arrive today, bringing a quarter million gowns, 25 million pairs of gloves.\\xa0 Fifty-four more flights are scheduled, literally bringing in supplies from around the world.\\n\\nFinally, let me say, as we go into this very special weekend — into Easter services.\\xa0 I know I speak on behalf of the President when I say how grateful we are to all of the churches that have been there — and their ministries have been working under great difficulty — to continue to provide for the needs of your members.\\xa0 There have been — there have been food drives, there have been phone calls, and ministry has continued.\\xa0 And we are grateful for the role, on this Holy Week, that our churches, our synagogues, and all of our houses of worship have played.\\n\\nOn their behalf, allow me to remind you that even if you’re not in the pew this Easter Sunday, if you are able, it’s still a good idea to give, because those ministries continue to go forward.\\xa0 And we encourage you — we encourage you to continue to support them.\\n\\nWe also want to say very respectfully to all of the — all the church communities around this country and all the places of worship to continue to heed the guidelines issued in the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America.\\xa0 We know it’s difficult in this time of year, particularly, Mr. President, to avoid gatherings of more than 10.\\xa0 But we’re grateful that so many churches, synagogues, and places of worship have done just that, and we urge you to continue to do it.\\n\\nAnd to my Christian brothers and sisters across the country, let me encourage you with the words we should all remember that Jesus said, “Wherever two or more are gathered, there He is also.”\\xa0 And so you can worship, you can celebrate Easter, and know that you’ll be blessed in so doing.\\xa0 And you’ll be serving the nation.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Great job.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nOkay, it’s Good Friday.\\xa0 Let’s be nice.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 Let’s be real nice.\\xa0 Yeah, please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Can you clarify a little bit what the U.S. offer to Mexico, in order to agree to that oil deal?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And then also go into detail about what you spoke about on oil with President Putin this morning?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So all of the OPEC nations met, and others, and they’re all agreeing to cut back because there’s a tremendous glut.\\xa0 We don’t even — we’re filling up our strategic reserves.\\xa0 We don’t even have room to store it.\\xa0 In fact, they’re using ships to store oil.\\xa0 There’s never been anything like this.\\n\\nIt was being overproduced to start off with, and then you had the virus and that took off 40 percent right there.\\xa0 So we have — there’s a glut of oil like nobody has ever seen before.\\xa0 It’s good in many ways and, depending on where you are, who you are, it’s bad.\\xa0 We have a tremendous energy business with hundreds of thousands of jobs.\\xa0 We’re doing great.\\xa0 Number one in the world.\\n\\nSo, they all got together and they said, “We’re going to cut it, because we have to get rid of this tremendous supply.”\\n\\nNow, the good news is, gasoline prices — I’m seeing 90 cents, 85 cents, in different parts of the country, a gallon.\\xa0 Nobody has ever seen that.\\xa0 I guess you have to go back to the 1950s where they had the big large dollar bills, remember?\\xa0 You don’t remember; you’re too young.\\xa0 But the fact that you have to go back a long ways to see it.\\n\\nSo there’s some good.\\xa0 The airlines are trying to come back, having low fuel costs is good for them — and other reasons.\\xa0 Steel manufacturing — but a lot of the steel goes to building what we do for the oil and engineering firms.\\xa0 So, you know, that’s a — that’s a double-edged sword.\\n\\nBut it’s — it’s — we want to keep our energy.\\xa0 We want to remain independent.\\xa0 We will remain independent, I think, regardless.\\xa0 But we want to get rid of this tremendous overflow.\\xa0 There’s no place to even store it.\\n\\nSo the OPEC nations met.\\xa0 They’ve been meeting.\\xa0 And, you know, I’ve hated OPEC over the years, absolutely hated them.\\xa0 But obviously it broke down and we potentially have years’ worth of supply.\\xa0 A long time before it ever can catch up, even if they do reduce it.\\n\\nAnd they agreed, but Mexico didn’t agree.\\xa0 It was one of the few countries that didn’t agree.\\xa0 This is OPEC-Plus.\\xa0 These are OPEC-Plus countries outside — you understand?\\xa0 And Mexico didn’t agree.\\xa0 And I understand the President very well.\\xa0 He has a level when he came in, and he wanted to keep it at that level.\\xa0 Oil is important for Mexico.\\xa0 The problem is — and I explained it very strongly — you know, you’re going to be selling it for $5 or $10 a barrel.\\xa0 So, in the end, it’s bad.\\n\\nBut he did have some political difficulty with it, frankly, and I understand that too.\\xa0 And it’s a small amount for us.\\xa0 It’s a large amount for Mexico, but it’s a very small amount for the United States, being the biggest producer.\\xa0 So I agreed to pick up some of the slack.\\xa0 So he was going to reduce it by 100,000 barrels — reduce his output by 100,000 barrels.\\xa0 And I was going to pick up the slack and they would make it up to us at a later date.\\xa0 They would make up what we’re doing at a later date.\\xa0 It could be in a different form.\\n\\nAnd I don’t know whether or not that’s going to be — for Mexico, it was acceptable.\\xa0 I don’t know whether or not that’s going to be acceptable to the other oil-producing nations.\\xa0 We’ll find out.\\xa0 But it’s something that would certainly be acceptable to me to get it over the back.\\xa0 So Mexico is going to reduce by 100,000 barrels, and that would mean that they’re 250 to 300 barrels short.\\xa0 We’d make up the difference.\\xa0 They would reimburse us at a later date.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You mean make up the difference by cutting U.S. production?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 By cutting some U.S. production.\\xa0 Now, the U.S, production has already been cut, because we’re a market-driven economy and — and oil is very market driven.\\xa0 They’ve been cutting oil all over the place.\\xa0 We’re cutting it back.\\n\\nAnd what does it mean really?\\xa0 It means we have it in the ground.\\xa0 We can use it.\\xa0 Now we have a lot of — we have a lot of ground with a lot of oil in it.\\xa0 I think we’re number one in that too.\\xa0 We’re probably number one, especially with ANWR.\\xa0 As you know, I got ANWR approved in Alaska.\\xa0 That’s one of the biggest finds anywhere in the world.\\n\\nSo when you add it all up, I think we’re probably number one, even in what we have under- — we’re very lucky.\\xa0 We were — we grew up in a land that was rich in a lot of ways, but it’s also rich because it has a lot of oil underneath — oil and gas.\\n\\nAnd as, you know, natural gas — LNG — is all over the country now at a very low price.\\xa0 And our carbon, our atmosphere, our — the level of environmental cleanliness is at its all-time best right now.\\xa0 All-time best.\\xa0 Because we are using a lot of natural gas.\\n\\nBut we have many forms of energy, including some of the newer forms that people want to see us go to. \\xa0We have a lot of different forms of energy.\\xa0 We’re number one in the world.\\xa0 We want to keep it that way.\\n\\nSo we’re helping Mexico out.\\xa0 We will be reimbursed, in a form, sometime in the future.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I want to ask about the new federal projections in a moment.\\xa0 But first, today, you tweeted “The Invisible Enemy will soon be in full retreat!”\\xa0 Given it’s invisible, without widespread testing how would you know?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think we’re going to have it in retreat.\\xa0 Will it be today?\\xa0 No.\\xa0 Tomorrow?\\xa0 No.\\xa0 But it will be — at a certain point in the not-too-distant future, it will be gone.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But how do you know that without the widespread testing is specifically my question.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’ll know.\\xa0 We’ll know because people aren’t going to go to the hospital, people aren’t going to get sick.\\xa0 You’re going to know that without — but we’re going to do very substantial testing.\\xa0 We’re doing more testing right now than any other country in the world by far.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But it’s still fewer than 1 percent of our population —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And if you’d like to have that question answered, I’ll have the professional answer it.\\xa0 Deborah, perhaps you could come up.\\xa0 We are doing tremendous testing, but you’ll know.\\xa0 You’re going to know before anybody, because you’re going to see nobody’s getting sick anymore.\\xa0 It will be gone, and it won’t be that much longer.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’ll ask about the projections after.\\xa0 Thanks, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 So, the testing, I want to reemphasize about what kind of testing we’re talking about.\\xa0 This is RNA diagnostic testing.\\xa0 That is the platform that was built to respond to this epidemic.\\xa0 It is the same platform that we utilize for HIV viral loads, and so many HIV clients have also given up their space on the machines to have these tests run for all of Americans.\\n\\nThis assay is complicated.\\xa0 It’s not like an assay that you have for your other diseases — your strep test or other diseases like that.\\xa0\\xa0This is a very complicated assay that requires a lot of technical oversight and it’s part of the reason why not all 100 percent our machines are running at full capacity.\\xa0 But we had great discussion with the lab directors about that.\\n\\nEvery day, more are brought online.\\xa0 And so — but I think we have to create expectations of what the daily test rates will be.\\xa0 Last year, we probably did 3 million HIV viral loads or 4 million HIV viral loads as a country.\\xa0 We’ve done over 2- — almost 2.2 million in four weeks.\\xa0 So this is unprecedented in what we have to do.\\n\\nI think that’s why we’re working very hard for two pieces.\\xa0 And I want to make sure that people understand: Testing is just part of our strategy.\\xa0 The other part of the strategy has to be this syndromic and influenza-like illness, where there’s an alert to an illness.\\xa0 And so that we’re surveying where we know the most vulnerable cases have appeared.\\n\\nAnd the great call that I had with the mayors and with the health officials yesterday and mayors today — a lot in the rural areas, their primary — and as it was in Washington and California — it was at the nursing homes.\\n\\nSo the issue is to build a testing strategy that speaks to our strengths of laser focusing a strategic approach to testing when we know what our volumes are — and they increase every day, but we have to be realistic about what the volumes will be a week, two weeks, three weeks from now — and combine that with strategic surveillance so that we’re testing symptomatic people and their contacts very quickly — to go back to contact tracing, utilizing our complete strategy.\\n\\nAnd I think we’re very much interested — and it’s why the President, three weeks ago, really put us on getting an antibody test.\\xa0 And I think — I called from the podium for our university colleagues and unive- — and hospitals to begin an ELISA-based test, because that’s a blood draw.\\xa0 But we really wanted a finger prick to make it easy and deployable.\\n\\nThat’s what’s being worked on now.\\xa0 Of course, we don’t want to promise until we have it because I think we deserve that, the American people deserve that: to have a test that is efficient to let people know who has been positive for immunity.\\xa0 That’s critical to epidemiologists and public health officials to know what the penetrance of a virus was into a community, when all you’re seeing are the serious cases and testing the most symptomatic.\\n\\nAnd so that’s a question that we still have: Is this the tip of the iceberg or is this half the iceberg or three quarters of the iceberg — what we have seen to date?\\n\\nAnd we have — I just want to complete the thought by saying: In the areas where we had an outbreak, these large metros — Louisiana, Denver, Detroit, Chicago, New York, New Jersey — but, per capita, we’ve done more tests than any other place in the world.\\xa0 That was intentional.\\xa0 We focused the tests where the need was the greatest and the burden of disease the greatest.\\xa0 And now we’re trying to really see how strategically that very valuable resource can be utilized around the country to create a mosaic of testing combined with surveillance.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I ask about the new federal projections?\\xa0 There’s new reporting today — the new federal projections suggest —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Let you ask who?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’d like to ask you, if I can, about the new federal projections that suggest lifting the 30-day shelter-in-place orders would lead to a spike in infections.\\xa0 Have you seen those new projections from your Department of Homeland Security and HHS, first of all?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I have not.\\xa0 When did they say this would take place?\\xa0 When?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 They said that it would take place if the 30-day shelter-in-place were to be removed.\\xa0 They’re three different example —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, well, we’ll talk about that.\\xa0 Doctor, would you like to talk about that?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So does that impact your thinking though that those —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 We haven’t seen the documents.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I haven’t — they haven’t seen it.\\xa0 I guess, you’re seeing — I guess they leaked it to NBC.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 They didn’t leak it to us.\\xa0 It’s being reported by others.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Nobody has it.\\xa0 And they’re the ones that do it, so.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s your administration, so I asked.\\xa0 It’s from the HHS and DOJ.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’ll circle back in a sec- —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’ll find out about it.\\xa0 They don’t know about it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So in terms —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Do you want to say something, Tony?\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 First of all, Peter, I haven’t seen that, so I can’t quote on that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But New York Times just reported it with the last four hours.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 That’s okay.\\xa0 I still haven’t seen it.\\xa0 I’ve been here all day.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I understand.\\xa0 I’m just saying it wasn’t leaked to me; I’m just telling you what I’ve seen.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 So, what I think — what — that they’re talking about is that whenever you pull back, you would expect that you might start seeing cases.\\xa0 And what we’ve been talking about — what Dr. Birx has just mentioned — is that when you see that, that’s where you want your resources to be able to very efficiently, in real-time, identify, isolate, and contact trace.\\n\\nSo, don’t let anyone get any false ideas that when we decide at a proper time when we’re going to be relaxing some of the restrictions, there’s no doubt you’re going to see cases.\\xa0 I would be so surprised if we did not see cases.\\xa0 The question is how you respond to them.\\n\\nI think that’s what they were referring to.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I guess, the question, Mr. President: Should Americans have to decide between staying healthy and going back to work?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Look, I think we’re going to do both.\\xa0 We’re going to go back to work and we’re going to stay healthy.\\xa0 And staying healthy is also a proportion.\\xa0 If you look at what we’re doing, we’re looking at a date — we hope we’re going to be able to fulfill a certain date — but we’re not doing anything until we know that this country is going to be healthy.\\xa0 We don’t want to go back and start doing it over again, even though it would be in a smaller scale.\\n\\nYeah, Jeff.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir. \\xa0Just a follow-up on the oil question.\\xa0 The President of Mexico said that you had agreed that the U.S. would cut production by 250,000 barrels per day.\\xa0 Is that what you agreed to?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes, we would — which we’ve already done, by the way.\\xa0 But we would agree to a reduction cut; they would agree to do something to compensate us in the future.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Did you make any assurances to Saudi Arabia that you, the United States would not bail out oil drillers here?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We didn’t discuss that with Saudi Arabia.\\xa0 We just discussed the numbers and we discussed who is opposed and who is not.\\xa0 And pretty much everybody is in favor of it, because they’re getting clobbered.\\xa0 They’re all getting clobbered.\\xa0 All of those countries are having problems.\\n\\nIf you look at Saudi Arabia, that’s their source of income — primary source of income, by far.\\xa0 So they want to do it. Russia wants to do it.\\xa0 The OPEC nations want to do it.\\xa0 They all want to do it.\\xa0 So we’ll see what happens.\\xa0 There’s a difference between wanting to do it and doing it.\\n\\nYeah, go ahead.\\xa0 OAN, in the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 This is a national security question, back to Venezuela and China.\\xa0 This morning —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Venezuela.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Your administration has placed a $15 million bounty on Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro.\\xa0 And we have news this morning that President Xi is talking with Nicolas Maduro, expressing his financial support for Maduro.\\xa0 So, two questions: One, have you discussed with Dr. Xi — President Xi the U.S. policy on Maduro?\\xa0 And two, are — how does this affect U.S. policy with regards to its war on anti-narcotics?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 We will not be happy if that takes place.\\xa0 I have not spoken to President Xi of China about Venezuela — about that aspect of Venezuela.\\xa0 But if that took place, we will not be happy.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 I will not be happy.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you concerned that he is opening up another financial avenue with him?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m concerned about everything.\\xa0 I’m concerned about everything.\\xa0 That’s why I don’t sleep a lot.\\xa0 I get myself concerned about everything.\\xa0 But I would not be happy about that.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, getting back to Peter’s question — a variation of that question.\\xa0 Your doctors who are gathered here seem to be in doubt as to whether or not the country could reopen on May the 1st.\\xa0 If they come to you before May the 1st and say the country is not ready or huge parts of the country are not ready to reopen on May the 1st, will you listen to them?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I listen to them about everything.\\xa0 I think they’re actually surprised.\\xa0 I have great respect for these people.\\xa0 All of them.\\xa0 You, look —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But those — that recommendation in particular —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And others that are working with us.\\xa0 I have great respect for this group.\\xa0 In fact, I told Tony Fauci — I said, “Why don’t you move to New York, run against AOC?\\xa0 You will win easily.”\\xa0 But he decided that he’s not going to do that, okay?\\xa0 I kid.\\xa0 By the way —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Some of your allies have been bashing these doctors.\\xa0 Some of your allies have been bashing —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — you know that —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Some — some of your allies have been bashing these doctors.\\xa0 Would you tell them to cut it out?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I can only say this: I have tremendous respect for these people and we’ve done very well. \\xa0And when you look at us compared to others — we’re a big nation.\\xa0 When you look at us compared to others, when you see how we’ve taken testing from a broken system that I inherited to having the best tests that anyone has made anywhere in the world — and other countries are calling us, wanting to use our technology.\\xa0 I have great respect for these people.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But if they come back to you, sir —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m never saying bad about these people.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If they come back to you, sir, and say, before May the 1st, “We can’t open on May the 1st,” do you listen?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I will certainly listen.\\xa0 I will certainly listen.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Will you take that advice?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 There are two sides.\\xa0 Remember, there is — I know — I understand the other side of the argument very well because I look at both sides of an argument.\\xa0 I will listen to them very carefully though.\\n\\nPlease.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 You may have seen this, but JPMorgan came out with a forecast about GDP growth in the second quarter, and they’re saying a 40 percent decline in the second quarter of this year.\\xa0 Do your economic advisors share that view?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think my economic advisors are interested in the third quarter and really the fourth quarter.\\xa0 And I think we have a chance to do record fourth quarter numbers, because there’s a tremendous pent-up demand.\\xa0 And you see it this week — I mean, what reason would there be, other than faith in us and in this country?\\xa0 Faith in this group — and me, and our Vice President, and everybody.\\xa0 Governors, perhaps.\\xa0 You can add them into it also.\\xa0 What reason would that be for — in a shortened week, four days instead of five — to have the biggest stock market gain in over 50 years?\\xa0 So, I think that — you know, to me, there’s a sign.\\n\\nHey, look, with all we’ve been down — I mean, we’ve — we’ve never been hit — I don’t know, has this country ever been hit like this?\\xa0 Probably not.\\xa0 1917, but that was different, and it was a different time, and, frankly, Europe took the brunt of it.\\xa0 We didn’t, but it was a terrible time also.\\xa0 But, probably, never been hit like this, right?\\n\\nSomebody was saying — in fact, I was speaking with Governor Cuomo about it.\\xa0 Because we were in New York City — a place we love, New York State — with the World Trade Center.\\xa0 And that was approximately 3,000 people.\\xa0 Well, we’ve doubled that.\\xa0 In this same area, we’ve doubled that — more than doubled it, substantially more.\\xa0 And it’s obviously going.\\xa0 You know, we had our highest number yesterday and the day before.\\n\\nOkay.\\xa0 With all of this news, what would lead you to believe that we’re going to have the best stock market week — shortened week — in 50 years?\\xa0 Almost broke the all-time record.\\xa0 You know what that is?\\xa0 That’s a pent-up demand.\\xa0 Now, that’s my opinion.\\n\\nThe other thing is we’re doing tremendous stimulus plans.\\xa0 And despite what you’re reading — you know, there’s back and forth, but we are getting along with the Democrats.\\xa0 They want to see something happen.\\xa0 We have to help our workers.\\xa0 We have to help our small businesses.\\xa0 We have to help — we have to help our restaurants.\\xa0 I think deductibility will be great for entertainment, restaurants, all of it.\\n\\nLook, I think, with the stimulus, with the people, with what we’ve got going, with all of the things — we’re going to be meeting with the airlines over the weekend.\\xa0 We have a great plan for the airlines.\\xa0 We’ve got to keep the airlines going.\\xa0 You know, it’s never been a great business, but it’s a very vital business for the country.\\n\\nWe’re going to be meeting with Boeing.\\xa0 We’re going to be meeting with a lot of companies that are great companies and were great companies a short while ago.\\xa0 I mean, we can’t let anything happen to Boeing.\\xa0 It’s, you know, got so much potential.\\xa0 You talk about potential — can anything have more potential than that?\\n\\nSo, we have a lot of very exciting things taking place.\\xa0 We have tremendous plans.\\xa0 We have tremendous stimulus.\\xa0 And I think we have a chance to do really well.\\n\\nSo this quarter isn’t the quarter I’m looking at.\\xa0 Third quarter, we start to think about it.\\xa0 And I think fourth quarter is going to be at a level that, maybe, we haven’t seen before.\\n\\nI think our country — with the stimulus, with all that we’ve been through — we’ve learned a lot.\\xa0 Don’t forget, we’ve learned about pandemics and epidemics.\\xa0 We’ve learned a tremendous amount.\\xa0 And with all that we’ve learned — as an example, we’re making ventilators.\\xa0 We have thousands of them being delivered in the very near future.\\xa0 We have countries calling us: “Can we have ventilators?”\\xa0 That would have been an unthinkable call.\\xa0 I’d be — I wouldn’t know what to say.\\xa0 They have people dying, but we needed them for ourselves. We have plenty before the surge.\\xa0 In New York, they need far fewer hospital rooms or far fewer hospital beds, in particular, than we thought.\\n\\nAnd I have to say, Dr. Birx told me that four weeks ago, six weeks ago.\\xa0 I remember you said, “That number is too high.\\xa0 We don’t need that many.”\\xa0 And based on what she said, and others, we did what we had to do.\\xa0 We actually gave the maximum.\\xa0 We built Javits.\\xa0 We sent the ship in.\\xa0 We then made the ship COVID, because, you know, there weren’t a lot of people on the roads; you didn’t have the accidents that we thought — other unrelated accidents.\\xa0 There’s nobody driving.\\xa0 You know, normally you have a lot of car accidents.\\xa0 You have a lot of motorcycle accidents.\\xa0 You have people going to the hos- — we didn’t have that.\\xa0 We had almost none of it.\\xa0 So, a lot of things have happened.\\n\\nI think we have a chance to be stronger than before.\\xa0 I really do.\\xa0 I think the stimulus is very important.\\xa0 What we’re doing — I think it’s very, very important.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I ask —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, may I ask you about credit and debt as well?\\xa0 Many American individuals, families have had to tap their credit cards during this period of time.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And businesses have had to draw down their credit lines.\\xa0 Are you concerned, Mr. President, that that may hobble the U.S. economy — all of that debt, number one?\\xa0 And number two, would you suggest to credit card companies to reduce their fees during this time?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it’s something that we’ve already suggested.\\xa0 We’re talking to them.\\xa0 Business interruption insurance.\\xa0 I’d like to see these insurance companies — you know, you have people that have paid — when I was in private, I had business interruption.\\n\\nWhen my business was interrupted through a hurricane or whatever it may be, I’d have business where I had it.\\xa0 I didn’t always have it.\\xa0 Sometimes I had it; sometimes I have a lot of different companies.\\xa0 But if I had it, I’d expect to be paid.\\xa0 You have people — I speak mostly to the restauranteurs, where they have a restaurant, they’ve been paying for 25, 30, 35 years — business interruption.\\xa0 They’ve never needed it.\\xa0 All of a sudden, they need it.\\xa0 And I’m very good at reading language.\\xa0 I did very well in these subjects.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 And I don’t see the word “pandemic” mentioned.\\n\\nNow, in some cases, it is.\\xa0 It’s an exclusion.\\xa0 But in a lot of cases, I don’t see it.\\xa0 I don’t see a reference, and they don’t want to pay up.\\xa0 I would like to see the insurance companies pay if they need to pay, if it’s fair.\\xa0 And they know what’s fair and I know what’s fair.\\xa0 I can tell you very quickly.\\n\\nBut business interruption insurance, that’s getting a lot of money to a lot of people.\\xa0 And they’ve been paying for years.\\xa0 You know, sometimes they just started paying.\\xa0 But you have people that have never asked for business interruption insurance, and they’ve been paying a lot of money for a lot of years for the privilege of having it.\\xa0 And then when they finally need it, the insurance company says, “We’re not going to give it.”\\xa0 We can’t let that happen.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 On March 6th, you said anyone who wants a test can get a test.\\xa0 Now you’re saying that there — that you would be open to reopening the government without having a national testing system.\\xa0 How do you square those two statements, given that there’s still issues with testing going forward?\\xa0 And how can you tell people —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, there’s not a lot of issues with this.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — that they’re not going to have their lives put at risk?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 I got it.\\xa0 There’s not a lot.\\xa0 And it’s a good question.\\xa0 There’s not a lot of issues with testing.\\n\\nCertain sections of the — if we go to Iowa, we go to Nebraska, we go — and interestingly, Idaho is very interesting because they had a few breakouts, small breakouts.\\xa0 But they’re very, very capable states and they’re big distances.\\xa0 A lot of land.\\xa0 A lot of opening.\\xa0 You don’t need testing there, you know, where you have a state with a small number of cases.\\xa0 Some states with almost none.\\xa0 West Virginia hung in for a long time, as you know, with none — for a long time.\\n\\nSo when you have that, you don’t need testing.\\xa0 You don’t have to test every person in the state of Iowa, as an example.\\xa0 You don’t have to test every single person to say, “Let’s open up and let’s get the tractors moving, and let’s get the corn,” and let’s open up all of the different things they do in that great state.\\xa0 You don’t need that.\\n\\nWith that being said, if there’s a little hot corner someplace, we’ll be testing.\\xa0 But I think Deborah speaks to this very well.\\xa0 Same thing in New York.\\xa0 That’s what we talked to Governor Cuomo about this morning.\\xa0 We have the Abbott test, which is very quick and very easy.\\xa0 It goes very fast.\\xa0 Then we have a lesser test that we talked about where we can talk about a larger area.\\n\\nBut you’re going to know — so we’re going to do testing, but you don’t need to test 325 to 350 million people, because, number one, it’s unnecessary.\\xa0 Vast numbers — vast areas of our country don’t need this.\\xa0 I think you agree with me on that.\\xa0 You just don’t need it.\\n\\nNow, we have certain hotspots.\\xa0 So, Louisiana is a hotspot.\\xa0 New York is a hotspot.\\xa0 Detroit is a hotspot.\\xa0 And then you have certain areas in certain hotspots that you have to even go more so.\\xa0 And we’re doing all of that.\\n\\nRemember this: We’ve done more testing than any country in the world.\\xa0 And we have the best tests.\\xa0 And we’ve developed this over a very short period of time.\\n\\nPlease.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I ask you also about the African American disparity?\\xa0 Because I have a —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — question for you and a question for the Surgeon General.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 For you, Mr.\\xa0President: We know that these health disparities have existed for a long time among African Americans, Latinos, and other people of color.\\xa0 Why didn’t the administration possibly have a plan directed at those communities to prevent high death rates, knowing that the health disparities were there?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we do have a plan.\\xa0 And one of the things I’m most proud about is what I’ve been able to do for the African American community: the lowest job numbers in the history of our country.\\xa0 This was —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m talking about for the virus, of course.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Excuse me.\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Just before the virus came — well, I’m just saying, because you know, this has been here for three weeks, right?\\xa0 So, just before, African American community had the lowest unemployment, the best employment numbers.\\xa0 More African American people and communities have been thriving.\\n\\nIf you look at our Opportunity Zones and what we did — Tim Scott, who’s fantastic, a fantastic senator, came to me: Opportunity Zones.\\xa0 More jobs for African Americans than ever before.\\xa0 Better healthcare than they’ve ever had before.\\xa0 All of these things.\\n\\nThe Surgeon General spoke to it, and he spoke to it, I thought, really brilliantly.\\xa0 I found it very interesting what he said.\\xa0 And I’d love you to come up and answer the second part of her question because I think you’re — you would do a much better job than I would.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Surgeon General.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 I have a quick question for you.\\xa0 You — you’ve said that African Americans and Latinos should avoid alcohol, drugs, and tobacco.\\xa0 You also said, “Do it for your abuela and do it for Big Mama and Pop-Pop.”\\xa0 There are some people already —\\n\\nSURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:\\xa0 I said “granddaddy” too.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There’s some people online that are already offended by that language and the idea that you’re saying behaviors might be leading to these high death rates.\\xa0 Could you talk about whether or not people — could you, I guess, have a response for people who might be offended by the language that you used?\\n\\nSURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:\\xa0 Well, I used that language because that’s the language — I’ve been meeting with the NAACP, with the National Medical Association, with others.\\xa0 I actually talked with — with Derrick Johnson multiple times this week, the head of the NAACP, and we need targeted outreach to the African American community.\\n\\nAnd I used the language that is used in my family.\\xa0 I have a Puerto Rican brother-in-law.\\xa0 I call my granddaddy “granddaddy.”\\xa0 I have relatives who call their — their grandparents “Big Mama.”\\xa0 So that was not meant to be offensive.\\xa0 That’s the language that we use and that I use.\\n\\nAnd we need to continue to target our outreach to those communities.\\xa0 It is critically important that they understand it’s not just about them, and I was very clear about that.\\xa0 It’s not just about what you do, but you also are not helpless.\\n\\nWe need to do our part at the federal level.\\xa0 We need people to do their parts at the state level.\\xa0 And we need everyone — black, brown, white, whatever color you are — to follow the President’s guidelines, the coronavirus guidelines, and do their part.\\xa0 Because when I talked to the NAACP three weeks ago, it’s important to note that one of the things they asked me was, “Can you help dispel the myths in this community that people actually can’t get coronavirus if they’re black?” That was a myth that was out there that’s actually very important for us to squash here.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So do you recommend that all Americans avoid tobacco, alcohol, and drug use at this time?\\n\\nSURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:\\xa0 Absolutely.\\xa0 It’s especially important for people who are at risk and with comorbidities.\\xa0 But, yes, all Americans.\\n\\nSo, thank you, and I will clarify that.\\xa0 All Americans need to avoid these substances at all times.\\xa0 I’ve put out a smoking cessation report in January.\\xa0 I put out a advisory against youths and pregnant women using marijuana last year.\\xa0 And that was not directed towards any one race.\\xa0 That’s everybody needs to do everything they can to be as healthy as possible at this critical time.\\n\\nDr. Fauci, would you add anything?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 No, I think you said it perfectly, Jerome.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Would you like to add anything to it?\\xa0 Because you are really — you expressed it very beautifully before.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 No, I mean — Jerome, you did it beautifully.\\xa0 (Laughs.)\\xa0 I can’t do it any better than that.\\xa0 And I know Jerome personally, and I can just testify that he made no — not even a hint of being offensive at all with that comment.\\xa0 I thought that was appropriate.\\xa0 Thanks.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And I can tell you Jerome has done a fantastic job — our Surgeon General.\\xa0 I just hope nobody steals him and he goes to one of these big companies for a fortune.\\xa0 Don’t leave us.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 Don’t leave us, Jerome.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nSURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:\\xa0 I’m happy serving the people, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He’s doing a great — you are happy and you’re doing a great job.\\xa0 And everybody — everybody tells me that too.\\xa0 So we appreciate it.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 So Google and Apple have announced that they are jointly enabling contact tracing on their mobile phone operating systems.\\xa0 And I was wondering if this is something that you would consider or maybe the doctors would consider for —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, that’s individual freedoms, problems and —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — the federal government.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0 — a lot of other things.\\xa0 Is it something we’re going to look at it?\\xa0 Certainly.\\xa0 And we know they’ve done that.\\xa0 And it’s highly — it’s very new.\\xa0 New technology.\\xa0 It’s very interesting.\\xa0 But a lot of people worry about it in terms of a person’s freedom.\\xa0 We’re going to take a look at that.\\xa0 A very strong look at it.\\xa0 We’ll let you know pretty soon.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And I have another question.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Brand new.\\xa0 Yes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So can you explain why it is appropriate, in the middle of a pandemic, to be talking about cutting or eliminating funding for the World Health Organization?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re going to talk about the WHO next week in great detail.\\xa0 I didn’t want to do it today — Good Friday.\\xa0 I didn’t want to do it before Easter.\\xa0 I also didn’t want to do it before we have all the facts.\\n\\nBut over the years, many years, we’ve been paying them from 300 to 500, and even more, million dollars a year.\\xa0 China has been paying them less than 40 over the years.\\xa0 So we’re paying them more than 10 times more than China.\\xa0 And they are very, very China-centric, as I said during the week.\\xa0 China-centric.\\n\\nChina always seems the to get the better of the — the argument, and I don’t like that.\\xa0 I really don’t like that.\\xa0 I don’t think that’s appropriate.\\xa0 I don’t think it’s fair to the American people.\\xa0 And, you know, I tell that to President Xi.\\xa0 I tell that to Dr. Tedros.\\xa0 I spoke to him one time.\\xa0 I think he’s a very nice man.\\xa0 I liked him.\\n\\nBut we’re going to be talking about that next week in great detail.\\xa0 We’re looking at it very, very closely.\\xa0 We want to make sure money is properly spent.\\n\\nBut again, why is the United States paying $500 million a year?\\xa0 It’s a lot.\\xa0 And why is — okay?\\xa0 That’s a lot.\\xa0 And why is China paying — last year, this year — $42 million?\\xa0 But generally under $40 [million].\\xa0 So it’s in the 30s.\\n\\nSo we’re at 500, 452, 400, 401 — different amounts, different years.\\xa0 And they’re at 40, 38, 36, 35, 32, 31.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But why now —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0 No, no.\\xa0 But — but you have to ask yourself that question.\\xa0 And then the answer always turns out to be in China’s favor.\\xa0 Well, I have the same thing with the World Trade.\\xa0 Isn’t it interesting?\\xa0 World Trade.\\xa0 So we have World Health and we have World Trade.\\xa0 So we have the World Trade Organization.\\xa0 And until I came along, we were losing cases — so many cases.\\xa0 It was ridiculous.\\xa0 We were always losing these cases.\\xa0 I mean, almost every case.\\xa0 And now we’re winning cases.\\xa0 We just won $7 billion because they know I’m not going to put up with it.\\n\\nChina has been — unbelievably taken advantage of us and other countries.\\xa0 You know, for instance, they’re considered a developing nation.\\xa0 I said, “Well, then make us a developing nation too.”\\xa0 They get big advantages because they’re a developing nation.\\xa0 India, a developing nation.\\xa0 The United States is the big developed nation.\\xa0 Well, we have plenty of development to do.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nAnd now we’re winning cases because they know that if we’re not treated fairly, I’m going to pull out.\\xa0 Now, you never heard this before because nobody ever talked about the World Trade Organization.\\xa0 But the World Trade Organization has treated us very unfairly.\\xa0 But they know I’m not going to put up with it because all of these countries are taking advantage of the United States.\\n\\nNow, in the courts and the court system, we’re not approving new judges over the last year.\\xa0 We’re not going to approve them.\\xa0 And Bob Lighthizer is working very hard on that.\\n\\nBut we had always a minority position, meaning numbers of judges.\\xa0 So we’d have a minority number of judges.\\xa0 I said, “How do you win with a minority number of judges?”\\xa0 But all of a sudden, we’re winning.\\xa0 And the reason we’re winning is they know if they don’t treat us properly — and we won $7 billion just this very recently.\\xa0 And the money is pouring in.\\xa0 And we won other cases too.\\xa0 We won a lot of cases.\\n\\nBut you know from covering it — I know you know — that the United States was taken advantage of by the World Trade Organization.\\n\\nAnd, by the way, speaking of China: If you look at the history of China, it was only since they went into the World Trade Organization that they became a rocket ship with their economy.\\xa0 They were flat-lined for years and years.\\xa0 Frankly, for many, many decades.\\xa0 And it was only when they came into the World Trade Organization that they became a rocket ship because they took advantage of all there is.\\xa0 I’m not even blaming them.\\xa0 I’m saying, how stupid were the people that stood here and allowed it to happen?\\xa0 But we don’t allow that to happen.\\xa0 And if they don’t treat us fairly, we’ll leave.\\xa0 But now we’re starting to win cases.\\n\\nHow about somebody new for a change?\\xa0 Come on.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Hi, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 As many schools and school districts are closing across the country, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has not ruled out closing — or opening up schools in May, saying that many kids are not vulnerable to this disease.\\xa0 Do you agree with that assessment?\\xa0\\xa0 And do you believe that schools — would you recommend that schools open up?\\xa0 And to those states that have a lot of cases —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I have a lot of confidence in Ron DeSantis, a lot of faith in Ron DeSantis to make the right decision.\\xa0 He’s doing a great job as governor.\\xa0 Ron DeSantis, I had read where he’s thinking about opening up the schools earlier than the date — the end of the month.\\xa0 I’d have to look at the numbers.\\n\\nBut again, you know, I like to allow governors to make decisions without overruling them, because from a constitutional standpoint, that’s the way it should be done.\\xa0 If I disagreed, I would overrule a governor, and I have that right to do it.\\xa0 But I’d rather have them — you can call it “federalist,” you can call it “the Constitution,” but I call it “the Constitution.”\\xa0 I would rather have them make their decisions.\\n\\nBut he’s made a lot of good decisions.\\xa0 And he hasn’t said he’s going to, but he’s thinking about it.\\xa0 So I’ll take a look at it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m wondering if I can ask a follow-up to one of the doctors.\\xa0 If you allow children back into schools, you know, wouldn’t that pose a threat to spreading the virus even further to some of those vulnerable people?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think the answer is obvious, but if you want, either — would you want to just talk about that maybe?\\xa0 Tony?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 She kicks me up here right now.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I know.\\xa0 I can see.\\xa0 (Laughs.)\\xa0 I think — I think they know the answer to that.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah, I mean, from — from pure public health issues is that, if you have a situation in which you don’t have a real good control over an outbreak and you allow children to gather together, they likely will get infected.\\xa0 And if they get infected, the likelihood that they will bring the infection home.\\xa0 So that really is a risk.\\n\\nI don’t know the situation at all in any detail, and I’m not specifically speaking about Florida.\\xa0 I’m just speaking generically about what happens when you have infections in the community, and you have a congregation of people, such as in classrooms, that that’s a risk.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Has anyone under 25 died, Dr. Fauci, in the country?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Deb.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The governor — the governor said —\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — that no one under 25 has died.\\xa0 And I guess you could clarify that people under 25 can die as a result of this.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 A community in Florida (inaudible).\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah, I’m not sure.\\xa0 Again, I —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 In the country?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Okay, let’s do that, because I don’t want to have to be answering for —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Fair enough.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 — a particular state.\\xa0 Yes, people under 25 have died of coronavirus disease in the United States of America.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If you reopen the country in May and there is a new outbreak or a spike in infections, are you open to the idea of shutting the country down again?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Depending on the outbreak, yeah. Depending.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You would be open to it?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And that’s happened, as you know, with a couple of countries.\\n\\nYou know what I’m doing?\\xa0 I’m watching other countries.\\xa0 In many cases, they’re ahead of us from the standpoint that it attacked them before us.\\xa0 It hit them first.\\xa0 And I’m watching what’s happening with respect to certain other countries — some of them obvious, some of them less obvious — and what they’re doing and the success that they’re having.\\xa0 And that’s going to play a large part of the role.\\n\\nI’m also — we’re also setting up a council of very, very great doctors and business people.\\xa0\\xa0 We’re going to be announcing it on Tuesday — of some great people.\\xa0 The —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is this the economic task force?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 As a second task force?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Beyond — this is beyond economic.\\xa0 This is really — I call it, “The Opening Our Country Task Force” or “Opening Our Country Council,” so we don’t get it confused with Mike’s task force, which has done so great.\\xa0 And we’re going to have the great business leaders, great doctors.\\xa0 We’re going to have a great group of people.\\n\\nWe’ll probably do it by teleconference, because we don’t really want them traveling in, for their own purposes.\\xa0 I don’t think it would look good, also.\\xa0 But we don’t want them traveling in.\\xa0 So we’ll do teleconference.\\n\\nWe did one the other day with the banks, and it was very successful — the teleconference itself.\\n\\nAnd we’ll be announcing names on Tuesday, who’s on that.\\xa0 And that’ll play a role.\\xa0\\xa0 But ultimately, I have to make that decision.\\xa0 And then I’ll have to make a decision: Do we close a little area that’s a hotspot?\\n\\nI do say this, Jim: I want to get it open as soon as possible.\\xa0 This country was meant to be open and vibrant and great, not where people are, you know, staying in.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you determined to do it by May 1st?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I’m not — I am — I would love to open it.\\xa0 I’m not determined anything.\\xa0 The facts are going to determine what I do.\\xa0 But we do want to get the country open.\\xa0 So important.\\n\\nSo I’ll have a task force.\\xa0 I’ll have a council.\\xa0 It’s going to be announced on Tuesday with names that you have a lot of respect for, a lot of great names.\\xa0 Different businesses, different people.\\xa0 Top —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Bipartisan?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Bipartisan?\\xa0 I didn’t even ask.\\xa0 I mean, honestly, I think it’s bipartisan.\\xa0 The one thing I didn’t ask, “Are you Republican or a Democrat?”\\xa0 Hard to believe, but I didn’t ask.\\xa0 So it would be.\\xa0 And I want their views on what they think.\\n\\nAlso, very important, different parts of the country.\\xa0 Because if you go to the Midwest, it’s different than perhaps the East Coast or the West Coast.\\xa0 Now, the West Coast, those numbers are, really, pretty amazing on the West Coast.\\xa0 It’s very interesting.\\n\\nSo we’re going to be announcing that in a very short while.\\xa0 Probably Tuesday.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Government officials in Latin American and in Caribbean nations — Bahamas, Cayman Islands — have been saying that U.S. authorities are blocking the shipment of PPE in certain cases.\\xa0 And I’m wondering if you could speak to that, as (inaudible).\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, what we’re doing — we have a tremendous force out there — a naval force — and we’re blocking the shipment of drugs.\\xa0 So maybe what they’re doing is stopping ships that they want to look.\\xa0 We’re not blocking.\\xa0 What we’re doing is we’re making sure — we don’t want drugs in our country.\\xa0 And especially with the over 160 miles of wall — it’s getting very hard to get through the border.\\xa0 They used to drive right through the border like they owned it, and in a certain way, they did.\\xa0 They could drive right — they had human trafficking.\\xa0 They had — all of a sudden, they have a powerful wall up, and they’re not driving through that wall.\\xa0 That wall is tough and it’s also loaded up with equipment — cameras and sensors and everything you can think of.\\xa0\\xa0On top of that, we have drones flying back and forth over it.\\xa0 So — so it’s in very — a very powerful — it’s a very powerful barrier between Mexico and the United States.\\n\\nA lot of people though — what they’re doing now is they’re trying to come in through the waterways, whether it’s the Gulf or the ocean itself.\\xa0 And what we’re doing is we’re being very tough.\\xa0 And we’re being tough because of drugs and also human trafficking.\\n\\nAnd remember, the human trafficking is mostly females.\\xa0 It’s mostly females.\\xa0 It’s horrible.\\xa0 And what we’re seeing is horrible.\\xa0\\xa0But you have a big — we have a human trafficking — human trafficking problem worldwide, the likes of which — you know, you think of it as an ancient thing.\\xa0 It’s not ancient.\\xa0 It’s bigger now than it’s ever been before, over the last 10 years, because of the Internet.\\xa0 The Internet made human trafficking to the extent that it is now, which is massive.\\xa0 The Internate [sic] — the Internet made it so big.\\n\\nSo, we are — we have a big naval force that’s stopping.\\xa0\\xa0So maybe when you mention that, maybe their ships are getting caught.\\xa0 But we are — we’re stopping a lot of ships, and we’re finding a lot of drugs.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 On the additional money for small —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I meant you, but that’s okay.\\xa0 Go head.\\xa0 We’ll do this.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m sorry.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On the additional money for small business, apparently Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is speaking with the Democrats in Congress.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you allowing him to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You’re talking about the new —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, on the new $250 billion.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, 250.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you willing to give into Democratic demands for, you know, additional money for hospitals, states, and cities in that interim round of money?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’d rather have that be in phase four.\\xa0 I don’t deny it; I think it’s fine.\\xa0 But I think it should be in phase four.\\xa0 And I think we should have infrastructure, and I think we should have a payroll tax moratorium, because that’s something that, over a period of time, the workers get, you know, sort of semi-immediately.\\xa0 It’s over that period of time.\\xa0 It starts immediately, but it’s over a period of time.\\n\\nI mean, there are a lot of people — I’m one of them — that would have liked to have seen the payroll tax cut as a permanent cut.\\xa0 But we should do the double-edged — meaning, business-employee payroll tax cut.\\xa0 So we’re talking about that.\\n\\nAnd I’m certainly okay with helping the states and helping the hospitals.\\xa0 I just think — because, look, the hospitals need help; you see what they’ve gone through.\\xa0 And the states need help.\\xa0 Some states in particular need help.\\xa0 They need big help.\\xa0 I’m willing to look at that very strongly.\\xa0 But I like looking at it in phase four.\\n\\nThe 251 is actually — the plan is working out well.\\xa0 The banks are getting started with the distribution.\\xa0 They’ve taken hund- — thousands and thousands of applications.\\xa0 The numbers aren’t even believable, the number of applications.\\xa0 They’re swamped.\\xa0 But Bank of America and Wells Fargo, and, I guess,\\nCiti — Citibank is just now kicking in.\\n\\nAnd also what nobody is talking about, the commercial banks — the community banks.\\xa0 Everyone is talking commercial banks.\\xa0 The community banks are doing tremendous volumes.\\xa0 And they’re probably doing them faster, from what I understand.\\xa0 I hear the community banks, frankly, are the easiest ones in terms of getting the money out.\\n\\nSo the money is getting out.\\xa0 The applications are far beyond what we ever anticipated.\\xa0 And that’s what we’re — that’s why we’re going.\\xa0 Because this is money that goes, essentially, to the workers.\\xa0 We want the businesses to hold on to their workers, because once they lose the workers, they’re never opening again.\\xa0 It’s not going to happen.\\n\\nOkay, in the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\xa0 Gordon Lubold from the Wall Street Journal.\\xa0 I wondered if you could expand a little bit on your — like the form that Mexico would take the reimbursements.\\xa0 Like, what form would that take?\\xa0 Do you essentially to the tab for the wall that you mentioned?\\xa0 And I have a second question, if I may.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, there’s no real cost because we’re agreeing to produce a little bit less.\\xa0 So, number one, it’s staying in the ground.\\xa0 You have it.\\xa0 You have it for another day.\\xa0 It’s actually cheaper than storing it, where you take it out and you deliver it to a massive well, like the Strategic Reserves — our National Strategic Reserves where it has to be brought there.\\xa0\\xa0And that’s, you know, an expensive process in itself.\\n\\nBut oil is getting to a point where, I mean, there are some areas — some people would say the water is more valuable than the oil.\\xa0 You never thought you’re going to see that.\\xa0 You never thought having covered — I know you cover it — you never thought you’d be seeing oil at $20 a barrel, but how about $10 a barrel?\\xa0 That, you never thought you’d see.\\n\\nSo we are looking at it very strongly.\\xa0 There is no real cost.\\xa0 I was helping Mex- — I want to help Mexico out.\\xa0 We have a great relationship with Mexico, a great relationship with the President.\\xa0 I really like him a lot.\\xa0 He’s been terrific to us on the border because he stopped — he stopped — you don’t see the caravans coming up anymore.\\xa0 You don’t see all the problems.\\xa0 When I took office, it was unbelievable what was going on.\\n\\nAnd they are really — they have been helping us a lot, and we’ve been helping them a lot.\\xa0 You know, they make product for us, they sell it to us, and it’s fine.\\xa0 It’s a good relationship.\\xa0 It’s — and sometimes it’s a great relationship.\\n\\nSo, he could not have done any more than that.\\xa0 And I think there was political reasons for that — for him — that other — other nations don’t have.\\xa0 They don’t have that.\\xa0 You know, the nations that we’re talking about — the 22 other nations that we’re talking about — they just don’t have that problem.\\n\\nSo, it doesn’t cost us anything, and yet it’s very valuable.\\xa0 We will be reimbursed in the future — maybe in the near future, maybe in the more distant future.\\xa0 But we’ll be reimbursed by Mexico in a certain way, and it’ll be fine.\\xa0 But we get Mexico over the hump.\\n\\nNow with all of that being said, that doesn’t mean the deal is going to happen anyway, because they still have a lot of different states.\\xa0 But this was one of the stumbling blocks.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If I may, China and some other countries that have been particularly active — seen as maybe taking advantage of the U.S. during this process, during this period.\\xa0 China particularly acted in the South China Sea.\\xa0 Got a carrier down, obviously.\\xa0 What’s your message to some of these adversaries and competitors?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, look, the way I view it is this: China has taken advantage of the United States for 30 years.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 I mentioned the World Trade Organization.\\xa0 China has taken advantage of us through that and using rules that are unfair to the United States.\\xa0 And they should have never been allowed — this should have never been allowed to happen.\\n\\nWhen China joined and was allowed to join under those circumstances — the World Trade Organization — that was a very bad day for the United States because they had rules and regulations that were far different and far easier than our rules and regulations.\\xa0 Plus, they took advantage of them down to the last — and you know China and you studied China and you know what I mean.\\xa0 They took advantage of them like very few people would even think to take advantage of them.\\n\\nAnd again, they are considered — right? — a developing nation.\\xa0 We are not considered a developing nation.\\xa0 They’ve given advantages.\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nFor many years, China has ripped off the United States.\\xa0 And then I came along.\\xa0 And right now, as you know, China is paying 25 percent, and we’ve taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China.\\xa0 And I know a lot of the people kept saying, “Oh, no.\\xa0 We’re paying.”\\xa0 Well, we’re not paying.\\xa0 You know, countries are different.\\xa0 Not every country is China.\\xa0 But China would devalue their currency, and they’d also pour out money.\\xa0 And they, essentially, were paying most of those tariffs, not us.\\n\\nAnd, as you know, we’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars.\\xa0 They targeted our farmers.\\xa0 But we took in so much money that I was able to give back.\\xa0 One year it was $12 billion.\\xa0 One year was $16 billion.\\xa0 I was able to give back our farmers the money that they were targeted — hurt.\\n\\nChina bought $12 billion and bought $16 billion — one year, 12; one year, 16.\\xa0 I was able to give them back the 12, and then give them back the 16 — the farmers.\\xa0 And they weren’t targeted, and they’re all in business.\\xa0 Now we’re doing it because they got targeted in a different way.\\n\\nNow, I’m going to be very interested to see.\\xa0 So we signed a deal with China.\\xa0 And under that deal, they’re supposed to buy substantially in excess of $200 billion from us.\\xa0 That’s not only farm product, it’s manufacturing product, it’s lots of different things.\\xa0 They’re going to buy a lot.\\xa0 I just want to see if they live up to that deal.\\n\\nI know President Xi.\\xa0 I would say he would live up to the deal.\\xa0 But remember this: I never took off the tariff.\\xa0 It’s still 25 percent.\\xa0 That’s a big — 25 percent of $250 billion dollars.\\n\\nSo, for the first time — and you saw also — now again, I’m going before the virus hit.\\xa0 Because that’s sort of like — that’s like, “Let’s start all over again.”\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 I can’t tell you that yet, because that chapter hasn’t been written yet.\\xa0 But go up a few weeks ago, the deficit with the United States and China was coming way down.\\xa0 Nobody has seen that.\\xa0 Nobody has ever seen that before.\\xa0 But the deficit has come way down.\\n\\nSo, now we start a new chapter.\\xa0 And I can only tell you, if a smart person is standing where I’m standing, we’re going to do very well with China.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nAnd I think it’s — I have to also say this: I think our relationship, and having the relationship I have with China is a good thing.\\xa0 But for the first time, we’re benefiting instead of being the sucker that could — you know, that got taken advantage of for years.\\xa0 Nobody.\\n\\nYou know, I said to China, “How did this ever happen?”\\xa0 I got to know them very well.\\xa0 I said to them — representatives of China at the top level, you know who I’m talking about — I say, “How did this ever happen?”\\xa0 They looked at me and they said, “But nobody ever called us.”\\xa0 We didn’t have a deal.\\xa0 It’s not like we had a bad deal.\\xa0 We had worse: We didn’t have any deal at all, so they just took advantage.\\n\\nThink of it: $500-billion-a-year deficit.\\xa0 Not — $500 million is a lot of money, right?\\xa0 It’s not — everyone thinks I’ve made a mistake when I say “$500 trillion.”\\xa0 “No, you mean $500 million.”\\xa0 “No, I said 500-billion-dollar-a-year deficit with China for a long time.”\\xa0 But it was 200.\\xa0 It was 300.\\xa0 It was 400.\\xa0 It was 500 — 556 billion, 507.\\xa0 Five-hundred-billion-dollars-plus-a-year deficit with China.\\xa0 Now I’m charging them tariffs.\\n\\nAnd, you know, it’s very interesting.\\xa0 A lot of people that don’t want to do that — they all agreed because China has taken advantage of this country like nobody has ever taken.\\xa0 We have built China with the money we gave them.\\n\\nNow, I give them a lot of credit.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 I give them a lot of credit.\\xa0 They did it.\\xa0 But you know what?\\xa0 We made it a hell of a lot easier.\\xa0 We gave them a fortune.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 How about you in the back?\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 I’m Deborah Saunders with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, and I’m here today as the print reporter — the print pooler.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, I’d like to ask you a question, and then ask a question from one of the reporters who couldn’t be here because of social distancing.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 A little louder, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 I was wondering if you have been tested for antibodies?\\xa0 If you’ve taken the antibody test.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Have I been tested for antibodies?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Not that I know of.\\xa0 I’ve had some tests.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Has anybody else here been tested?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No?\\xa0 They tell me “no.”\\xa0 I’ll accept it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Has anybody else on the task force been tested for antibodies?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 We don’t have a test yet.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You don’t have a test?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We don’t have a test yet.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’ll come out.\\xa0 They’ve just developed those tests.\\xa0 They’re sort of new.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Good to know.\\xa0 So, this question is from Andrew Feinberg with Newsweek.\\xa0 A significant amount of federal aid was made available to Boeing in the recently signed CARES Act relief package.\\xa0 But according to sources, Boeing executives are still planning a round of layoffs.\\xa0 So, should Boeing or any company that accepts federal aid to stay in business during this pandemic be penalized for laying off workers after doing so?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Well, the aid hasn’t been given yet.\\xa0 But they will be asking, in my opinion.\\xa0 They haven’t even asked yet.\\xa0 Boeing has not asked for aid yet.\\xa0 But I think they probably will.\\n\\nNow, at the same time, they do have to run a company.\\xa0 You know, this isn’t a great time to sell airplanes.\\xa0 Let’s not kid ourselves, okay?\\xa0 If you’re a businessperson.\\xa0 Boeing makes airplanes.\\xa0 They had a big problem with one, but they make the greatest airplanes.\\xa0 They make the best airplanes in the world.\\xa0 They had the problem with one.\\xa0 They got it too complex.\\xa0 It becomes so complex you have to be number one in your class at MIT to be able to fly it.\\xa0 It’s a mistake.\\xa0 Every two years, they want to make it more and more.\\n\\nI mean, they had great success with the 737 — the Boeing 737.\\xa0 Then, all of a sudden, they do the Max.\\xa0 And they say, “Let’s make it more complicated.\\xa0 Let’s put on different engines.\\xa0 Let’s do this.\\xa0 Let’s do that.”\\xa0 It was not exactly a good decision.\\xa0 A bad decision.\\xa0 Very, bad — a horrible decision.\\xa0 Number one, human lives.\\xa0 And number two, horrible what’s happened to the company.\\n\\nHere’s a company — from a business standpoint, it was like probably the greatest company in the world, in my opinion.\\xa0 I think it amounts to 1 percent of GDP.\\xa0 Some people say it’s a half.\\xa0 I think it’s 1.\\xa0 But here’s one of the greatest companies anyway in the world.\\xa0 Maybe, the greatest.\\xa0 And boom.\\n\\nNow, on top of what happened there with the two planes — and they say they have that fixed.\\xa0 That’s good.\\xa0 They say they have it fixed undisputably.\\xa0 In fact, somebody said — they gave me something — I said, “You should say it that way.”\\xa0 They said, “Sir, this is now the safest airplane in the air.”\\xa0 I said — “That’s what you should say.\\xa0 That’s a very good statement: It’s the safest airplane in the air.\\xa0 That’s a very good statement.\\xa0 You should use it.”\\xa0 I said, “By the way, are you changing the name?\\xa0 But whether you do or not, you should use that.”\\xa0 But he said that.\\xa0 A Boeing person said to me, “It’s the safest airplane in the air.”\\xa0 That’s a great thing.\\n\\nBut we know they’re going to need help.\\xa0 Now, does that mean they’re going to need help, and they should keep people that they absolutely don’t need?\\xa0 That business is a very cyclical business, like many businesses, frankly.\\xa0 So that determination hasn’t been made.\\xa0 They have not spoken to us, yet.\\xa0 I think they will be.\\xa0 Maybe they won’t need help.\\xa0 That’ll be great.\\n\\nLook, Boeing made so much money — who would’ve — who would’ve thought they could have made all of those planes that are parked all over the place?\\xa0 In many cases, I guess payment is not made.\\xa0 But who would have thought they could do that and they’re still a solvent company, okay?\\xa0 I mean, what a tragic thing — happened in numerous ways, but also economically.\\n\\nSo, when they see us, making sure that Boeing is strong again is very, very powerful and very important.\\xa0 And we’ll do whatever is necessary to do.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 A quick one and then a longer one.\\xa0 First of all, have you had insurance —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Should we keep this going, everybody?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You’re the President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Jim wants to leave.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 Keep it going for a while, yes?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you sure?\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 If we have time, if you want.\\xa0 Should I — you’re not going to criticize me that the conference was too long?\\n\\nYou know, if I leave short — yesterday, I left short.\\xa0 “It was too short.”\\xa0 If stay too long, they say, “It was too long.” Someday, we’re going to get it just right.\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Should we continue?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What do you make of the Republicans who say that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Should we continue?\\xa0 Yes?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, at least answer my question —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Let’s at least do your question.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have you had a chance to speak to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s not a bad point.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have you had a chance yet to speak to Boris Johnson since he came back from intensive care?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I have not.\\xa0 No.\\xa0 I have a call, just to wish him well to his — to his group.\\xa0 No, I don’t want to be calling him now.\\xa0 I want him to get better.\\n\\nHe’s a great guy.\\xa0 He’s become a friend of mine — a real friend of mine.\\xa0 You know, he has a great feeling for our country.\\xa0 For — obviously, for his country.\\xa0 He loves it.\\xa0 He’s — he’s a tremendous guy.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And a slightly more complicated one.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He’s become — I think, he’s probably, right now — he was very high to start.\\xa0 I think he might be 100 percent popularity right now.\\xa0 I think he’s — you know, when they talk about approval polls, right?\\xa0 You ever hear that term?\\xa0 I’m sure you never heard that.\\xa0 I hear it all the time.\\xa0 His approval rating must be about 300 percent.\\n\\nBut he’s a — he’s a great guy.\\xa0 He was a great guy before and I think people see what he’s been through.\\xa0 What he has been through is incredible.\\xa0 And they say a “big turn.”\\xa0 So let’s see what happens.\\xa0 Let’s hope.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And, if I may, where do you see the use of something like immunity certificates or documents or passports, when we get to anti-body testing?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Something like — excuse me?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Immunity certificates — once we get to anti-body testing, whether this would be a useful way —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I see a lot of — yeah.\\xa0 I see a lot of different things.\\xa0 We’re going — we have to be very careful for who comes into the country.\\xa0 Look, my opposition party wants to have open borders.\\xa0 This is a case where I’m very glad that my position is: I don’t want open borders.\\xa0 I want very strong borders.\\xa0 That includes not only on the southern border — our southern border with Mexico, and you could also say our northern border with Canada — but we want to have strong borders.\\n\\nAnd, I think, this is maybe one of the learning points.\\xa0 We learned something about borders.\\xa0 We need borders.\\xa0 A country needs borders to be a great country.\\xa0 And this is, I think, this is a great point.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 Do you have something else?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 I wasn’t just thinking about for borders.\\xa0 I just thought for ordinary Americans who are currently stuck at home.\\xa0 If they’re tested for antibodies, it turns out they’ve had the disease and therefore shouldn’t be infected again — some sort of documentation that would allow them to go back to work safely.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You mean, once they get better?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, or people who might not (inaudible).\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 So, they have the disease and they’re better and they have the immunity now.\\xa0 They have — supposedly, according to what I am hearing, it could be for a long period.\\xa0 It could be for a lifetime.\\xa0 It could also be for a for a year or two, I’m hearing, Tony.\\n\\nSo nobody has told me yet if it’s for a year, if it’s for two years, or if it’s for a lifetime.\\xa0 Like chickenpox — they say if you have chickenpox, you have immunity, they say, for a lifetime.\\xa0 I hope that’s true.\\n\\nBut — but nobody has actually told me with certainty, maybe because they don’t know yet —\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 We don’t know yet.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You don’t know yet.\\xa0 Because it’s new.\\xa0 You know, this came upon us.\\xa0 Nobody knew.\\xa0 We just — we’re just — they do know you have it for a period of time and it’s strong for a period of time.\\xa0 They don’t know — and that’s, hence the antibodies that we’re making.\\n\\nI saw somebody who was really sick, and he got better — a young person, a relatively young person — 35 and physically fit, you know.\\xa0 And he — he got better.\\xa0 He made it.\\xa0 Barely, but he made it.\\xa0 His first thing that he did when he was better is, “I want to give — I want to give whatever I can give to help other people because nobody should go through it.”\\xa0 It’s a tough — it’s a tough thing.\\n\\nSo we don’t know yet how long — if you’d like to add anything to that.\\xa0 But we don’t know yet.\\xa0 Is it a year?\\xa0 It will be a year.\\xa0 But is it more than a year?\\xa0 And only time is going to tell.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I just ask one more question?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Try one more.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Will you have governors, mayors, members of Congress on the Open the Country Council that you talked about a minute ago?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I think so.\\xa0 I think we’re going to put some governors.\\xa0 I’ve gained great respect for governors, both Republican and Democrat.\\xa0 I’ve actually become friends with some of the Democrat governors that I wouldn’t have really had the privilege of getting to know.\\n\\nAnd Governor Murphy of New Jersey is a very liberal guy.\\xa0 I’m not.\\xa0 But we’ve had a great relationship.\\xa0 John Bel, as you know — I call him “John Bel” — John Bel Edwards.\\xa0 People call him “John Bel.”\\xa0 It’s sort of a cool name — from Louisiana.\\xa0 I have a very good relationship with him.\\n\\nGavin Newsom.\\xa0 Honestly, I think we’ve fight on every — hey, we’re fighting right now.\\xa0 I want automobiles to be made cheaper and safer and stronger.\\xa0 And — but you save three, four thousand dollars per automobile.\\xa0 And environmentally equal, or better, maybe.\\xa0 And we’re fighting on that.\\xa0 We’re fighting a lot of different things.\\xa0 We fight on the border.\\xa0 He wants open borders.\\xa0 I want — I want people to come into our country legally.\\xa0 But I’ve gotten very friendly with Gavin Newsom.\\xa0 He’s done a very good job here.\\n\\nI think I’ve gotten very friendly.\\xa0 I mean, he’s been, I think, sort of a friend of mine for a long time.\\xa0 Don’t get to see him much.\\xa0 But Governor Cuomo of New York — we talk all the time.\\xa0 I told you, I spoke to him literally the last call, just before walking in here.\\n\\nI’ve gotten to — I’ve really developed a lot of good friendships with the governors and, including governors of (inaudible.)\\xa0 I think — Mike DeWine, Republican, but I think he’s done a great job in Ohio.\\n\\nSo, yeah, I want to put on both parties.\\xa0 I want to have some governors.\\xa0 I’m not going to have all of the governors, but I’d like to put some representative governors on the council.\\xa0 Yes, I would like to do that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And have you asked any to serve yet?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I have.\\xa0 I’ve asked a couple of them.\\xa0 They’ve all said yes.\\xa0 So far, everyone said yes.\\xa0 I think everybody would like to be on that council.\\xa0 That’s a very important council.\\n\\nGo ahead, in the back.\\xa0 You haven’t gone yet.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Two questions, if I may.\\xa0 Do you have a message to those pastors who are still planning to have Easter services, defying the Public Health’s guidelines?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You’re going to have to say it louder.\\xa0 To those what?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To those pastors who are still planning to have Easter services in person.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Pastors who are defying —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, the pastors.\\xa0 I didn’t understand your word.\\xa0 Okay, you have a very nice voice but it’s a little bit low, and you’re far back.\\n\\nI’ve had talks with the pastors, and most of the pastors agree — and this is a very complex subject, let’s face it, you know, for the obvious reasons.\\xa0 I don’t have to go into it.\\xa0 And most of the pastors agree that they are better off doing what they’re doing, which is distancing.\\xa0 They feel that, “Let’s get this over with,” and they want to get back to church so badly.\\n\\nI mean, can you imagine?\\xa0 We have Easter Sunday and I’m going to be watching Pastor Robert Jeffress, who’s been a great guy, that I tell you.\\xa0 He’s been a great guy, and I’m going to be watching on a laptop.\\xa0 Now, a laptop is not the same as being in his church or being in another church.\\xa0 It’s not, no matter what you say.\\xa0 You know, we can say, “Oh, isn’t it wonderful?”\\n\\nBut I’ve done this for three weeks, and they’ve had tremendous — I let people know who it is.\\xa0 They’ve had the biggest audiences they’ve ever had.\\xa0 They have millions of people now watching, and people are really liking what they’re hearing.\\n\\nSo I’m going to be with, on Easter, Pastor — I don’t even know if he knows it yet, but he will soon.\\xa0 I think he will in about two minutes.\\xa0 Pastor Robert Jeffress.\\xa0 And he’s a terrific guy, a terrific man.\\xa0 I’ve gotten to know him very well.\\xa0 He’s a man of great compassion.\\xa0 He loves our country.\\xa0 And I’m going to be with him on Easter — meaning I’m going to be with him, watching on a laptop.\\xa0 Doesn’t sound good, but it’s, you know, it’s one of those things — it cannot be church.\\xa0 You know, I’m not going to get into it.\\xa0 It cannot be church.\\n\\nMost pastors and most people of faith — people that we listen to and respect and admire.\\xa0 Franklin Graham is a person I have great respect for.\\xa0 Most people will — and who’s done an incredible job in New York on Central Park, where they put up Samaritan’s Purse.\\xa0 He’s done an incredible job.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Incredible.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The son of the late, great Billy Graham.\\xa0 His family is incredible.\\xa0 He’s incredible.\\xa0 Franklin Graham, the job he’s doing on — I mean, he loves to do it.\\xa0 He has such a passion.\\xa0 And that’s why he’s so good at it.\\xa0 He does it with — with incredible love.\\n\\nAnd he will tell you — we’re all saying, “We’ve got to get our country cured.”\\xa0 I know there are some pastors and ministers and others that want to get together.\\xa0 I would — and I have great respect for them.\\xa0 Two of them I know.\\n\\nBut I would say first heal — I’m a Christian — heal our country.\\xa0 Let’s get healed before we do this.\\xa0 And there’s time to do that.\\xa0 We’ll do it for hopefully the rest of our lives.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 The Mercy and the Comfort seem to be underutilized —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — in Los Angeles and New York.\\xa0 Is there any consideration either to sending the medical units into the cities to — to help —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — the hospitals there or to —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 In the hotspots.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — or to moving the hospital ships?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 So the Mercy and the Comfort were sent when projections were much higher.\\xa0 And I say it — Tony backed it up, Deborah made the statement — they said you’re not going to need these many rooms, but we wanted to be prepared.\\xa0 I mean, you know, we had the ship.\\xa0 They did an incredible job with — the Comfort was supposed to be in maintenance for a period of four weeks and they hadn’t done in three and a half, four days.\\xa0 And it came up.\\xa0 And so we had it there.\\n\\nIf there was a disaster from the standpoint of you needed all of the — now, I’ll tell you, the Javits Center — Andrew will tell you, we were ready to go.\\xa0 It’s incredible, the job they did.\\xa0 But they’re — they’re using less beds.\\xa0 This is a good thing, not a bad thing.\\xa0 They’re using less beds.\\n\\nNow, Javits has been pretty busy over the last couple of days.\\xa0 And the death numbers are horrific.\\xa0 But you go back now and you’re finding they’re going to start to come down very substantially just based on the fact that the bed usage, the number of beds are much, much less.\\xa0 Much, much less.\\n\\nSo the Mercy and the Comfort were there in case they needed them.\\xa0 Los Angeles, where you have the one and New York where you the other, they just don’t — fortunately, we haven’t hit numbers where they would have need, they would have been used.\\xa0 They’re always going to be sort of overflow because they’re on the edges. \\xa0You know, they’re not as convenient as certain places.\\xa0 But the people were ready, willing, and able.\\xa0 They were ready to go.\\xa0 They were going to do a great job.\\n\\nBut fortunately we don’t need — just like we didn’t need as many ventilators.\\xa0 When they were asking in New York for 40,000 ventilators, I had experts — these people, I listened to them — they said you’ll never need that many.\\xa0 And they were right.\\xa0 And New York now has it’s — and I dealt really well Mayor de Blasio.\\xa0 We got him a lot of ventilators.\\xa0 We got Andrew a lot of ventilators.\\xa0 But we never felt you needed the numbers that you were talking about and we were right on that.\\n\\nNow, with all of that being said, we have a lot of ventilators ready to go.\\xa0 We have almost 10,000 in the stockpile.\\xa0 That 10,000 can move rapidly.\\xa0 We can be within 24 hours almost anywhere.\\xa0 And hopefully we’re not going to have to be but it’s just — it’s really — this has been a great military operation.\\xa0 It hasn’t all been military because we’re dealing with great companies.\\xa0 We have companies that are making masks.\\xa0 We’re — and we’re all set up in the masks too.\\n\\nI just told you we have an order coming in soon: 500 million masks.\\xa0 500 million.\\xa0 We have companies — you know the story with GM — or 3M — also GM, but 3M is doing a great job.\\xa0 I spoke to the CEO the other day.\\xa0 We settled it out.\\xa0 We had a dispute with them.\\xa0 And it’s now all settled.\\xa0 And I think they’re trying to show the country something — maybe me, but the country something.\\n\\nSo, we’ve done, you know, I think — and not me.\\xa0 I’m not talking about me.\\xa0 This country, our country, the people that are doing it: Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA, these people sitting right here, people that we have in the back that are watching every word that we’re saying — they’ve done a fantastic job.\\xa0 They really have done a fantastic job.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 I wanted to ask you a question about testing.\\xa0 You’ve mentioned the impossibility of testing the entire American public.\\xa0 So has —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, what do we have —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — the Surgeon General — hold on —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 What do we have?\\xa0 350 million people?\\xa0 You’re going to do $350- —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Three hundred fifty million.\\xa0 That’s not what I’m getting at.\\xa0 What I’m getting at is priorities.\\xa0 And Dr. Birx has mentioned how there have been priorities in certain regional parts of the country.\\xa0 And I wanted to ask you specifically about one industry in particular, and that’s food-processing plants.\\xa0 Is there a priority to get testing at food-processing plants all across the country?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, you’re asking that because of what happened — it’s a fair question, too — what happened in Denver.\\xa0 Because in Denver, I’ve never seen — I said, “What’s going on?”\\xa0 We’re looking at this graph where everything’s looking beautiful and it’s coming down and then you got this one spike.\\xa0 It’s — I said, “What happened to Denver?”\\n\\nAnd many people, very quickly, and they — by the way, they were on it like, so fast, you wouldn’t believe it.\\xa0 They knew every aspect.\\xa0 They had people go and — not only testing, “Who did you see?\\xa0 Where were you?\\xa0 How many people did you meet?\\xa0 Were you out to dinner in somebody else’s home?\\xa0 Where were you?”\\xa0 Where did — where did this number of people come from?\\xa0 How did — they are totally on it.\\n\\nNow, this just happened.\\xa0 I just saw it this morning.\\xa0 I’m looking at everything smooth, going down, topping out.\\xa0 And then you have this one spike in Denver.\\xa0 It’s like, where did this come from?\\n\\nSo we’ll be looking at that.\\xa0 And we don’t want cases like that happening.\\xa0 This was — but this — this is the kind of thing can happen.\\xa0 This is very complex.\\n\\nThis is a very brilliant enemy.\\xa0 You know, it’s a brilliant enemy.\\xa0 They develop drugs like the antibiotics.\\xa0 You see it.\\xa0 Antibiotics used to solve every problem.\\xa0 Now one of the biggest problems the world has is the germ has gotten so brilliant that the antibiotic can’t keep up with it.\\xa0 And they’re constantly trying to come up with a new — people go to a hospital and they catch — they go for a heart operation — that’s no problem, but they end up dying from — from problems.\\xa0 You know the problems I’m talking about.\\xa0 There’s a whole genius to it.\\n\\nWe’re fighting — not only is it hidden, but it’s very smart.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 It’s invisible and it’s hidden, but it’s — it’s very smart.\\xa0 And you see that in a case like a Denver.\\n\\nBut, you know, I think we’re doing well, and they’re on Denver like you wouldn’t believe.\\xa0 I came in this morning; it was a flurry.\\xa0 I said what’s going on?\\xa0 They said, “Denver.”\\xa0 I said, “What happened to Denver?”\\xa0 Because Denver was doing pretty well.\\xa0 And they’ve got that under control.\\xa0 But, yeah, that would be a case where you do some very big testing.\\n\\nPeter.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, we’ve learned that more than 16 million Americans filed for unemployment over the past three weeks.\\xa0 It’s Good Friday.\\xa0 It’s payday.\\xa0 We are seeing troubling, paralyzing lines at food banks around the country.\\xa0 What do you say to those Americans in need right this moment?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Number one, I love them.\\xa0 Number two, we’re working really hard.\\xa0 It wasn’t their fault, what happened.\\xa0 Sometimes they don’t do a good job and they lose their job.\\xa0 That’s one thing.\\xa0 This is a case where we take the strongest economy in the history of the world, which is what we had.\\xa0 More people working in the United States, Peter, than ever before.\\xa0 Almost — I mean, look at the numbers: 160 million people, almost.\\xa0 Just short of 160.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Excuse me.\\n\\nSo, we have the greatest economy we’ve ever had.\\xa0 And, by the way, black unemployment, Hispanic unemployment, Asian unemployment — the best numbers we’ve ever had in virtually every way.\\xa0 And then you get hit like this, and it’s traumatic.\\n\\nPeople that had great jobs, that went out to dinner, and they didn’t have any problems, they’d take their family, they were making good salaries, all of a sudden — you know, you use the term, “cold turkey.”\\xa0 It’s cold turkey.\\xa0 They go from that to having no money and waiting for their checks, which are being processed very rapidly.\\xa0 But they still — they have to go out and look for money.\\n\\nIt’s a terrible thing.\\xa0 All I say is: We love them, we’re working so hard, and they’re going to be back.\\xa0 And I hope they’re going to be back even stronger than before.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Let me ask you about that, if I can, just to follow up then.\\xa0 You chose not to do a national stay-at-home order.\\xa0 Now that you say you want to reopen parts of the economy, what authority do you have to do that?\\xa0 Isn’t that ultimately up to the states to do that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Yeah — no, it’s really — the states can do things if they want.\\xa0 I can override it if I want.\\xa0 But the national stay-at-home — just so you understand, 95 percent of the country is stay-at-home.\\n\\nLike, as an example, I was speaking with the great governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, the other day.\\xa0 He has a stay-at-home.\\xa0 A lot of people didn’t even know it, but he had a stay-at -home.\\xa0 Some people reported Texas wasn’t.\\xa0 He had a very strong — actually, a very strong stay-at-home.\\n\\nNinety-five to ninety-six percent in South Carolina, as you know, has it, which at one point, a week ago, they didn’t have.\\xa0 South Carolina — another great governor — McMaster.\\n\\nNo, 95 percent of the country is covered.\\xa0 Now, the states that aren’t — and again, constitutionally, from a federalist standpoint, if I thought there was a problem, if I saw a state with a problem, I would absolutely demand it.\\xa0 But they’re doing great.\\xa0 And the states that aren’t are states that have not had a big problem.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What authority do you have to reopen right now?\\xa0 The same way that it’s up to the states to shut it down, it’s up to them to reopen.\\xa0 What authority do you have?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I have — I have great authority if I want to use it.\\xa0 I would rather have the states use it.\\xa0 I would rather —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What does that look like?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And this is so shocking for me.\\xa0 A lot of people are saying, “Wow, he’s really very reasoned, isn’t he?”\\xa0 A lot of people are shocked.\\xa0 They think I do a — I have absolute authority to use it. \\xa0But, so far, our relationship with governors and the job they’re doing, I haven’t had to do it.\\xa0 Would I do it if I saw a state that was out of control and they didn’t have the stay-at-home policy?\\xa0 I would do it in a heartbeat.\\n\\nJeff.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, there’s obviously a lot of interest in how you’re going to make that decision.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s a very big decision.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What metrics —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know that I’ve had a bigger decision than that, when you think.\\xa0 Right?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I would think —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I mean, think of that decision.\\xa0 Somebody said, “It’s totally up to the President.”\\xa0 I saw it this morning.\\xa0 It’s totally up — and it is.\\xa0 I don’t know that I’ve had a bigger decision.\\n\\nBut I’m going to surround myself with the greatest minds.\\xa0 Not only the greatest minds, but the greatest minds in numerous different businesses, including the business of politics and reason.\\xa0 And we’re going to make a decision, and hopefully it’s going to be the right decision.\\n\\nI will say this: I want to get it open as soon as we can.\\xa0 We have to get our country open, Jeff.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can you say, sir, what metrics you will use to make that decision?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The metrics right here.\\xa0 (Points to head.)\\xa0 That’s my metrics.\\xa0 That’s all I can do.\\xa0 I can listen to 35 people.\\xa0 At the end, I got to make a decision.\\xa0 And I didn’t think of it until yesterday.\\xa0 I said, “You know, this is a big decision.”\\xa0 But I want to be guided.\\xa0 I’m going to be guided by them.\\xa0 I’m going to be guided by our Vice President.\\xa0 I’m going to make a decision based on a lot of different opinions.\\xa0 Some will maybe disagree, and some I’d love to see it where they don’t disagree.\\n\\nWill there be risks?\\xa0 There’s always going to be a risk that something can flare up.\\xa0 There’s always going to — look, look at what’s happening where countries are trying to get open and there’s a flare-up and they’ll go.\\xa0 But I’d like the flare-up to be very localized so that we can control it from a local standpoint without having to close.\\n\\nIt’s — it’s — there’s always a risk.\\xa0 This is a — this is genius that we’re fighting.\\xa0 You know, we’re fighting this hidden enemy, which is genius.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 It’s genius, the way it’s attacked so many countries at so many different angles.\\xa0 And — I mean, you take a look at what’s going on.\\n\\nAnd the greatest doctors in the world — I think they’re close, by the way, but they haven’t figured it out yet.\\xa0 Look what it’s done to some people.\\xa0 I mean, some people it’s grabbed, and it’s a — it’s a horrible — it’s a horrible way to go, if you want to know the truth.\\xa0 It’s a horrible — and then other people, it hardly has an impact on.\\xa0 We talked about it; it’s the sniffles.\\xa0 It’s less.\\xa0 They don’t even know they had anything.\\n\\nAnd some people — I looked at New York this morning, and I look at what’s happening and the amount of people that are dying and dying — violently dying.\\xa0 It’s — it’s a — it’s a very tough adversary.\\xa0 But we’re going to win, and we’re going to win it — we’re going to win it very decisively.\\n\\nI’m going to have to make a decision, and I only hope to God that it’s the right decision.\\xa0 But I would say, without question, it’s the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A quick follow-up for the doctors, if I may, for Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx.\\xa0 The models, as I understand them, are based on social distancing continuing through May.\\xa0 Is that correct?\\xa0 And if you were to open the economy on May 1st or sometime during that month, would that impact the models in terms of the deaths that you expect?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Want to answer that?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 We’re taking turns today?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Good.\\xa0 That’s good.\\n\\nSo the model — the IHME model — does state that it’s through May.\\xa0 Every — we’ve had these model discussions, haven’t we, for weeks now?\\xa0 So the models are informed by the data, and you can see how much that model has shifted on the amazing work of the American people.\\xa0 So I think that’s what we’re evaluating right now.\\n\\nRemember when — when I talked yesterday — I’ve been in public health a long time.\\xa0 I have never — except for Ebola, where we worked very closely with the communities about specific issues — we’ve never taken a country-wide or a global-wide approach to mitigation.\\xa0 This is unprecedented.\\n\\nI will tell you there is nothing in the literature about specifically what to expect, and I think that’s why the models continue to modify themselves based on what actually has happened with social distancing and handwashing and all of the pieces that the American people are doing — the decreasing, the closing of the bars, the closing of the restaurants, no communal eating.\\xa0 That was thought to be a very big issue in many of the other cultures that went through this virus.\\n\\nSo the models continue to evolve based on the impact.\\xa0 And so, therefore, it makes it very difficult to interpret each component of social distancing and which ones are absolutely critical.\\n\\nNow, there’s a way to do that in multivariate analysis, potentially.\\xa0 Now, I want to — I want everyone to understand, there are states that are testing.\\xa0 There are states that are doing contact tracing.\\xa0 So, I mean, it’s — I think sometimes we get — you know, we look at what New York is doing and Detroit, and we forget that there’s a Utah and New Mexico and North and South Dakota and a whole series of states that have been doing testing and contact tracing, and have been testing at rates higher than that per capita rate that we all have discussed.\\n\\nSo we’re looking at that: What did they do?\\xa0 Where are the most vulnerabilities?\\xa0 Where are the outbreaks most likely to occur?\\xa0 And that’s why I’ve been talking about nursing homes, because we do believe that there’s a relationship between age and seriousness of disease.\\xa0 Not to say that there can’t be young people with serious disease, but proportionally, it’s a smaller piece with serious disease.\\n\\nAnd so when you have that kind of spectrum where the older and the more complicated, the higher the severity, you get the impression that there may be more asymptomatic in younger age groups.\\xa0 And that’s where the antibody test comes in.\\n\\nSo when you put all these pieces together, you’re trying to understand where is — where would be the first signals.\\xa0 So we have surveillance out there right now with the CDC’s influenza-like illness.\\xa0 I hope you’re all tracking that.\\xa0 It is showing these small changes.\\xa0 I think we can believe in that as a surveillance tool, married with their syndromic piece, giving us the insight about where to test and then where to proactively test in the nursing homes and other vulnerable groups.\\xa0 Because that has been the signal in a series of the states that have very, very low prevalence and incidence of disease.\\xa0 So that’s the kind of factors we’re putting altogether to really define the best way forward.\\n\\nAnd we have superb roadmaps.\\xa0 I hope you all have seen them.\\xa0 There’s been about six different roadmaps to opening that people have put online.\\xa0 And again, there’s no literature that you can cite and said, “Well, we did this 20 years ago and what really worked.”\\xa0 There’s — there isn’t that.\\xa0 There’s brilliant public health people giving us their insights.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I guess the core of the question is, because those are the models you’ve been using, if you do go with opening up — starting to open up the economy again on May 1st,\\xa0doesn’t that lead to more deaths?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Well, look at how much it changed with mitigation.\\xa0 And now we’re looking at those state by state.\\xa0 And there’s some states in there that are still in contact tracing.\\xa0 So we’re looking at the impact of that model and what that model predicted, based on the type of contact tracing — less mitigation; more contact tracing.\\n\\nAre we — are you getting what I’m talking about?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No — (inaudible.)\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Okay, so there are states that didn’t stay-at- home orders, but were doing contact tracing from outbreaks.\\xa0 So we’re looking at them and how they have done, and we’re looking at certainly what’s happened in the big metro areas.\\xa0 And we’re integrating all of that data together to make a plan going forward.\\n\\nSo I can’t tell you — because look at how much the model has changed in just a week.\\xa0 Remember, just a week ago it was 80,000.\\xa0 Now it’s 60,000.\\xa0 So — and the curves — I’m sure you’re all watching it — the curves are getting much broader confidence intervals.\\n\\nThere is still the dotted line, but the confidence intervals around the dotted line are getting bigger.\\xa0 When you see that, you know the model has a bit of instability, and so that’s why Tony and I base a lot of our decision and discussion on cases and what physically is happening in that county, in that state, at the same time not ignoring the models but integrating the models as one piece of our thought process.\\n\\nDo you want to come up here and say what you think about models?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Birx, can you update us on that Abbott Lab test?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I just want to say that, you know, you talked about, “Couldn’t it lead to death,” meaning, if you open up, it could lead to death.\\xa0 And you’re right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But you know what?\\xa0 Staying at home leads to death also.\\xa0 And it’s very traumatic for this country.\\xa0 But staying at home — if you look at numbers — that leads to a different kind of death, perhaps, but it leads to death also.\\xa0 So it’s a very big decision.\\xa0 As I say, it’s the biggest decision I’ll ever make.\\n\\nAll right, we’ll do a couple of more and we’ll go.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Before you came out here, you said one of the last people that you talked to was Governor Cuomo.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And at his news conference today, he said that he was asking you to use the Defense Production Act to require companies to make more tests, to streamline testing.\\xa0 Is that something that you would consider?\\xa0 Because you’ve considered it with ventilators and masks.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, you know, the other side seems to keep using that.\\xa0 And I have used it.\\xa0 You know, I’ve enacted it, you do know.\\xa0 And I’ve used it — some people thought viciously.\\xa0 Just ask a couple of companies.\\xa0 If you want, you can just look up the names.\\n\\nAnd I’m surprised that he would have said that.\\xa0 We actually have great tests.\\xa0 We have others under development.\\xa0 You don’t need full testing, as the doctors have been talking about ad nauseam.\\n\\nSo I would be surprised that he would have said that, meaning it that way.\\xa0 If he — if he did, I’d have a much different type answer.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You all didn’t talk about it over the phone?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We talked about testing, yeah.\\xa0 We did talk about testing.\\xa0 And one of the things I did was I put the two doctors in charge of that call.\\xa0 I said, “You know what, Andrew?\\xa0 I have two very talented people standing here.\\xa0 We’re getting ready to go on.\\xa0 Let me put them and let me have them talk to you.”\\xa0 And they talked to him, really, at length.\\xa0 And I think by the time they finished, he understood what he was — what we were saying.\\xa0 He understood it very clearly.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 One more question, please.\\xa0 You’ve talked a lot this week about holding the World Health Organization responsible —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — for its response to the coronavirus.\\xa0 I’m curious if you’ve given any more thought to holding China financially responsible for the part that it played and —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I understand.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — the economic toll that it’s taking on the American people.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I understand the question very well.\\xa0 Look, nobody has done to China, or treated China as strongly as I have.\\xa0 I use the word “strongly.”\\xa0 As you know — you’ve reported on it — billions and billions of dollars is flowing into our Treasury, because of what I’ve done with China.\\n\\nI think it’s a very sad thing that happened.\\xa0 And I think if people knew, including the World Health Organization — and I do believe they knew, but they didn’t want to tell the world.\\xa0 And we’re going to get to the bottom of it.\\xa0 And we’ll have reports on all of this.\\xa0 And we are — we are not happy about it, but I wanted to leave the World Health for later.\\n\\nAnd I can tell you that we’re constantly in touch with China.\\xa0 We’re talking to China.\\xa0 And we’ve expressed how we felt.\\xa0 We’re not happy about it.\\xa0 We’re not happy about it at all, Kristen.\\n\\nOkay, one or two more.\\xa0 Yeah, Jim.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, we hear from a lot of people who see these briefings as sort of happy-talk briefings.\\xa0 And —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No happy talk today.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — you and some of the officials paint a rosy picture of what is happening around the country.\\xa0 If you look at some of these questions: “Do we have enough masks?”\\xa0 “No.”\\xa0 “Do we have enough tests?”\\xa0 No.”\\xa0 “Do we have enough PPE?”\\xa0 “No.”\\xa0 “Do we have enough” —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Why would you “no”?\\xa0 Look, the answer is “yes.”\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — “medical equipment?”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think the answer is yes.\\xa0 I think the answer is yes.\\xa0 Who — who said no to that?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I — I’m saying this is what —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no, you’re saying no, but who said no?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 We hear — we hear from —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But you asked, “Do we have enough masks?”\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 We hear from the doctors.\\xa0 We hear from health experts.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, you didn’t say that.\\xa0 You said, “Do we have enough masks?”\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Does the country?\\xa0 Does —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 “Do we have enough tests?”\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 Plus, we’re developing new tests.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But they’re not —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 “Do we have enough — do we have enough ventilators?”\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 “Do we have enough hospital beds?”\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 We’ve built 20,000 hospital beds.\\xa0 We have enough hospital beds.\\n\\nGo ahead, Jim.\\xa0 Let’s go.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So what do you say to — I mean, you watch the coverage.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You know what I say?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You’ve been watching a lot of the coverage.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, a lot of it’s fake news.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 These doctors who — no, no, no.\\xa0 Not —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 A lot of it’s fake news.\\xa0 A lot of it’s fake news.\\xa0 Let me just tell you —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 When the doctors and the medical experts come on our air and —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The governors — the governors reported —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — say that we don’t have enough tests, we don’t have enough masks.”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The governor — yeah, depending on your air, they always say that, because otherwise you’re not going to put them on.\\n\\nLet me just tell you something: The governors have said — last night, they had a group of governors, 14 governors.\\xa0 They were together someplace, and they said, “It’s been unbelievable what’s happened.”\\n\\nWe’ve been totally responsive.\\xa0 Ventilators — everyone has the ventilators they need, to a point where we’re getting calls from foreign countries saying, “You have all the ventilators.\\xa0 Can we get some?\\xa0 And we’re going to try and help some of these countries.\\n\\nThese people have done an incredible job.\\xa0 This is not happy talk.\\xa0 Maybe it’s happy talk for you.\\xa0 It’s not happy talk for me.\\xa0 We’re talking about death.\\xa0 We’re talking about the greatest economy in the world.\\xa0 One day I have to close it off.\\xa0 And we did the right thing, because maybe it would have been 2 million people died instead of whatever that final number will be, which could be 60, could be 70, could be 75, could be 55.\\xa0 Thousands of people have died.\\xa0 There’s nothing happy about it, Jim.\\xa0 This is sad talk.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But when you say there’s —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 This is the saddest — these are the saddest — these are the saddest news conferences that I’ve ever had.\\xa0 I don’t like doing them.\\xa0 You know why?\\xa0 Because I’m talking about death.\\xa0 I’m talking about taking the greatest economy ever created — we had the greatest numbers we’ve ever had in almost every aspect of economics, from employment, to companies doing — look at the airlines.\\xa0 They were having the best year.\\xa0 Now, all of a sudden, we have to save them.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nThere’s no happy talk, Jim.\\xa0 This is the real deal.\\xa0 And I’ve got to make the biggest decision of my life.\\xa0 And I’ve only started thinking about that.\\xa0 I mean, you know, I’ve made a lot of big decisions over my life.\\xa0 You understand that.\\xa0 This is, by far, the biggest decision of my life, because I have to say, “Okay, let’s go.\\xa0 This is what we’re going to do.”\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But when you have doctors, when you have hospitals administrators —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 But you have many doctors that say “unbelievable job.”\\xa0 I watched this morning, and I watched a certain network, and it wasn’t Fox, and you had doctors saying that we’ve done an incredible job.\\xa0 You just read off these “no, no, no.”\\xa0 Well, we have ventilators.\\xa0 We have equipment.\\xa0 We have beds.\\xa0 How about beds?\\xa0 I mean, Governor Cuomo just told me, a little while ago, he’s got plenty of beds.\\xa0 In fact, they’re having a hard time filling Javits Center.\\xa0 We built them 2,900 beds.\\n\\nSo that’s not a fair question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But when you’re — when you’re sanitizing masks —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Jim, look — Jim.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and you’re talking —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0Jim.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — about reusing —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Jim.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — PPE, obviously, you don’t have enough of —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no.\\xa0 No, excuse me.\\xa0 We have masks.\\xa0 We have everything.\\xa0 And we were trying to get ready for the surge.\\xa0 And a lot of people said it will never happen.\\xa0 Deborah said it: “You’ll never need that many beds.”\\xa0 They said we needed 40,000 ventilators.\\xa0 Forty thousand.\\xa0 It’s like building a car.\\xa0 Forty thousand ventilators.\\xa0 People said — I felt it too.\\xa0 You’ll never need that many.\\n\\nGuess what?\\xa0 We have tremendous — we have — we’re the envy of the world, in terms of ventilators.\\xa0 Germany would like some.\\xa0 France would like some.\\xa0 We’re going to help countries out.\\xa0 Spain needs them desperately.\\xa0 Italy needs them desperately.\\xa0 Mexico needs them desperately.\\xa0 He asked me last night, “Would it be possible to get 10,000 ventilators?”\\xa0 Within a short period of time, I’ll be able to help out Mexico.\\n\\nNo, Jim — just the opposite of your question.\\xa0 It’s not, “No, no, no.”\\xa0 It’s, “Yes, yes, yes.”\\xa0 We’re in great shape.\\xa0 And you know what?\\xa0 What’s happening now is those numbers are horrible, but take a look at the number of beds.\\xa0 We have beds available all over New York.\\xa0 New York really being the epicenter.\\xa0 New York — New York has experienced something that has been absolutely horrific.\\n\\nI saw Hart’s Island yesterday.\\xa0 I saw those people being buried yesterday.\\xa0 Fortunately, we have the beds.\\xa0 And you can speak to Mayor de Blasio.\\xa0 You can speak to Governor Cuomo.\\xa0 People are — people can’t even believe the job we’ve done.\\xa0 They can’t even believe it.\\n\\nAnd I give tremendous credit to the military.\\xa0 This has been a military operation, with private people.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But wait a minute — wait, wait.\\xa0 I give tremendous credit to our military, to the Army Corps of Engineers, to FEMA, to these people.\\xa0 The job they’ve done is incredible.\\n\\nAnd you shouldn’t be —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But do you accept the criticism that —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — asking that kind of a question.\\xa0 Jim, honestly.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — had the country been better prepared —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Look, I really don’t believe you’re that bad of a guy.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — onset of this —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You shouldn’t be asking that kind of a question.\\xa0 You should say, “You know what?\\xa0 It’s been really incredible what’s been happening.”\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 That’s the reality, Mr. President.\\xa0 That’s the reality.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Jim, nobody is asking.\\xa0 What governor —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You got 2 million tests.\\xa0 That’s not enough —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Let me ask you this:\\xa0What governor —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — tests for everybody around the country.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We have more tests than anybody in the world.\\xa0 We have every —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But that’s not enough for what’s needed right now.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We have virtually every country in the world calling us, asking us: “How do we get these tests that you have?\\xa0 Your testing is the best in the world.\\xa0 How do we get it?\\xa0 They’ve done a fantastic job.”\\n\\nAnd when you ask a question like that, it’s very insulting to a lot of great people.\\n\\nOkay, one more, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 For the doctors —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 You may have seen how Sweden has responded to the pandemic.\\xa0 The schools are open.\\xa0 Bars and restaurants are open.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sweden is different.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you — do you do you regret not following that approach?\\xa0 Is that approach working?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think we could’ve followed that approach.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Could we have that approach?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And if we did follow that approach, I think we might have 2 million people dead.\\xa0 And Sweden is having a lot of difficulty.\\xa0 You know, look, I’m very friendly with the leadership in Sweden.\\xa0 They took a different approach.\\xa0 They’re a very disciplined country to start off with, but they did take a different — and, you know, other places tried it.\\n\\nThe UK tried it — the herd approach, okay?\\xa0 Herd.\\xa0 And they tried it, and you saw what happened in UK.\\xa0 It set them back a lot — a lot of time.\\xa0 It’s been — you know, they’re having a tough time.\\xa0 Other countries have tried it.\\xa0 And Sweden is suffering greatly.\\xa0 I mean, Sweden is suffering greatly.\\n\\nIf we did the herd — if we went with the “herd,” as they say, we would have had potentially — I mean, you see the charts.\\xa0 Nobody knows.\\xa0 Nobody will ever know, fortunately.\\xa0 Because we’re going to be substantially less than the minimum, I certainly hope, unless something happens.\\xa0 That would be tragic.\\xa0 So they had a minimum number, if we did.\\n\\nOne of the reasons we’re so far below that number is because nobody thought the American people could be so disciplined.\\xa0 Nobody thought it was possible.\\xa0 And, I guess, when they watched us up here every day, and they watched other people, and they listened to their representatives and governors — nobody thought that the American people could be so disciplined.\\xa0 They’ve been unbelievable.\\n\\nAnd because of that — so you have a minimum number of 100,000, and then you had the 2.2 number that, if we did nothing — if we did — just kept working, everybody go to work — people would be dropping dead on the subways.\\xa0 No.\\n\\nIf we would have lost a million people — take the 2.2 million and cut it in half.\\xa0 Make it — cut it in more than half.\\xa0 Make it a million people, okay?\\xa0 Now take that number and cut it in half.\\xa0 Make it 500,000 people.\\xa0 That’s if we did nothing, right?\\xa0 It’s unacceptable.\\xa0 It’s too many people.\\n\\nSo we have — we’ve spent more money on stimulus.\\xa0 Who cares by comparison?\\xa0 You take 2.2, you cut it in half, you cut it in half, you cut it in half — you keep cutting it in half.\\xa0 I don’t care what number you choose — 500,000, 400,000.\\xa0 Well, we’re going to have — we’re talking 50, 60, 65 [thousand].\\xa0 Maybe.\\xa0 Maybe.\\xa0 But if we would have done what one country tried — and it has been very tough for them.\\xa0 You know that.\\xa0 Very, very nasty.\\xa0 Very tough.\\xa0 But if we would have done that here —\\n\\nAnd again, you got to remember: UK tried it.\\xa0 And I was a little surprised.\\xa0 And I watched it.\\xa0 They were going about — what, two weeks?\\xa0 And they said, “We got to stop.”\\xa0 Because it was — they were going to have a whole country infected.\\n\\nSo, with all of that being said, we got to get back to work.\\xa0 We got to get — we got to get our country open.\\xa0 But we could have lost 2 million people.\\xa0 We could have lost 1 million people.\\xa0 We could have lost a half a million people.\\n\\nIf we would’ve lost 500,000 people —\\xa0and I’ll say this also: From the standpoint of being President and Vice President, and we’re up there and we’re doing that herd, and we’re going to bullet through — do you honestly think people like Jim and yourself and other people would’ve — Jeff — would have put up with it, as people are dying all over?\\xa0 They would have said, “This man is crazy.”\\xa0 Because the numbers, Tony, at a minimum, would have been many, many times greater than the numbers we’re talking about.\\n\\nSo I’m very honored by our decisions, all of us.\\xa0 We talk about it all the time.\\xa0 I said, “Do you want to let them just –you just ride it.\\xa0 You just ride it right through.”\\xa0 We would have lost potentially millions of people.\\n\\nNo.\\xa0 It would have been unsustainable.\\xa0 It would have been impossible to do.\\n\\nAnd the American people have been so disciplined.\\xa0 It’s been my honor to be their President.\\xa0 I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again, I’ll say it always: It’s been — it’s been my great honor to have been their President.\\n\\nAnd I have a big decision coming up, and I only hope to God that it’s the right decision.\\xa0 But it’ll be based on the input from a lot of very talented people, very smart people, and people that love our country.\\n\\nThank you all very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\n\\nEND\\n\\n4:06 P.M.

       "  'text': 'James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\\n\\n6:24 P.M. EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much, everybody.\\xa0 I’d like to begin by saying that we just completed a meeting with the Secretary of Treasury Steve Mnuchin and Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao on proposals regarding the airlines and the airline business.\\n\\nAnd we’re working very closely with a lot of different people.\\xa0 We’ll be probably putting out a proposal and giving them some of the details — some of the very powerful details over the weekend.\\xa0 It’s moving along quickly.\\xa0 The airline business has been hit very hard, as everybody knows.\\xa0 And we are going to be in a position to do a lot to help them so that they keep their employees and they save their businesses.\\n\\nAnd that’ll be taking place, I think you can say, over the weekend.\\xa0 We may even have discussions with some of the airlines or all of the airlines over the weekend.\\xa0 And I think it’s going to be a very acceptable package.\\xa0 It’s a very big package and a very acceptable package.\\xa0 It’ll be good for our country, good for the airlines, good for a lot of people.\\n\\nLikewise, I just spoke with the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the King of Saudi Arabia, King Salman, and we had a big talk as to oil production and OPEC and making it so that our industry does well and the oil industry does better than it’s doing right now.\\xa0 It’s — the numbers are so low that there’ll be layoffs all over the world.\\xa0 There’ll be certainly layoffs in this country.\\xa0 And we don’t want that to happen.\\n\\nWe built a great, great energy business in the United States.\\xa0 So we have tens of thousands of jobs.\\xa0 We had a very good talk; we’ll see what happens.\\xa0 But as you know, OPEC met today, and I would say they’re getting close to a deal.\\xa0 We’ll soon find out.\\xa0 So that was a conversation we just had, so we had a busy hour and a half.\\n\\nAnd let me begin by expressing my sincere gratitude to the American people.\\xa0 Millions of Americans are making profound and difficult sacrifices in their own lives because they know it will save the lives of countless others.\\xa0 And that’s exactly what it’s doing.\\xa0 You see what’s happening and where we are and where we stand.\\xa0 And hopefully we’re going to be opening up — you can call it “opening” very, very — very, very soon, I hope.\\n\\nTogether, our people are writing one of the most noble chapters in the proud history of our nation.\\xa0 Americans are also encouraged to learn that Boris Johnson, Prime Minister, has been moved out of intensive care.\\xa0 That’s a tremendous statement.\\xa0 And we continue to pray for him and his fast recovery.\\xa0 That’s a very — a very positive development.\\n\\nAs the New York metropolitan area continues its battle against the outbreak, the full power of the federal government is there to support them.\\xa0 As you know, the Javits Center has now been fully converted into a 3,000-bed hospital — one of the\\nlargest anywhere in the country — and by the incredible professionals.\\n\\nI have to say, the Corps of Engineers, what they can do is just incredible.\\xa0 They’ve done a fantastic job and they’re building, nationwide, 21 temporary hospitals and care facilities, adding 17,000 hospital beds.\\xa0 And they did that all within a very short period of time.\\xa0 It’s incredible what they’ve done.\\xa0 Army Corps of Engineers.\\xa0 And FEMA has been fantastic.\\n\\nOur sweeping airlift operation to keep doctors and nurses supplied with protective equipment, Project Airbridge, continues to expand with more than 24 flights already completed and 49 additional flights now scheduled in the near future.\\xa0 So that’s been very successful.\\xa0 And that gear and those outfits are being handed out.\\xa0 As they arrive, they’re going directly to point.\\n\\nThe American medical system continues to perform beyond our highest expectations, reminding us that the United States is blessed with the most advanced healthcare and the most skilled healthcare workers anywhere in the planet.\\xa0 Other countries are looking to what we’re doing.\\xa0 And our testing operation has now become far and away the most sophisticated and the best anywhere.\\n\\nAnd we want to thank all of the heroes on the frontlines as they fight to save American lives.\\xa0 We’re at the top of the hill. \\xa0Pretty sure we’re at the top of the hill, and now we’re going downward.\\xa0 In some cases, we’ve already started that process.\\n\\nEarlier today, I spoke with hundreds of mental health leaders and advocates from around the country to discuss the vital work and the vital work they’re doing.\\xa0 We had the top doctors in the country, some international doctors.\\xa0 Mental health — big factor.\\xa0 Not only has the virus inflicted immense physical suffering on many people, but also mental and emotional suffering as well.\\xa0 Even though we’re staying physically apart, no American is alone, and we’re all in this together.\\xa0 But the mental health doctors and experts — it was a very great call.\\xa0 It was a very interesting call.\\xa0 They’re working very hard.\\n\\nWe’re also seeing encouraging signs in our race to develop breakthrough treatments and therapies.\\xa0 Pfizer revealed today that it has found a promising new treatment that might prevent the virus from replicating.\\xa0 And that hopes — it hopes to begin testing in clinical trials very soon.\\xa0 It’s going to be very, very soon.\\xa0 They have great — great feelings for this particular therapy, and they think that a lot of good things are happening.\\n\\nThrough the FDA’s Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, 19 therapies and treatments are now being tested and 26 more are in the active planning or [for] clinical trial.\\xa0 So we have 19 therapies being tested currently, and 26 more are in the active planning for clinical trials.\\xa0 That’s a big statement.\\xa0 That’s a lot.\\n\\nTrials for Gilead’s antiviral drug, remdesivir, continue.\\xa0 And the company has also expanded emergency use for new patients getting good, early results, by the way.\\xa0 The companies that manufacture hydroxychloroquine are massively ramping up production.\\n\\nAs you know, many people are recommending, strongly, Z-Pak be added — the Z-Pak — and also zinc.\\xa0 And the federal government continues to build our stockpiles and distribute millions of doses for doctors to use as they see fit.\\n\\nAnd I’m pleased to inform you — we’re just having — a lot of good things are happening, but we’ll have to see how that all works out.\\xa0 But we have — we’ve purchased and we have stockpiled millions and millions of doses, and we’re distributing it.\\xa0 Some states want it very badly.\\xa0 Michigan — we just sent a lot to Michigan and other areas.\\n\\nI’m reporting today that we passed 2 million tests completed in the United States, first time — most anywhere in the country.\\xa0 It’s a milestone for our country.\\xa0 It’s a milestone anywhere.\\xa0 Nobody has done anywhere close.\\xa0 Our tests are highly sophisticated and highly accurate.\\n\\nAt the same time, we’re making important progress on the economic front of this war.\\xa0 In a few moments, Secretary of Labor, Eugene Scalia, will explain new steps that we’re taking to ensure American workers swiftly receive unemployment and paid leave benefits and that employers protect the health and safety of all workers, including essential workers on the job, working very, very closely with workers and with employers.\\n\\nTo provide further economic relief, the Federal Reserve announced this morning that it’ll provide up to $2.3 trillion in support to businesses, states, and local governments.\\xa0 Six hundred billion dollars in loans will be available for mid-sized businesses with up to 10,000 employees.\\xa0 And $500 billion will be available for states, counties with over 2 million residents and cities with a population of over 1 million.\\n\\nMy administration is also working with Congress to replenish the very successful — incredibly successful the way it’s going — Paycheck Protection Program, which is allowing hundreds of thousands of small businesses to keep their workers on the payroll, meaning it’ll keep those businesses open.\\n\\nWe need both Democrats and Republicans to come together to get this leg- — the legislation completed.\\xa0 And it looks like it’s on its way, but we need both.\\xa0 And it should be for people that are working for the workers.\\xa0 And if you look and you see, we have a lot of people that are affected by that, and it’s a very positive development.\\xa0 So we have to get a bipartisan approval of that.\\xa0 And hopefully that’ll happen.\\n\\nToday, the Department of Education is also announcing the availability of more than $6 billion in emergency grant funding to assist college students impacted by the cancellation of classes and the suspension of housing.\\xa0 A lot of people had a lot of things suspended; housing is one of them.\\n\\nPreviously, we waived student loan payments for six months.\\xa0 So, student loan payments have been waived for six months, and we’ll discuss it after that.\\xa0 It may go further.\\n\\nAlthough this medical war has separated our citizens for a period of time, it’s also united our entire nation, I think I can say, like almost never before.\\xa0 Americans are moving forward with common purpose and shared resolve, determined to vanquish the virus and lift our nation to even greater heights.\\xa0 We are supremely confident in the magnificent future that awaits the American people.\\n\\nAnd with that, before I invite our Vice President — our great Vice President — and Gene Scalia to speak, we’ll take a few questions.\\xa0 And then I’m going back into negotiations on oil and on airlines.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Could you tell us a little bit more about your conversation with President Putin and the King?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I had a very good conversation.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Did you organize that call?\\xa0 And do they understand the problems they’re causing —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — with the oil output situation?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 No, there’s a lot of — there’s a lot of — there’s so much production, nobody even knows what to do with it.\\xa0 That’s how it’s working.\\n\\nAnd Saudi Arabia and, as you know, Russia — it’s well known that we’re producing a lot, and they were perhaps fighting with each other over the production and the amount of oil being produced.\\xa0 And, frankly, there’s not enough room to even store it.\\xa0 Our storage is now full — going to be very soon.\\xa0 Our Strategic National storage is — I said this is a great time to fill it up, load it up with oil that, frankly, is — had pricing that nobody has ever seen before.\\xa0 I don’t think we’ve seen this probably since the 1950s.\\xa0 That was with big dollars.\\xa0 So we’ll see what happens.\\n\\nThe conversation was very good.\\xa0 They’re getting close to a deal; that’s OPEC and many other countries outside of OPEC.\\xa0 And we’ll see what happens.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are they still fighting with each other?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I think they were getting along very well.\\xa0 We had a very good — we had a very good call.\\xa0 I think it was a very good call.\\xa0 We’re going to see what happens, but it was a very good call.\\xa0 They’ll probably announce something either today or tomorrow, one way or the other.\\xa0 Could be good.\\xa0 Could be not so good.\\xa0 But I think one way or the other —\\n\\nGo ahead, Jim.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, Mr. President, how could the administration discuss the possibility of reopening the country when the administration does not have an adequate nationwide testing system for this virus?\\xa0 Don’t you need a nationwide testing system —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — for the virus before you reopen the economy?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 We have a great testing system.\\xa0 We have the best — right now, the best testing system in the world.\\xa0 But there are certain sections —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But people can’t get the test right now.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 There are certain sections in the country that are in phenomenal shape already.\\xa0 Other sections are coming online; other sections are going down.\\xa0 And we, in addition to that, are giving out millions of tests.\\xa0 And every day, we’re doing it exponentially.\\xa0 We’re picking up.\\xa0 And what we’ll be doing in the very near future is going to certain areas of our country and do massive testing.\\xa0 It’s not necessary, but it would be a good thing to have.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Don’t you have need, though, Mr. President, to make sure people are safe going back to work?\\xa0 You don’t want to send people back to the workplace —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We want to have it, and we’re going to see if we have it.\\xa0 Do you need it?\\xa0 No.\\xa0 Is it a nice thing to do?\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 We’re talking about 325 million people.\\xa0 And that’s not going to happen, as you can imagine.\\xa0 And no — it would never happen with anyone else either.\\xa0 Other countries do it, but they do it in a limited form.\\xa0 We’ll probably be the leader of the pack.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, what do you say to the 16 million Americans — more than 16 million Americans who have lost their jobs in the last three weeks in fear that the economy won’t just bounce back, like you said?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think the economy is going to do very well.\\xa0 Now, that’s just my feeling.\\xa0 It’s a strong feeling.\\xa0 I’ve had good, proper feelings about a lot of things over the years.\\xa0 And I think we’re going to do well.\\n\\nWe’re doing very — it looks like we’re at the lower end of the curve in terms of death, which is a terrible word, a terrible, dark word that we’ve experienced like nobody has ever seen before in this country.\\xa0 I mean, we have numbers that are terrible.\\xa0 But when you look at the lower levels of 100- — lower prediction levels of 100- — 120,000 to 220,000 — or, if we did nothing, up to 2.2 million people — we’re looking at a much lower level than the level of — I hope than the level of 100,000.\\xa0 So we’re going to see.\\n\\nWe’re going to have to — you can never — look, you can never do anything about the people that lost their loved ones and love their — lost their friends.\\xa0 And, I mean, the great friendships.\\xa0 And I’m not sure a lot of people will ever be the same.\\n\\nBut I think our country, from an economic standpoint, will end up being stronger than ever.\\xa0 We have tremendous stimulus.\\xa0 We have tremendous stimulus plans.\\xa0 We have things in the works that are going to really, I think, fire the country.\\n\\nI think that what’s going to happen is we’re going to have a big bounce rather than a small bounce.\\xa0 But we will be back.\\xa0 And I think — honestly, I think our country is going to be back, from an economic standpoint — again, you can never replace the people that were lost.\\xa0 And to their families, certainly you can never do a thing like that.\\n\\nBut we will have succeeded in many ways, hopefully keeping the number way below our minimum numbers.\\xa0 And also, from an economic standpoint — you know, we met with the mental health people today, and that takes a trem- — this has taken a tremendous toll, mentally, on a lot of people.\\xa0 And I think we’re going to open up strong.\\xa0 I think we’re going to open up very successfully, and, I’d like to say, even more successfully than before.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Oil is trading today at about $23 a barrel in New York.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What would you want to see the price?\\xa0 Do you want it at $30, $40, $50 a barrel?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I want to see it where there’s a certain market, but I also don’t want — I don’t want to see it where people are — have no idea — you know, we’re opening up — we’ll be opening up areas for storage of oil — massive areas for storage of oil — because oil today is not selling.\\n\\nAnd what happened is the virus knocked out 40 percent of the market immediate- — you know that; you know the number.\\xa0 Forty percent.\\n\\nNow, there was a lot of oil, but it was very controllable.\\xa0 All of a sudden, they lost 40 percent.\\xa0 You look at the roads, you look at the car — you look at what’s going on; there’s nobody driving.\\xa0 There’s no reason for it right now.\\xa0 That’ll start coming back.\\n\\nBut we are storing millions of barrels of oil that nobody thought would even be possible.\\xa0 Frankly, ships turned out to be a good business for some people because they’re filling up tankers, sending them out to sea, and not saying where to go.\\xa0 They’re just sitting out there loaded up with oil.\\n\\nSo we want to save our energy.\\xa0 In this country, we want to make sure that our energy companies, businesses, and employees, workers remain strong.\\xa0 So that’s how I’m involved.\\xa0 And I think that’s going to happen.\\n\\nSo right now, if you look, you’re probably talking $23, $25.\\xa0 If they announce a deal, we can get it up.\\xa0 We need a minimum number so the companies don’t go out of business, so they’re not going to lay off all of these energy workers who are important to our country.\\n\\nAnd, you know, we’re now energy independent.\\xa0 We could do something where we only used our oil.\\xa0 But I think the long-term benefit is to be able to just go with the market.\\xa0 And it’s going to work out.\\xa0 It’s all going to work out.\\xa0 If you looked at three weeks ago, as you know, because we talked about it, three weeks ago and two weeks ago, this was catastrophic.\\xa0 I think it’s really hitting bottom, and I think that — I mean, we’ve had a bottom.\\xa0 But now at $23 and $25 and probably heading up.\\xa0 At the same time, we save our energy and we also produce great, cheap energy and we save our jobs.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I want to ask you about the Paycheck Protection Program because every day we’re hearing from small business owners who are telling us that their banks don’t know how to access this money, they’re trying to apply, they can’t figure it out.\\xa0 So where does the fault lie?\\xa0 Does it lie with the banks?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t think there’s a fault.\\xa0 We’re — they’re doing record numbers of — of dollars.\\xa0 They’re dealing with many community banks.\\xa0 They’re dealing with Bank of America, Citibank, a lot of — Wells Fargo, as you know, is very much involved.\\xa0 And they’re dealing with the bankers.\\xa0 It can’t go that quickly but I’m hearing it’s a very, very successful rollout.\\n\\nThey did want changes in applications.\\xa0 They want changes in loan requirements, et cetera.\\xa0 But they’re taking billions and billions of dollars’ worth of loans.\\xa0 And in the very near future, the banks will be relieving the money.\\xa0 They’ll be paying out the money.\\n\\nYeah.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you very much, sir.\\xa0 Are you still expecting the USMCA to take effect on July 1st?\\xa0 And considering the fact that the auto industry is hurting these days, are you ready to postpone the (inaudible) on the new rules?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we have a deal.\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 The deal is with Canada.\\xa0 We’re deal- — with Mexico, we have a deal.\\xa0 And obviously the deal is different from the standpoint that production will be lower.\\xa0 But we have a deal.\\xa0 It’s a signed deal.\\xa0 It’s a deal that’s a — one of the worst deals that we’ve ever had was NAFTA.\\xa0 One of the worst trade deals ever made by any country anywhere, and we’ll be terminating that.\\xa0 And the new deal is a great deal for our country.\\xa0 So, that’s something.\\n\\nNow, again, we got hit by the virus, and we’ll see where that all goes.\\xa0 But certainly, car production is going to be down for a little while.\\xa0 But, ultimately, good for our farmers, great for our farmers.\\xa0 We’ll be helping our farmers, by the way.\\xa0 We have money going out to our farmers in the pretty near future, having to do with — you see what’s happened.\\xa0 The farmers got hurt very badly by all of this.\\xa0 People are eating less from the standpoint that there’s — no restaurants are open, no businesses are open, no hotels are open.\\xa0 They’ll start to come back.\\xa0 But we’re going to be helping out our farmers.\\n\\nYeah.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Will you postpone the new auto regulations?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 Philip Wegmann of RealClearPolitics.\\xa0 Earlier, you mentioned Project Skybridge [sic] —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and we’re hearing that, through that project, a lot of the PPE that was sent out to other countries is coming back to this country.\\xa0 Do you — do you know when we’ll be able to bring a majority of that back?\\xa0 And then, are you frustrated that USAID allowed a lot of that aid to go out the door in the first place?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Should they have brought it back before?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I’m not, because we’re — we’re in very good shape.\\xa0 You’ll be speaking with Mike Pence about this in a little while.\\n\\nYou look at the hospitals, you look at what’s going on — I spoke to — yesterday, I spoke with the governor of Louisiana.\\xa0 I’m saying, “Do you think we need that extra thousand beds that we’re in the process of building?”\\xa0 We are really in good shape.\\xa0 You’re not hearing people are needing ventilators much.\\xa0 In fact, we’re going to start helping other countries with ventilators.\\xa0 We’re going to end up having a lot of ventilators for future, should something happen for hospitals — ideally to keep and have.\\n\\nBut, no, I think we’re in very, very good shape.\\xa0 We have calls with governors all the time.\\xa0 And the governors are in very good shape now.\\xa0 We have helped — we have sent billions and billions and billions of dollars between ventilators, equipment, protective equipment, masks.\\xa0 We have 500 million masks coming — 500 million from one group.\\xa0 Five hundred.\\xa0 It’ll be 300 million and 200 million over a short period of time.\\n\\nNo, I think we’re in very good shape.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Speaking of testing, some experts, including Scott Gottlieb, have talked about 750,000 tests per week being needed before the economy is opened.\\xa0 Can you address that?\\xa0 Do you agree with those numbers?\\xa0 If not, how many tests per week do you think we should have before the economy is open, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 I don’t like using the word “needed” because I don’t think it’s “needed,” but I think we’re going to try and hit a number like that.\\xa0 That’s a very high number, but we’re going to be trying to hit it, and we probably might be able to do that.\\n\\nPlease.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 When would you be able to do that, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr.\\xa0President.\\xa0 Today, the Democrats pushed for more rescue money for states and hospitals, which are complaining that they needed to fight the coronavirus pandemic.\\xa0 Do you think hospitals and states need this money?\\xa0 Would you support something like that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I do.\\xa0 And I do support something, but I support it for the next phase.\\xa0 It’s much simpler in the next phase, whether that phase is infrastructure or whatever.\\n\\nSo I’m going to leave you now with Mike Pence and with Eugene Scalia.\\xa0 And if you would — I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.\\xa0 We’ll see you tomorrow.\\xa0 We have a lot of — I think a lot of very big news to report.\\xa0 We’ve had a tremendous day between I believe what’s happening with the energy industry and I believe what’s happening with airlines.\\n\\nI look forward to seeing you.\\xa0 Thank you very much, everybody.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, good afternoon, everyone.\\xa0 At the present moment, we have now cleared more than 2 million tests across the country.\\xa0 And I’m pleased to report we’re testing more than 100,000 people a day now.\\xa0 But we’re — we’re working around the clock to scale up the new types of tests that the FDA has approved in record time.\\n\\nAnd every American can be confident that we’ll continue to build out that structure going forward for the weeks ahead and the months ahead.\\n\\nAt the present moment, there’s more than 450,000 Americans who have tested positive for the coronavirus, and sadly, more than 16,000 Americans have lost their lives.\\xa0 And as President Trump just said, our hearts go out to the families that have lost loved ones.\\xa0 And I want to assure you that all of us working at every level understand these are not numbers, these are lives.\\xa0 And our heartfelt condolences during this heartbreaking week go out to every American family that’s lost a loved one to the coronavirus.\\n\\nIt has been a difficult week.\\xa0 But as Dr. Birx will reflect in just a few moments, as we look at the data, literally on a county-by-county basis every day, we continue to see evidence that — that in areas where the epidemic has impacted most — the Greater New York City area, Louisiana, the Detroit metro, the Denver metro — we continue to see evidence of stabilization.\\xa0 And it appears, as Dr. Birx suggests, that we are — we are close to the peak in each of those areas so impacted.\\n\\nWe also express gratitude and appreciation for the people of California and Washington State who continue to be low and steady and the number of cases that are emerging there.\\n\\nWe’re watching the Chicago metro area.\\xa0 We’re watching the Boston metro area.\\xa0 And as Dr. Birx will discuss, we — we just continue to urge every American to put into practice the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines.\\xa0 Because all evidence indicates, from the West Coast to what we’re beginning to see in major outbreak areas on the East Coast, it’s working, America.\\xa0 And it’s working because you’re doing it.\\xa0 And we encourage you onward in that.\\n\\nToday, the White House Coronavirus Task Force met, but most of the team also met with Republicans and Democrats in two separate conference calls of the United States Senate.\\xa0 Secretary Mnuchin, our health experts, Admiral Polowczyk, Dr. Hahn joined us as we discussed a broad range of issues.\\n\\nThe Treasury Secretary touched on the Paycheck Protection Program, now in day five, reporting $125 billion has been approved so far; 30,000 new individual users and 3,900 lenders are participating.\\n\\nWe also discussed that the Treasury Department will issue a new “frequently asked question” document tonight — an FAQ, as they’re known — to clarify how seasonal businesses can participate in the Paycheck Protection Program as well.\\n\\nWith regard to direct payments to Americans, the Treasury Secretary assured senators, and we assure every American, that we remain on the timetable where the first payments and direct deposits will go out by the end of next week.\\xa0 For the average family of four, that’ll be $3,400 in direct financial support and will no doubt be welcome news.\\n\\nAnyone who is interested in additional information on any of these programs can go to Treasury.gov or SBA.gov.\\n\\nSince we last spoke, I spoke with Governor Laura Kelly of Kansas, Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky.\\xa0 I also spoke to governors of Texas and Rhode Island.\\xa0 I assured each one of them, as we continue to work through the process of making sure that we distribute the resources at the point of the need, is that, at President Trump’s direction, our objective, working through FEMA, is to make sure that states have what they need when they need it.\\n\\nAnd to see the progress that we’ve made — the President just reflected on — in New York and New Jersey, Louisiana, and the partnership we’ve forged with governors in those states; California and Washington State before — we trust, gives confidence to governors and leaders of states across the country and, most importantly, our dedicated healthcare workers that we will be there to meet that need should that need arise.\\n\\nAt the present moment, FEMA reports the President has approved 54 major disaster declarations, and states around the country have stood up 29,000 National Guard, 11,000 of which are fully funded by the federal government under Title 32.\\n\\nAlso, speaking of our military, at the present moment we received a report today from the Department of Defense that 4,100 active-duty military medical personnel have been deployed in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.\\xa0 And they are personnel that are working on the ground, at the Javits Center, working, of course, at the USNS Comfort ship.\\n\\nBut because at the present moment the utilization of both of those temporary facilities has been fairly modest, DOD actually worked with the City of New — in New York to establish what amounts to a uniform temp service.\\xa0 They call it the “bullpen.”\\xa0 And today they literally deployed, from the ship and from the Javits Center, 75 medical personnel to relieve dedicated healthcare workers within the hospital system in the city of New York and we’ll continue to do that.\\n\\nWe’re going to make sure those federal temporary hospital in Javits Center is fully staffed.\\xa0 We’ll make sure that USNS Comfort is staffed.\\xa0 But — but the physicians, those military personnel, are going to be — also be deployed across the city to bring much-needed relief to our healthcare workers and our system.\\n\\nFrom the VA standpoint, we’ve opened up VA facilities in New York City; East Orange, New Jersey; and Detroit, Michigan; and we are opening up the VA facility to coronavirus patients in Shreveport, Louisiana.\\n\\nFinally, I mentioned that today we exceeded more than 2 million tests that have been performed across the country.\\xa0 And also, literally, working with the U.S. Public Health Service, states around the country have stood up hundreds of drive-through testing sites.\\n\\nAnd just this week, FEMA and the U.S. Public Health Service announced that we will give an option to states to transition from a federal testing site — dozens of which have been assembled around the country — to a state-managed site.\\xa0 I want to emphasize that this is an option.\\xa0 We believe it gives states greater flexibility to style sites or manage sites in areas that they think are most important.\\xa0 But — but we’re also processing requests for continued federal participation in states from New Jersey, to Louisiana, to Illinois, Colorado, and Texas.\\xa0 And we want to assure people in communities all across the country that we’ll continue to partner with states to the extent that they prefer us to be a part of it.\\n\\nWith regard to the air bridge, three flights were scheduled to arrive today in Chicago, New York, and Dallas-Fort Worth.\\xa0 Forty-nine flights are scheduled over the next three days.\\n\\nAnd we continue to work supplies.\\xa0 We continue to, literally, leave no stone unturned around America and around the world.\\xa0 We’re literally in the process of acquiring tens of millions of supplies that are being brought into a distribution system, organized out of FEMA, and focused on the areas most in need.\\n\\nWe’re also bringing real innovation.\\xa0 And at the — at the White House Coronavirus Task Force, today, we tasked the FDA and CMS to review the feasibility of allowing hospital workers to use cloth gowns for performing procedures.\\n\\nIt was observed that, 20 years ago, most physicians and most surgeons wore cloth gowns every day and laundered them, but it’s transitioned to disposable gowns.\\xa0 And we’re working very rapidly in the next 24 hours, and we’ll have guidance for hospitals and healthcare workers about the ability to — to, in effect, recycle gowns and make sure that we have the supplies that we need.\\n\\nAs President mentioned today, the President and the First Lady, and I and my wife Karen were honored to be a part of a conference call with mental health professionals from all around the country.\\xa0 And we know while there are families that are struggling with the coronavirus and struggling with heartbreaking loss to the coronavirus, we understand this is a very challenging time for every American, but most especially Americans who struggle with mental disorders or struggle with addiction.\\xa0 And the President brought some incredibly dedicated people together to make sure that they know we’re with them.\\n\\nEarly on, the President expanded access to telemedicine.\\xa0 And we’ve also issued guidance for using technology to remain connected to social support groups.\\xa0 And we just urge everyone — everyone who may be feeling a — an emotional burden or a vulnerability during this time to — to reach out to the many resources that are there and to know that you are not alone, that we’re with you, and we’ll get through this, and we’ll get through this together.\\n\\nSo despite heartbreaking losses that continue this week in communities from New York to New Jersey to Louisiana, there are signs of progress and hope abounds.\\n\\nThe reality is that we see new projections from the experts.\\xa0 And if the projections are right, it’s because it’s working, America.\\xa0 It’s because the American people are putting into practice the social distancing, caring for their neighbors and their loved ones and their family members, and putting their health first.\\xa0 And we just want to urge every American to continue to put those principles and guidelines into practice every day.\\n\\nWith that, I’m going to invite Dr. Deborah Birx up for an update, and Dr. Fauci.\\xa0 We’ll hear from the Secretary of Labor and we’ll take a few questions.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 So I wanted to cover, today, not only what we’re seeing across the United States, but some of the testing data to assure, from the prior question, if we’re testing — I’m sure you’re following our numbers every day and the amount we’re going up.\\xa0 About 118,000 to 120,000 per day are being tested.\\xa0 So we’re way over the 750,000 per week, currently.\\n\\nWe have some statistics.\\xa0 Now remember, we required this, thanks to Congress, to be reported.\\xa0 We have about 75 percent of that test data in now; about 1.5 million of those tests have been reported in.\\n\\nI just wanted to give you some ideas because sometimes we think that we’re only testing in the hospitals, so this should give you an idea of the quantity and the types of tests that have occurred.\\n\\nSo we’ve tested over 200,000 young people, up to age 25.\\xa0 They have about 11 percent positivity rate.\\xa0 Over half a million people between 25 and 45, they have a 17 percent positive rate.\\xa0 Now, remember, in order to get tested, you have to have symptoms.\\xa0 So this gives you an idea of the number of people who have symptoms that are not infected with coronavirus.\\xa0 Another nearly half a million people between 45 and 65, their positivity rate is 21 percent.\\xa0 Another nearly 200,000 between 65 and 85, 22 percent positive.\\xa0 And a small group of about thirty-plus thousand individuals over 85, and they have a 24 percent positivity rate.\\xa0 And so this gives you an idea of — we’re testing throughout all age categories.\\n\\nI see a lot of men in the audience today.\\xa0 I just want to remind them about the importance of healthcare.\\xa0 Of the male-female ratio, 56 percent of the people who are tested are female, 16 percent positive; 44 percent male, 23 percent positive.\\xa0 So again, it gives you an idea about how men often don’t present in the healthcare delivery system until they have greater symptomatology.\\xa0 This is to all of our men out there, no matter what age group: If you have symptoms, you should be tested and make sure that you are tested.\\xa0 We appreciate you engaging in that.\\xa0 And also really recognizing the issues about comorbidities and making sure that we’re addressing those.\\n\\nI had a series of great calls with about 17 states that are in our more rural areas, specifically around our indigenous people and tribal nations.\\xa0 It was a very reassuring call and, you know, we’re testing across the country.\\xa0 We do have about 63 percent of states that have less than 10 percent positive, despite significant testing.\\xa0 And within the indigenous peoples and tribal nations, they’re seeing the same thing that we’re seeing across the nation: increased issues around those with comorbidities and those of elderly, but also issues in nursing homes.\\n\\nAnd so we’re really — they are testing — many of these states are still capable of doing full contact tracing.\\xa0 And so they’ve been doing contact tracing from nursing home outbreaks and other outbreaks.\\n\\nIt really gives us a clear impression of — no matter what we do in the future, we need to really ensure that nursing homes have sentinel surveillance.\\xa0 And what do I mean by that?\\xa0 That we’re actively testing in nursing homes, both the residents and the workers, at all times.\\xa0 That is where — and that’s how we saw this at the beginning.\\xa0 That’s what we saw in Washington State.\\xa0 And that’s what we’re seeing in many of the states that have very low case attack rates.\\n\\nThe other thing that I want to leave you with — I mean, we certainly know how desperate and difficult the situation has been in New York over the last few weeks.\\xa0 And we’ve been telling and talking about how this would be the week that would be most difficult because of the large proportion of cases that are coming from the New York metro area.\\n\\nWhat’s been encouraging to us — those early states, outside of Washington and California, which still have extraordinarily low attack rates because of their level of mitigation, all of the new areas that are having new increase in cases — we talked about them yesterday, Washington and Baltimore, and the Philadelphia metro area that includes Camden, Wilmington, and the counties around Philadelphia — we’re seeing that the case numbers — what we’ll get to as far as attack rates.\\xa0 And we talked about one in seven in a thousand in New York that are being measured.\\xa0 These are coming in, even with their progress up, their curve in the one- to two-per-thousand range, showing that when you start mitigation early, it has a very different impact.\\n\\nAll of this data is coming together.\\xa0 The testing rates, the seropositivity, the age groups, who really needs hospitalization, ICU, the innovative pieces coming from — we heard a great report from Louisiana this morning on that phone call where they talked about a minimum now of 40 percent of people coming out of ventilators alive and leaving the hospital.\\n\\nThis is very encouraging to us.\\xa0 It really shows amazing progress, clinically, at each of these hospitals, and the real lessons — what we’re learning and sharing across hospitals.\\xa0 But really shows us that the original outbreaks were very large, but the newer ones that we talk about in Washington and Philadelphia and Baltimore, it looks like their attack rates and the attack rates in Denver and some of these other states that we have been talking about are much lower than New York and New Jersey.\\n\\nAnd this gives us hope about really understanding how to integrate this information together — not dealing with the model but the real-life cases that are occurring, and understanding how to move forward together to really have a different future.\\n\\nSo thank you very much.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Dr. Fauci?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 So just reflecting about what we’ve been doing over the last few days — remember last weekend when we made the forecast that this would really be a bad week?\\xa0 As I mentioned yesterday and the day before, it is, in the sense of deaths, a bad week.\\xa0 In fact, every day there seems to be a record of number of deaths compared to the day before.\\xa0 In fact, New York, today, had again another record of — I think the city itself was about 820-plus deaths.\\n\\nBut what we were predicting — with the increase and the real adherence to the physical separation, the guidelines that the Vice President talks about, the physical separation — at the same time as we’re seeing the increase in deaths, we’re seeing rather dramatic decrease in the need for hospitalizations.\\xa0 Like, I think yesterday, it was something like 200 new hospitalizations and it’s been as high as 1,400 at any given time.\\xa0 So that is going in the right direction.\\n\\nI say that — and I always remind myself when I say that — that means that what we are doing is working, and therefore we need to continue to do it.\\xa0 I know I sound like a broken record.\\xa0 That’s good.\\xa0 I want to sound like a broken record.\\xa0 Let’s just keep doing it.\\n\\nI get questions a lot — Dr. Birx and I — about these numbers, the projections that you went with — from 100,000, 200,000, now down to 60,000.\\xa0 That’s a sign that when — as I keep saying — when you take the data you have and you reinsert it into the model, the model modifies.\\xa0 Data is real; model is hypothesis.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 So that’s what you have to do and that’s what I think we’re seeing.\\n\\nThe other thing that — some just broad, general, good news from the standpoint of a scientific standpoint: that there are a lot of candidate, potential therapeutics that are going into clinical trials now that we’re sponsoring at the NIH.\\xa0 The kinds of clinical trials that will give us the answer: Are they safe?\\xa0 Are they effective?\\xa0 And just what is the — the capability of using them under what circumstance — as prophylaxis, as treatment in early disease, in late disease?\\n\\nSo as the time goes by and we have the public health measures to try and contain this, we’re doing an awful lot from a scientific standpoint so that when we do get to next year, next fall, next winter, hopefully we’ll have something that we can offer in addition to the very important public health measures.\\n\\nSo I’ll be happy to answer questions later.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Mr. Secretary.\\n\\nSECRETARY SCALIA:\\xa0 Mr. Vice President, thank you.\\xa0 And thanks to the task force.\\xa0 And, of course, thanks to the President for his leadership.\\n\\nThe important public health measures that have been discussed so much in these briefings in this room have had a large impact in American workplaces.\\xa0 We saw that again today as the Labor Department released figures showing that 6.6 million new unemployment claims were filed last week.\\xa0 We’re all mindful — the President mentioned this — that the American people are making difficult sacrifices.\\xa0 That has included being furloughed, laid off, or having — having a small-business struggle.\\n\\nThat said, American workers can be encouraged by how swiftly and comprehensively the President and Congress have responded.\\xa0 Three weeks ago, the U.S. had never had a law requiring paid sick leave at U.S. companies.\\xa0 But three weeks ago, the President signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which did provide paid sick leave, as well as expanded family and medical leave for employees at small businesses, with those small businesses being reimbursed dollar for dollar for having provided that leave.\\n\\nLast week we at the Labor Department issued rules to implement these leave requirements of the Families First Act, and we’ve been in near constant contact with employers and employees to help them understand the law, and, in a number of cases already, to help workers get the leave that they were entitled to.\\n\\nAnother unprecedented benefit for workers was provided in the CARES Act less than two weeks ago.\\xa0 That law, as you know, includes a $600-a-week plus-up to unemployment benefits that are provided by the states.\\xa0 We have millions of unemployed Americans who are making a sacrifice for our national wellbeing.\\xa0 These bonus payments — and they’re unprecedented.\\xa0 The government has never provided a plus-up unemployment payment like this.\\xa0 These payments are intended to make those workers whole, as near we can.\\n\\nThis temporary benefit is available not just to employees, but also to the self-employed and gig-economy workers.\\xa0 Before the President signed the CARES Act, gig workers, independent contractors were not available for unemployment compensation.\\xa0 Today, they are.\\n\\nAt the Department, our team has worked day and night to enable states to make this benefit available.\\xa0 I’m pleased that a number of states are now making those $600 additional weekly payments.\\xa0 More states will follow in the coming days.\\xa0 How long it takes will vary by states.\\xa0 Some system — some state systems will take longer.\\xa0 But we at the Department will continue to support them.\\xa0 We have already dispersed half a billion dollars to states to help them with their systems and making these payments.\\xa0 We have another half a billion dollars that we’re ready to release.\\n\\nAnd for workers who don’t get this benefit when it’s first due them, states will be able to catch them up later when their computer systems are able to make these payments.\\n\\nLet me add that we’re also mindful at the Labor Department that many Americans remain in the workplace, including on the frontlines in our hospitals, as well as our emergency responders.\\n\\nMy Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration — or OSHA — has been providing guidance to employers and employees on coronavirus since the early days of this health emergency.\\xa0 We are fielding and responding to calls from workers worried about their health, and sometimes from workers who believe they’ve been illegally disciplined by their employer for expressing health concerns.\\xa0 We will not tolerate retaliation.\\xa0 OSHA will continue to work with workers and employers to keep workplaces safe, using all the tools available to us, including enforcement if needed.\\n\\nI wanted to finish by commenting on the Paycheck Protection Program, which we heard about earlier, run by the Small Business Administration.\\xa0 This, of course, is loans to small businesses to enable them to meet certain costs, including utilities, rent, and, most important from my perspective, payroll.\\n\\nAs you know, if these companies receiving loans keep their workers on paylo- — on payroll, these loans are largely forgivable.\\n\\nHere’s why that program is so important, from my perspective:\\xa0We’re seeing unemployment filings right now of a like that we’ve never seen before.\\xa0 But these numbers aren’t the result of an underlying weakness to our economy.\\xa0 Our economy has been vibrant — incredibly strong just weeks ago.\\xa0 If — as we’ve heard again today, if we are disciplined now and adhere carefully to the guidance being provided by health authorities, we’ll get that economy back.\\n\\nThe President spoke at the State of the Union of the blue-collar boom we are experiencing.\\xa0 We want to lay the ground- — groundwork now for a blue-collar bounce back.\\xa0 We’ll get there in part by helping companies hold onto their workers, which is what the Pay- — Paycheck Protection Program does.\\xa0 Keep them on payroll so that, when businesses are ready to reopen, they have the workers they need and Americans have jobs.\\n\\nWe will continue — at the Department and, I know, here at the White House — to be laser focused on American workers and jobs until this is done.\\n\\nSo thank you very much.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Very well done, Mr. Secretary.\\xa0 Good job.\\xa0 Great.\\xa0 We’ll take a few questions.\\n\\nYes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Vice President, a question for you and then a question for Dr. Birx or Dr. Fauci.\\xa0 Just to clarify: On the federal funding for testing sites in the states, are you saying that federal funding will remain for those sites, and will it remain at its current levels?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s not merely federal funding, but in many cases, we’ve provided personnel from the U.S. Public Health Service, and also flowed supplies, personal protective equipment that was required for some of the early forms of testing.\\xa0 But it’s less required today with new formats for testing.\\n\\nBut it’s — it is an option.\\xa0 And as I’ve made clear to several governors, we’ll — we’ll continue to partner with our states.\\xa0 But I — I have to tell you that the way states stepped forward with the concept of drive-through and community-based testing is really inspiring.\\xa0 For our part, working with FEMA and our great team at the U.S. Public Health Service, we’ve stood up some nearly 50 different drive-through test sites around the country.\\xa0 But, literally, there are hundreds that have been deployed by states and by hospitals and local healthcare providers.\\n\\nBut, in this instance, we — we wanted to at least give them the option to take control of that.\\xa0 But we’ll continue to resource them with personnel, supplies, and — and any other support that they need going forward.\\xa0 And —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And then just a question for the Doctors.\\xa0 I’m curious if — did you see this information out of the CDC in South Korea today that shows that they’re seeing evidence of reinfection in some people who have been cured of coronavirus?\\xa0 And what does that mean for our understanding of this?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Have you seen that?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0\\xa0 I’m not aware of what you’re speaking about now, but clearly, there have been anecdotal mentioning of what appear to be reinfection.\\xa0 You have to really be very careful when you say reinfection, because — and we were dealing with this with even Ebola, back during the Ebola time, that someone might still — when that someone does a test on them, do a PCR on a body fluid of some sort and be able to detect what are likely nucleotides that are not replication competent.\\n\\nSo if you’re — if you’re telling me — which I don’t think they’re saying — that someone has coronavirus disease, they get sick, it’s documented, they get better, and then a month or so later they get sick with documented coronavirus disease, I don’t think that’s what they’re saying.\\xa0 But I don’t want to jump the gun on it until I see the data.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 They used the word “reactivate.”\\xa0 Is that different?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Well, yeah, what “reactivating” would mean is that — it depends what you mean by “reactivating.”\\xa0 If someone clearly is ill and they have virus isolated from them, that you may have a prolonged course.\\xa0 I’d like to see how long they reactivate.\\xa0 I mean, if they were sick and had documented virus, and then three months later, they had documented virus, is that reactivation or is that infection with another virus?\\xa0 I’d like to see the data before I really comment on that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I ask you a question, Dr. Fauci?\\xa0 Dr. Fauci, I wanted — I wanted to ask about medical criteria.\\xa0 You had a discussion with Dr. Birx and the other public health experts on Tuesday, I understand.\\xa0 Can you discuss what is the medical criteria that you guys are discussing in order to reopen the government?\\xa0 What is the medical criteria?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Well, it’s less medical criteria than it is public health criteria.\\xa0 And that is — and I think it’s really important because often people say, “Reopen the government,” like it’s a light switch that goes on and off for the entire country.\\n\\nWe have a very large country with really different patterns of disease and outbreaks in different parts of the country.\\xa0 So it’s not going to be one-size-fits-all.\\xa0 It’s going to be: What is the kinetics of an outbreak?\\xa0 Is it on the way down?\\xa0 Is it essentially out?\\xa0 Is it still smoldering and possibly going up?\\xa0 I think you’re going to have to take it individually and —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are there some benchmarks that you’re looking at, though?\\xa0 I mean, are there certain numbers that you’re looking at, some data that you would like to see?\\xa0 What would you like to see before that happens?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah, well, I’ll allow Dr. Birx to come up.\\xa0 But just my own opinion: I don’t think they’re going to be benchmarks that are going to be consistent from one to the other.\\n\\nFor example, I would not want to pull back at all in New York until I was clear that that curve really was doing what we’ve seen in other countries — a very steep decline down — and we had the capability, if there was a resurgence, of having everything in place to be able to do the containment, as opposed to struggling with mitigation with what we’ve been doing.\\n\\nThat’s different than a relatively smaller city, town, or whatever you in the Midwest or mountain regions, which is generally very well controlled.\\xa0 But I wouldn’t want to see — do we have the capability of doing the isolation, contact tracing, and suppression of it?\\xa0 So it really varies differently.\\xa0 So I don’t think there’s one medical criteria.\\n\\nBut Deb —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 If you want to speak to it.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 So it’s what I tried to cover in the brief presentation I gave.\\xa0 In talking to the 17 states that have indigenous populations and tribal nations and discussing with them what they were doing generally and what they were doing specifically through the Indian Health Service, they discuss the ability to find new cases and doing full contact tracing.\\n\\nAnd so they are — they have strike teams, they are very well organized.\\xa0 You don’t hear about them every day, and I — that’s why I wanted to call them out.\\xa0 They’re really doing amazing work at their public health institutions, with their governors and their mayors.\\xa0 And they are really — they are in full contact tracing.\\n\\nYes, they’re doing social distancing, but they’re also doing full contact tracing and understanding all aspects of their epidemic.\\xa0 So we’re looking at those pieces as well as when I was talking about blunting, really — when you’re starting to go up that curve, having that unbelievable blunting where you only get evident attack rates.\\xa0 And I want to be very clear about that.\\xa0 When we see cases, these are symptomatics that have been diagnosed.\\xa0 There’s clearly, we believe, people we don’t see.\\xa0 And that’s why the antibody test is going to be helpful to us to really define that.\\n\\nSo those are the pieces that we’re bringing together to really analyze that.\\xa0 I did want to say, the President talks about the 150-plus countries that are in — experience what we’re experiencing.\\xa0 I just wanted to do a call-out: We have Americans around the world in every embassy that are working with those countries now.\\xa0 This scarf came from Africa.\\xa0 It’s one of my public health colleagues there.\\xa0 I just want to recognize that public health colleagues around the world who are doing all of this work together to change the course in their epidemics in every single country around the globe.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Let me go to another question, if I can.\\xa0 But in response to that, just so you know, what the President has tasked us to do is there’s a number of working groups and — that are that are looking at not only how do we — how do we reopen the country, but how do we stay open.\\xa0 And I think most of America knows that no one wants to reopen America more than President Donald Trump.\\xa0 But the President has told us we need to do it responsibly, and we’re going to follow the data.\\xa0 We’re literally following the data on a county-by-county basis.\\n\\nThis morning, we were literally presented with information of each county that had more than 100 new cases and had — you know, went in the other direction; had, you know, less than 100 than the day before.\\xa0 It’s really remarkable.\\n\\nAnd so I think what you hear the health experts saying will inform the President’s decision and timing.\\xa0 But make no mistake about it, that the best thing we can do to reopen America is put the coronavirus behind us, to reach the — to reach the end of that curve with as little loss of life or hardship as possible; to have in place, that we soon believe we will, the kind of therapeutics — I call them medicines that make you feel better — by this summer; to have more widespread testing that we’re scaling up each and every day; and also to have the kind of guidance that the CDC is even now developing for businesses large and small, for families and for schools, for that day that we do reopen America.\\n\\nQuestion?\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If I could just ask one more follow-up to the doctors.\\xa0 It touches on this question of when to lean back on mitigation.\\xa0 There is a study out of Los Alamos this week that I hope you’ve seen.\\xa0 It’s on the CDC website.\\xa0 It looks at this question of are R-naught, which — it’s a technical term that you understand, and it has to do with the reproductive rate of the virus.\\n\\nThe study shows that the R-naught for coronavirus isn’t between two and three, as had been thought before, but it’s actually closer to six, which means that one person, on average, is infecting six others.\\xa0 So with this information, how does that impact the model?\\xa0 How can you begin to think about when to reopen society if it’s more contagious than we thought before?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I can tell you as the layperson on the stage —\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Go for it.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — we have known from the beginning that this is at least three times more contagious than the flu.\\xa0 And I believe that that fact alone has informed our projections and the modeling.\\n\\nBut now I’ll let he experts respond.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But it’s twice as contagious as you thought it was.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 I’ll go quickly, and then —\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 And then I’ll go —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 We’ll tag team together.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So, when we’ve been talking about the asymptomatic group — and that’s why I gave you that testing data where 11 percent of young people under 25 were positive, many of them with very low-grade symptoms.\\n\\nWhat we will be triangulating for you is the testing data with hospital admissions, and then you’ll be able to start seeing spectrum of disease.\\xa0 Because what you’re not seeing in spectrum of disease is people who never even think that this is something significant that — than what they have.\\xa0 We’re seeing the significant cases.\\n\\nWhen testing, you can see that we’re getting a lot of people in with symptoms, who aren’t positive.\\xa0 And so really finding out what is the R-naught. \\xa0Is it six?\\xa0 Is it five?\\xa0 And the only way to do that at this point right now is to get the antibody tests out there and go into these places that had significant disease.\\xa0 When we talk about attack rates of seven per thousand, like New York; and five per thousand in New Jersey; and test the healthcare workers, the first responders, all of the nursing homes for antibody and really get to your question — because right now, it’s still theoretic.\\xa0 We understand they’re modeling this.\\xa0 And we are — we will get the data to actually look at that.\\n\\nYou will see what others have been presenting.\\xa0 So you presented the six.\\xa0 What others are presenting, importantly, is they’re modeling what’s happening with mitigation.\\xa0 And they’re publishing that the R-naught with mitigation is approaching like 1.3 and 1.5.\\xa0 So that — think of what that is.\\xa0 If it was six, and then with mitigation we have it into the ones, that really shows the power of the American people.\\n\\nNo one has varied R-naughts like that without a vaccine, but this is what’s happening with the — really, the power of the American people.\\n\\nTony.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Tony.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Ditto to everything that Dr. Birx said, but I couldn’t help but thinking when you talk about — you know what the worst enemy of an R-naught is?\\xa0 Physical separation.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But do we have enough testing —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 How about one more?\\xa0 One more.\\xa0 Go right ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do we have enough testing capacity in the country right now to reopen in the foreseeable future?\\xa0 I mean, because the President talked about 2 million tests.\\xa0 Are we going to have the testing capacity needed to make Americans feel comfortable going back into their workplaces?\\xa0 I mean, it seems to me that is a pretty critical question at this point.\\xa0 People are not going to want to go back to work if they think their coworkers might be carrying the virus.\\xa0 If we’re not testing enough, how do we know it’s safe to go back?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think the American people see the incredible progress that’s been made after President Trump brought in the largest commercial labs in the world to scale testing, the likes of which we’ve seen.\\xa0 We are, as Dr. Birx said, well over 100,000 Americans being tested every single day.\\n\\nWe have an antibody test that is coming online.\\xa0 Abbott Laboratories literally has thousands of machines across the country.\\xa0 We’re working with hospitals and labs around the country to activate those machines for the 15-minute test.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Forgive me, Mr. Vice President: Do we have enough testing right now?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, let me — let me say, we’re — we’re moving every day toward meeting that moment.\\xa0 But let’s be clear: Reopening the country, as the President is very anxious to do at the earliest responsible moment, will be through a combination of facts.\\xa0 First would be that we are at the end of the coronavirus for most major communities.\\xa0 Another piece of that is that we — we have therapeutics for Americans to take medicines if they contract the disease.\\n\\nAnother piece of that is guidance from the CDC to public institutions to businesses large and small about how to conduct themselves in a safe and a responsible way.\\xa0 And testing is also a piece of that.\\xa0 And as Admiral Giroir has reflected, we — we are spending a great deal of time expanding testing today.\\xa0 Every single day there’s more and more tests across the country.\\n\\nBut we’re also working to scale testing — that, as we move into this summer and move into the fall, we’ll have the testing we need to do what these doctors call not “diagnostic testing” — which is to take a test of a person that has symptoms — but “surveillance testing,” so we can identify people that may have had it and may be immune versus people also — people that we just need to know whether or not they were — they were ever exposed or — and were not exposed.\\n\\nHow about — how about one more quick question here, if I can?\\xa0 I think he had one right here.\\xa0 Or I’ll go to you in the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 In the next few weeks, the Supreme Court is set to rule on DACA, about the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival.\\xa0 And about 30,000 of those people who are under that program are frontline healthcare workers.\\xa0 Is the administration in any way ready to protect them if the ruling comes in your favor and takes the protection out, and they can no longer work in the health field as they’re needed right now?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think the President has been very clear on his desire to reach a solution on that issue with the Congress.\\xa0 But let me — let me say, whether it be healthcare workers or people working in food supply, other people working in critical infrastructure, we’re — we’re incredibly inspired by the way people across this country are stepping up to keep — keep healthcare rolling and available, a high quality of care, even in areas deeply impacted by the coronavirus.\\n\\nAnd also, as we said the other day, hardworking people in our food supply, from the farmers to processors, to distributors, to truck drivers, to grocers — we received a good word that, over the last several days, we’ve actually seen a significant drop with one major company in absenteeism.\\n\\nWe issued new guidance from the CDC about how people who may have been within close proximity to someone who had the coronavirus could return to work before the 14 days if they didn’t have a fever, if they tested themselves twice a day, and returned with a mask.\\n\\nBut the dedication of people to continue to work is — is truly inspiring.\\xa0 And I know, as we go forward, we’ll — we’ll work through a broad range of national issues.\\xa0 But we’re going to be incredibly proud for a long time by the way that people all across this country responded to this moment.\\n\\nSo thank you all very much.\\xa0 We’ll see you tomorrow.\\n\\nEND\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\n\\n7:28 P.M.

EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 This is a holy week, when religious believers across the nation will observe Passover, Good Friday, and Easter.\\xa0 Millions of Jewish families begin Passover at sundown tonight, a sacred, unbroken tradition that traces back to the ancient land of Egypt.\\xa0 And on Sunday, we celebrate our beautiful, wonderful Easter, which we all look forward to.\\xa0 And we’re going to have many Easters together in churches in the future.\\n\\nWe’re getting closer.\\xa0 You see the numbers.\\xa0 We’re getting much closer to getting our country back to the way it was.\\xa0 We have now an extra two countries that have been attacked: 184. They’re being attacked as we speak, but we’ll all win.\\xa0 At some point, we’re going to all win.\\xa0 We’re going to do it sooner than people think.\\n\\nEarlier today, I spoke with 10,000 of America’s faith leaders to thank them for raising the spirits of our people during these very difficult days.\\xa0 While we may be physically apart, we can use this time to pray, to reflect, and to focus on our personal relationship with God.\\n\\nI also spoke with more than 3,000 mayors, county commissioners, and state and tribal leaders to provide an update on our administration’s ongoing drive to beat the virus, to crush the virus.\\xa0 And that’s happening.\\xa0 And it’s happening, I think if you look, a little bit more quickly than people thought.\\xa0 Maybe a lot more quickly, I hope.\\xa0 And it’s something that all over the world we’re watching, but people are watching us and seeing what we’re doing, and they’re very impressed.\\nWe’re dealing with many countries right now. \\xa0Many, many countries.\\xa0 And we’re giving them whatever information we’re able to glean.\\n\\nI just spoke with the representatives of the UK, and I think that their great prime minister is doing much better today, or at least better.\\xa0 But certainly he’s had a tough bout, and he’s still going through a tough time, but he seems to be doing better.\\xa0 And that’s good.\\n\\nAnd we — we send our regards to Boris and his family and his friends, all of the people that really love him.\\xa0 He’s — he’s become a very popular — before this happened, became a very popular prime minister.\\xa0 He’s doing an excellent job.\\xa0 He loves their country; he loves our country.\\xa0 So we appreciate everything he’s done, and hopefully he’s going to be okay.\\n\\nSpeaking of great people, and people that have done a fantastic job, I have Secretary of State Mike Pompeo with us. And I’d like to ask Mike to say a few words.\\xa0 And then I think what we’ll do, in order to get him back to the State Department, we’ll take some questions and we’ll then go on with the rest of what I’m going to say.\\xa0 And then we’ll take some questions after that, and then Vice President Pence will take over.\\n\\nSo, Mike Pompeo, please.\\n\\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President. Under the President’s leadership, my team and I at the State Department are doing our part to protect the American people from the virus and, importantly, to get them home.\\n\\nAs you know, when many countries shut down their rail lines, their buses, their infrastructure systems, the capacity to get out of those countries — they were trapped, they’re stranded — the State Department swung into action.\\n\\nSince January 29th, we have now repatriated over 50,000 United States citizens back to their homes from more than 90 countries, more than 490 flights back to the United States from all across the world.\\xa0 This worldwide scale of our repatriation efforts is without parallel in our lifetime.\\xa0 We are coordinating with foreign governments, militaries, airport authorities, medical units, transportation companies, hotels, you name it.\\xa0 We’re working with them to make sure the American people get back to be with their families.\\n\\nYou can see, behind me, the map of the flights, that we have brought back people —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good.\\n\\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\\xa0 — from all across the world.\\xa0 Every day, I get a chance to hear some of the remarkable stories from our team.\\xa0 Let me give you just a couple of examples.\\n\\nOur mission in Peru: Working with the Peruvian military and police forces to send riverboats up the — up the river to get citizens that were stranded deep inside the Amazon forest.\\n\\nOur mission in Nepal: Make sure that a woman who was running low on medication could get what she needed at a pharmacy before boarding an evacuation flight that brought her back here.\\n\\nIn Honduras: After the government imposed a very strict 24/7 curfew and closed airports, our embassy sprang into action for stranded Americans — thousands of them.\\n\\nA three-year-old boy told one of our consular officers just before he boarded the flight, “Thank you for helping me get back home to my dad.”\\xa0 Pretty neat.\\n\\nWe’ve received similar messages from lots of people.\\xa0 They’re proud to know that their country will not leave them stranded and we’re going to get them back home.\\n\\nOne woman wrote, quote, “I was in tears when I received the e-mail approving our flight back to the United States.\\xa0 God bless the United States of America.”\\xa0 And another said, “I felt like I had allies there that actually treated me like a person or a family member, not just a number.”\\n\\nThe Repatriation Task Force at State Department, our consular officers have done great work.\\xa0 I want to thank our partners in the Department of Defense who have helped with some of these flights back home and other government agencies — our sisters and brothers across the United States government in this administration that have helped get these people back.\\n\\nAnd then, lastly, aside from our repatriation efforts, we continue to help countries around the world as well.\\xa0 We’ve got CDC officials helping these countries with expertise and all the things that these countries need to get their citizens safe and healthy and back so that we can get the economy all across the world — the global economy — back on its feet when this crisis is over.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Very good.\\xa0 Thanks, Mike.\\xa0 Maybe you stick for a little while —\\n\\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — and we’ll see if anybody has any questions for Secretary of State.\\n\\nAnybody?\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 Mr. Secretary, that’s an amazing effort that you have made.\\xa0 How do you know when you’re done?\\xa0 Because I imagine there are Americans on all corners of the world, and you’re always — someone is going pop up and say, “I want to go home now.”\\n\\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\\xa0 It’s a great —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 When will you give the all — call that it’s over?\\n\\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 So, it’s a great question.\\xa0 We still have several thousand people that we’re working.\\xa0 They identify themselves every day.\\xa0 New people find themselves in a difficult place.\\xa0 Look, we’re going to be done when people can travel on the road again.\\xa0 These people traveled abroad on vacations or with their church and were intending to get back on their own.\\xa0 We hope that day comes pretty soon, where they don’t have to rely on the State Department to get them back home.\\n\\nBut know this: In the meantime, we’re devoting all the resources we have to get them — they’re in — often in difficult places.\\xa0 They’re not in the capital, near the airport, or the roads are closed.\\xa0 And so it’s not just a matter of getting a flight down there.\\xa0 There’s a lot of work that has to be done to coordinate, to make it all happen and get those people available so they’re sitting there when the flight lands, they can get on the plane, and then we can get them back home.\\n\\nWe still have several thousand.\\xa0 We’re working on it.\\xa0 We chip away at that number every day.\\xa0 But new citizens go to the State Department website, identify themselves, and say, “I need a little bit of help, in some way,” and we do our best to get that to them just as quickly as we can.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you’ll keep it up indefinitely?\\n\\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\\xa0 We’re going to keep it up as long as we have resources to do it and there is a need.\\n\\nYes, sir.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Secretary, how many of these staffers have tested positive for coronavirus?\\xa0 Have they been tested?\\xa0 Are they going into quarantine?\\xa0 And what does this do to diplomatic efforts overseas if you’re pulling 50,000 people out of state capitals — or national capitals, nation capitals all over the world?\\n\\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\\xa0 So the vast majority of these 50,000 weren’t our officers.\\xa0 These were ordinary citizens who were there, traveling for business or for commercial or for their trip of a lifetime.\\xa0 We’ve seen some of them in the cruise ships, but of course they’re stranded all over the world.\\n\\nSo our embassies — save for the one that is in Wuhan, which we did pull everybody out of — the rest of our facilities around the world are all open.\\xa0 We’ve had a handful of our folks now test positive, but we feel like we have a good handle on it and we’re doing everything we can to make sure that not just the State Department officials, but our Department of Defense colleagues that are working on these missions as well are doing so in a way that reduces risk to them and their wellbeing also.\\n\\nYes, ma’am.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you so much.\\xa0 Do you feel like China held — withheld critical information from the United States?\\xa0 And will there be any consequences for that?\\n\\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\\xa0 You know, this is not the time for retribution, but it is still the time for clarity and transparency.\\xa0 We’re still working on this problem set.\\xa0 There’s still data that these good people need so that they can perform their analysis of how to both develop therapeutics and a vaccine and to understand where this virus is.\\n\\nSo, every country, China included — every country needs to be transparent about what’s gone on in their country.\\xa0 They need to share that data — we share ours with the world — so that the best scientists in the world can get to the right conclusions and bring this economy, this global economy back to the place that we all want it to be as quickly as we can.\\n\\nEvery country has that responsibility.\\xa0 It started in China, and so they had that special responsibility to get it right quickly and fast.\\xa0 Ask every country.\\xa0 As we move forward in the days and weeks ahead, make sure we share that.\\xa0 Do it — do it right.\\xa0 Do it well.\\xa0 And when we do, we’ll get this thing back on.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But early on, should they have shared their data sooner with the United States?\\n\\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\\xa0 Every country has an obligation to share that information accurately, timely, completely, transparently, and thoroughly, just as quickly as they can gather it.\\xa0 We’ll leave for another time to evaluate how everyone did in that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 In the middle, and then him behind.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you, President Trump and Secretary.\\xa0 I have a question.\\xa0 The World Health Organization has a fundraising drive for about $700 million for coronavirus resources.\\xa0 China has only donated $20 million.\\xa0 The United States actually has donated less.\\xa0 So do you feel that China should be giving more to this World Health Organization effort?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You can say we helped.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And can you comment on the U.S. donation?\\n\\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\\xa0 Do you want to say something, Mr. President?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, you can just say we helped.\\n\\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\\xa0 We — at this point, we’re reevaluating our funding with respect to the World Health Organization.\\xa0 You know, this is very consistent with what President Trump said since the beginning of his campaign: Organizations have to work.\\xa0 They have to deliver the outcomes for which they were intended.\\xa0 And we need to make sure that not only the World Health Organization, but every international organization that we take taxpayer money and give it to them for the benefit of America — we need to make sure it’s delivering on those taxpayer dollars.\\n\\nThe World Health Organization is no different in that respect.\\xa0 They have to execute on the mission that they are designed to achieve.\\xa0 And we’ve seen, with respect to the World Health Organization, here we are.\\xa0 We haven’t — it hasn’t accomplished what it was intended to deliver.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President and Mr.\\xa0Secretary.\\xa0 You said a handful of staffers have tested positive.\\xa0 Are they going to get the hydroxychloroquine treatment?\\xa0 Is that going to be made available to personnel overseas?\\n\\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\\xa0 I don’t know the answer to that.\\xa0 But — but know that we’ll deliver the best medical care every place we can.\\xa0 Some of them are in difficult places where there’s not a lot of medical help, and we’ve done our best to move that medical assistance forward to them in the field.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Jeff.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 Mr. Secretary — right here —\\xa0can you give us an update on numbers you’re seeing about coronavirus cases in Iran, and whether or not you have any updates on the United States helping them with that?\\n\\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\\xa0 So with respect to our assistance to Iran, we’ve offered — from the first day we knew that the virus had struck the people of Iran, we offered humanitarian assistance.\\xa0 I regret that they — they chose not to take that.\\n\\nI’ve heard — I’ve heard people talking about sanctions.\\xa0 There are no — the world should know there are no sanctions that prevent humanitarian assistance, medical supplies, pharmaceuticals from going to Iran.\\xa0 We offered American assistance.\\xa0 We’ve tried to help other countries get assistance in there as well.\\xa0 We’ve some ability to do that.\\n\\nI don’t have any better data than what you’ve seen publicly that I could share with you with respect to the extent of the virus inside of Iran.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\\xa0 Are you allowing exports of medical supplies at this time?\\xa0 Or what’s the status of that?\\n\\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\\xa0 So you’ve seen we’re making sure that we have what we need for the American people, whether that’s gloves — I’ll let the Vice President talk to numbers on that.\\xa0 But at this point, what we are doing in terms of assistance is providing what most of these countries need to learn how to do surveillance themselves, to learn how to conduct tests themselves, to learn the things that can reduce the peak in their countries.\\xa0 Those are the kinds of things.\\n\\nAnd we’ve been doing this.\\xa0 You should know the United States has been incredibly generous.\\xa0 We have CDC officials, like no other country in the world, out helping these nations build out their healthcare — global epidemic healthcare infrastructure.\\xa0 It’s good people like — that you see sitting to my right.\\xa0 They’ve been working on this all their life, all around the world, putting these countries in a place where they’re better prepared for a virus like this one.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have any U.S. diplomats or U.S. officials contracted the virus as they have tried to rescue U.S. citizens abroad?\\n\\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\\xa0 Not that I’m aware of.\\xa0 Not that I’m aware.\\xa0 But it’s — there’s no doubt — I remember when we sent our team to get our officials and about 800 American citizens — non-government citizens — that were living in Wuhan.\\xa0 I remember when we sent one of our first repatriation flights in there.\\xa0 We were very careful.\\xa0 We sent trained professionals in, but they were going into a very, very difficult, very fraught place.\\xa0 We were blessed they all got back with no one having contracted the virus on that trip.\\n\\nI’m not aware of any of our officials that have had the virus attack them while they were performing their functions, trying to get people back.\\xa0 We have a number of State Department officials who have — who have COVID-19 now and are working their way through.\\xa0 In fact, we’ve had three fatalities of local employees — not U.S. direct hires, but local people who were working for the State Department and embassies around the world.\\xa0 We’ve had three fatalities, so far.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, there have been some calls on the World Health Organization for a leadership change there.\\xa0 I was wondering what your thoughts are on that.\\xa0 Senator Martha McSally, for example, has called for Dr. Tedros to resign.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Haven’t made a determination.\\n\\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\\xa0 I don’t want to — look, this is not the time to be to be doing that kind of change.\\xa0 There’ll be a lot of time to look back and see how the World Health Organization performed.\\n\\nIn the meantime, what our task is, is to preserve and protect the American taxpayers, to make sure that our resources don’t go to places that aren’t going to deliver on behalf of the American people in the world.\\xa0 And President Trump and I are determined to do that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just a quick follow-up?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Let’s save it.\\xa0 Can we save it?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just a quick follow-up, sir, if I may, on China.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 (Inaudible) busy man.\\xa0 He’s a busy man.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You said that China has a responsibility to get correct figures.\\xa0 How would you broadly characterize cooperation with China right now?\\n\\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\\xa0 There’s lots of places we’ve been cooperating, right?\\xa0 They’re providing us assistance where we need it.\\xa0 There are places on the ground now where we do have access to the data we need, and we’re deeply appreciative of that.\\n\\nThey’ve said they want to cooperate.\\xa0 We’re completely prepared to cooperate with them.\\xa0 That cooperation means sharing data, being transparent, being upfront, allowing information to flow freely.\\xa0 That’s our expectation, not — not just of China, though — of every country that is in this place today.\\n\\nWe — collectively, we have to work our way through this, and to do that, you have to have really good data.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 Thank you, Mike.\\n\\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\\xa0 Great.\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Thank you all.\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Appreciate it.\\xa0 Thanks.\\xa0 Okay, thank you very much.\\n\\nIn just a few days, we’ve delivered nearly 11 million N95 masks to hotspots around the country, as you know, including 6.6 million to New York and New Jersey, 1.8 million to Chicago, 1.7 million to Detroit, and 837,000 to New Orleans.\\n\\nI spoke with the governor of Louisiana a little while ago, and they’re doing, really, pretty well.\\xa0 Much better than they thought.\\xa0 They’ll be using fewer beds.\\xa0 As you know, we built a hospital.\\xa0 We’re about set to complete another hospital, and there’s even a possibility they won’t — they won’t need it. That’s what we discussed.\\n\\nTo date, we’ve shipped out more than 8,000 ventilators, and we have 10,000 — almost 10,000 sitting.\\xa0 They are ready to go, should we need them.\\xa0 And an additional 2,200 newly manufactured ventilators come online on Monday.\\xa0 We’re going to be sending them to various locations, just in case they need them.\\n\\nMy administration is working with Philips to double their production of ventilators by May, and ultimately quadruple production by later this year.\\xa0 High-quality ventilators.\\xa0 We’re eliminating bureaucratic barriers to pave the way for Philips’s major investments in American manufacturing sites and sales.\\n\\nThis will help to ensure that our country can permanently produce enough ventilators in the future that we can do them by ourselves.\\xa0 We’re going to have a big stockpile when we’re finished.\\xa0 And we expect to be sending quite a few to other countries to help them after we’re finished.\\xa0 And even now, we’re — a couple of countries are really, really in dire need.\\xa0 And it looks like our projections were right on ventilators, and some states that were thinking they would need thousands of more than they thought will — are now already taken care of, which we’re very happy about.\\n\\nIn addition, beginning in May, we’ll be receiving almost 300 million new face masks.\\xa0 We’re going to have masks of about 300 million; they’ll be starting to be delivered in May and during the month of June.\\xa0 So we’re ordering a big stockpile, and we’re thinking about doing an extra 200 million should we need them, or for the — or for the stockpile.\\xa0 So we’ll be in a position to have something incredible.\\xa0 It’ll be a total of 500 million masks.\\n\\nAnd today, 750,000 new protective gowns landed in Dallas, Texas, as a result of a partnership led by the federal government, DuPont, and FedEx.\\xa0 And that’s been a great partnership.\\xa0 That’s worked very well.\\xa0 So we have 600 and — and we have 750,000 new protective gowns.\\xa0 And these are at a high level — very high quality.\\n\\nAs American industry steps up to help, so are America’s doctors and scientists.\\xa0 Ten drugs are now in clinical trials.\\xa0 And my administration is taking unprecedented actions to make new therapies and treatments available without delay.\\xa0 The doctors, the lab technicians, the companies — I spoke to them yesterday; I spoke again today.\\xa0 They are coming up with things that are, I think, I hope — in the very near future — are going to be very, very special, very important.\\n\\nOur National Stockpile is now equipped with nearly 30 million hydroxychloroquine pills.\\xa0 So we’re up to about 30 million.\\xa0 We’re distributing by the millions.\\n\\nYou read about State Representative Karen Whitsett, who I very much appreciate her going public.\\xa0 But she was, I think, very, very much helped by this pill.\\xa0 She saw what I was saying on television.\\xa0 She thought she was in very bad shape.\\xa0 I don’t want to go further than that, but you see her story; you know her story.\\xa0 She’s a highly respected state rep from Michigan.\\xa0 And she did a — she did a — I think she did a great service, what she — what she’s done.\\xa0 She’s in terrific shape.\\xa0 She looks fantastic.\\xa0 And she was very generous with her statements.\\n\\nIn addition, the azithromycin and zinc — they say zinc — you should add zinc.\\xa0 Now, it’s all — has to be recommended by doctors, physicians.\\xa0 But they say zinc.\\xa0 I want to throw that out there because that’s where they seem to be having the best result.\\xa0 So you add the zinc and the azithromycin.\\n\\nAnd it’s been — we’ve had a lot of good stories.\\xa0 A lot of good stories.\\xa0 And we have almost 30 million doses.\\xa0 So we’ve got a lot.\\xa0 I want to thank Prime Minister Modi of India for allowing us to have what we requested from before the problem arose.\\xa0 And he was — he was terrific.\\xa0 We’ll remember it.\\n\\nLater today, the CDC will release further guidance to help ensure critical infrastructure workers can perform their job safely after potential exposure to the virus.\\xa0 And so they’re working on that.\\n\\nThe question was asked a little while ago about the World Health Organization.\\xa0 And, as you know, they made a statement on June — on January 14th, I guess it was, that there was no human-to-human transmission.\\xa0 Well, there was.\\xa0 They probably made that statement in the second or third week of December, in addition, but they made it very powerfully on January 14th.\\xa0 And they criticized me very strongly when I said that we’re going to shut down flights coming in from China, and especially from certain parts of China, but from China generally.\\xa0 We were criticized very badly.\\n\\nSo, last year, and for many years, hundreds of millions of dollars has been paid to the World Health Organization.\\xa0 Hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\\xa0 And last year, it was $452 million, and China paid $42 million.\\xa0 Before that, it was $500 million, and China paid less than $40 million.\\xa0 And before that, it was similar numbers — in the 400s, 300s, and sometimes even in the 500s of millions of dollars.\\xa0 And China would do proportionately just a small fraction of that number.\\n\\nAnd I think they have to get their priorities right, and their priorities are that everybody has to be treated properly — every country.\\xa0 And it doesn’t seem that way, does it?\\xa0 It doesn’t seem that way.\\n\\nSo we’re going to do — study, investigation, and we’re going to make a determination as to what we’re doing.\\xa0 In the meantime, we’re holding back.\\xa0 We’re going to — we want to see.\\xa0 It’s very unfair.\\n\\nSo the United States — $452 million compared to $42 million.\\xa0 That’s to the World Health Organization.\\xa0 That’s not good.\\xa0 That’s not good.\\xa0 Not fair.\\xa0 Not fair at all.\\xa0 And other countries, as you know, also gave very substantially less than the United States.\\n\\nAnd the World — WHO — World Health got it wrong.\\xa0 I mean, they got it very wrong.\\xa0 In many ways, they were wrong.\\xa0 They also minimized the threat very strongly and — not good.\\n\\nI want to take this opportunity to express the thanks of an extremely grateful nation to the Americans who go to work every day, especially in these critical industries, in the midst of the pandemic to care for and protect and feed American people, including medical personnel, law enforcement, first responders, food suppliers, sanitation workers.\\n\\nAnd somebody mentioned today, “Would you please specifically call out cashiers and clerks at grocery stores who are in danger during the — during the pandemic, during the epidemic?”\\xa0 They’re in danger.\\xa0 They’re really in great danger.\\xa0 And they’ve been incredible and I want to call them out — to cashiers and clerks.\\xa0 We grew up with cashiers and clerks and grocery stores and they’ve been great and they’ve really been true American heroes, so I want to call them out because they’re working hard and they’re working in conditions that aren’t ideal.\\xa0 But soon they’ll be ideal again.\\n\\nAs we mourn the terrible loss of life for this — and from this — this grave pandemic, we’re seeing signs that our aggressive strategy to slow the spread is working.\\xa0 The number of new cases is stabilizing.\\xa0 The number of beds necessary in so many locations — I was watching, this morning, New York.\\xa0 I was watching Louisiana.\\xa0 You see what’s going on.\\xa0 The numbers are changing and they’re changing rapidly.\\xa0 And soon we’ll be over that curve.\\xa0 We’ll be over the top and we’ll be headed in the right direction.\\xa0 I feel strongly about that.\\n\\nSome terrible days ahead, but we’re going to have some — some wonderful days ahead.\\xa0 And we’re going to get this behind us, this terrible thing behind us.\\xa0 Some people will never be able to forget if they had a loved one or if they had a great friend or a friend — but we’re going to get it behind us.\\n\\nThis is a tribute to the discipline and the devotion of the American people, what we’ve accomplished.\\xa0 If every American continues to strictly adhere to social distancing guidelines, we can defeat the invisible enemy and save countless lives and we can do it much more quickly.\\n\\nWe’re hopefully heading toward a final stretch — the light at the end of the tunnel, as I was saying.\\xa0 As we continue to wage all-out medical war to defeat the virus, we’re also fighting an economic war to ensure we can quickly turn to full financial strength.\\xa0 We have to get our country back.\\xa0 We have to get going.\\xa0 Everybody wants to get going.\\n\\nYesterday, I asked Congress to provide an additional $250 billion to expand the incredibly successful Paycheck Protection Program — you’ve seen what’s gone on there; it’s incredible, actually — which is allowing our small businesses to keep employees on the payroll and get ready for the opening.\\xa0 Like a second opening.\\n\\nTo protect millions of American jobs, I’m asking Congress to pass additional funding for this program this week, as soon as possible.\\xa0 And I think we have a pretty good understanding with the Democrats.\\xa0 Hopefully, it’s going to be bipartisan.\\xa0 We do not have time for the partisan games and we don’t want that — the obstruction or totally unrelated agendas.\\xa0 We want to do this for the small businesses and the workers.\\xa0 And we can do a phase four and phase four will be later.\\n\\nThis will be an expansion of what we’ve already done because it’s so successful.\\xa0 The $350 billion will be expanded by hopefully 250 and, if you look at the kind of loans, thousands — tens of thousands of loans to small businesses.\\xa0 It’s a — it’s a great thing to see.\\xa0 It’s turned out to be more successful and more productive than anybody would have thought.\\xa0 But Democrats or Republicans are coming together to get that job done.\\xa0 That’s a very important job.\\n\\nIn recent days and days ahead, we’ll restore America’s health and economic might, but also dimensions of our national strength will be brought together, I think, stronger than — I think we have a chance to be stronger than ever before.\\xa0 We’ve learned a lot and we have tremendous stimulus now.\\xa0 Tremendous stimulus.\\xa0 And we’re going for more.\\xa0 Hopefully, we’ll be doing an infrastructure bill so we can rebuild our roads and highways and bridges and tunnels and all of the things that we should be doing for our country.\\xa0 We’re going to rebuild our country, not other countries where they don’t even appreciate it.\\n\\nAs our citizens persevere through this present challenge, we’re renewing American unity and we’re replenishing American will and we are witnessing new American valor each and every day.\\xa0 We see it every day.\\xa0 The daring and determination of our people in this crisis reminds us that no matter how hard it gets, no matter what obstacles we must overcome, Americans will keep on fighting to victory and we will secure the glorious future that our citizens so richly deserve, especially after going through this nightmare, this evil beast.\\n\\nSo we’re getting very close and hopefully it will — hopefully, it’s on the other side and it will end soon.\\xa0 And I think it will.\\xa0 And I just think that the people of this country are fantastic.\\n\\nSo we’ll take a few questions and then Vice President will take over.\\n\\nPlease go ahead.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you so much, Mr. President.\\xa0 ABC is reporting that your intellig- — intelligence community was warning about the virus as early as November and produced a detailed report about the outbreak in China.\\xa0 When did you first learn about the intelligence?\\xa0 And could you have acted on it then?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I learned when I started — when I learned about the gravity of it was sometime just prior to closing the country to China.\\xa0 And when we closed up the flights coming in from China and various other elements — and then, as you know, we closed up to Europe.\\n\\nSo, I don’t know exactly, but I’d like to see the information.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, a lot of Americans want to see businesses reopen, to get back to work.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 So do I, more than anybody.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So what specifically has to happen for you to feel that it is safe to reopen the country?\\xa0 And what is your plan to do that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think we can say that we have to be on that down side of that slope and heading to a very strong direction that this thing is gone.\\xa0 We could do it in phases.\\xa0 We can go to some areas, which you know.\\xa0 Some areas are much less affected than others.\\n\\nBut it would be nice to be able to open with a big bang and open up our country — or certainly most of our country.\\xa0 And I think we’re going to do that soon.\\xa0 If you look at what’s happening, I would say we’re ahead of schedule.\\n\\nNow, you hate to say it too loudly because, all of the sudden, things don’t happen.\\xa0 But I think we will be sooner rather than later.\\xa0 But we’ll be sitting down with the professionals.\\xa0 We’ll be sitting down with many different people and making a determination.\\xa0 And those meetings will start taking place fairly soon.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you wouldn’t do that until the health experts tell you it’s safe to do it?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I would — I rely very heavily on them.\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you think — is there a system for monitoring and testing that you’re looking at that will lead that to be safe?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 We’re putting in — yeah.\\xa0 We’re putting in very heavy testing systems.\\xa0 We have the best testing systems.\\n\\nAnd again, don’t forget when we look at cases, I’m looking at some — I’m not going to insult anybody, I’m not going to insult any country — but I’m looking at countries that are showing less cases than us; that’s testing.\\xa0 We’re testing more than anybody.\\xa0 And you — you saw exponentially, more than anybody, by far.\\xa0 And our testing has become — I think it’ll end up being a big strength.\\xa0 In fact, the other countries — other countries that the media talked about are now calling us for what are we doing and how are we doing it so quickly and where are we getting these tests because our tests are really good now.\\xa0 They’ve been proven to be very accurate.\\n\\nYes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, President Trump.\\xa0 Two quick questions.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 One on infrastructure.\\xa0 Members of your administration and members of Congress have pointed out that the top paid federal employee, it’s not the President, it’s the head of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and he made $8 million last year and some —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s ridiculous.\\xa0 I agree.\\xa0 It’s ridiculous.\\xa0 I think it’s the highest-paid government — long before I got here — you said Tennessee Valley Authority, right?\\xa0 Has to be the highest-paid man in any government; makes approximately $8 or $9 million.\\xa0 I don’t know the gentleman but he’s got a heck of a job.\\xa0 He gets paid a lot of money.\\xa0 He’s been there for a long while, hasn’t he?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This one actually is new.\\xa0 He came in April.\\xa0 But the previous one was —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, that’s a separate — yeah, that’s separate.\\xa0 But I’m talking about the — the — we just have some new people going on the board, I know.\\n\\nBut as you know, that’s a quasi-public agency.\\xa0 And whoever the head of the agency is, that person makes a lot of money —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And if I could ask my second question —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — which is an amazing thing, right?\\xa0 And when we want them to do something, they’re not there for us.\\xa0 That’s not good.\\xa0 That’s not good.\\xa0 They’ve been there for a long time.\\xa0 That’s been a story for a long time.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And I assume that you would support reducing that salary as part of the infrastructure bill?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Reducing it by a lot.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 And my other question is —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That would be the greatest job in the history of government, almost.\\xa0 Certainly if you’re into money.\\xa0 Tennessee Valley Authority.\\xa0 That’s right.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’ve been waiting for somebody to ask me about that.\\xa0 It’s been — it’s been bothering me for a long time too.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So one of the biggest rating hits of the coronavirus, aside from these briefings, has been a show on Netflix called “Tiger King.”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And the man who’s the star of this is a former zoo owner who’s serving a 22-year prison sentence.\\xa0 He’s asking you for a pardon, saying he was unfairly convicted.\\xa0 Your son yesterday jokingly said that, you know, he was going to advocate for it.\\xa0 And I was wondering if you’ve seen the show and if you have any thoughts on pardoning Joe Exotic.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Which son?\\xa0 It must be Don.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It was.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I had a feeling it was Don.\\xa0 Is that what he said?\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 I know nothing about it.\\xa0 He has 22 years for what?\\xa0 What did he do?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 He allegedly hired someone to murder an animal rights activist.\\xa0 But he said that he didn’t do that.\\xa0 And he was —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You think he didn’t do it?\\xa0 Are you on his side?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, I’m a reporter.\\xa0 I shouldn’t take sides.\\xa0 But —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Are you recommending a pardon?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No.\\xa0 I’m not advocating anything yet.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 As a reporter, you’re not allowed to do that.\\xa0 You’d be criticized by these — would you recommend a pardon?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m not weighing in on “Tiger King,” Mr. President.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t think you would.\\xa0 I don’t think you would.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 Do you have a question?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I do like Joe Exotic, I will say.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’ll take a look.\\xa0 Is that Joe Exotic?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s Joe Exotic?\\xa0 (Laughs.)\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Let me get back to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — the coronavirus if I can, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Last week, your top experts were saying that we should expect 100,000 to 240,000 deaths in this country.\\xa0 You’ve been talking about how it looks like maybe things are plateauing.\\xa0 Are these numbers now being revised downward?\\xa0 I know you don’t want people to stop social distancing and that sort of thing, but what can you tell us about the numbers?\\xa0 Are they being revised down?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 My — yeah.\\xa0 My impression, Jim, is those were the numbers that were set, and they were set as an expectation from quite a while ago.\\xa0 I think we’re just doing much better than those numbers.\\n\\nIf either of you would like to talk about that, it’s a fair question.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Deborah?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Do you want to come up?\\xa0 Deborah?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I know Dr. Redfield said something about it too.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yeah, so, I think all of you — many of you have done the analysis of the same models that we utilized.\\xa0 And if you do the models of the models, you end up with that range.\\xa0 At the same time, we’ve carefully looked at Italy and Spain.\\xa0 And we are doing much better, in many cases, than several other countries.\\xa0 And we’re trying to understand that.\\n\\nWe believe that our healthcare delivery system in the United States is quite extraordinary.\\xa0 I know many of you are watching the Act Now model and the IHME model from — and they have consistently decreased the number, the mortality from over almost 90,000 or 86,000, down to 81,000 and now down to 61,000.\\xa0 That is modeled on what America is doing.\\xa0 That’s what’s happening.\\n\\nAnd I think what has been so remarkable, I think to those of us who have been in the science fields for so long, is how important behavioral change is and how amazing Americans are in adapting to and following through on these behavioral changes.\\xa0 And that’s what’s changing the rate of new cases, and that’s what will change the mortality going forward, because now we’re into the time period of full mitigation that should be reflected within the coming weeks of decreasing mortality.\\xa0 I mean, that’s what we really hope to see.\\n\\nWe are impressed by the American people.\\xa0 And I think models are models.\\xa0 I’ve always worked on validating.\\xa0 I’ve spent my life validating models all over the world, and that’s why we do surveys and surveillance and we make sure that what we think is right is right.\\n\\nI think this will change how people look at respiratory diseases because it will change what is possible when the globe, and particularly the American people, do this level of mitigation.\\xa0 I think, as I talked about yesterday, we are still — we are still in awe, really, of the American people’s strength in this and following through.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And if I could just ask, Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 I’m going to do that.\\xa0 I’m going to ask Bob to come up just for a second.\\xa0 Director —\\n\\nI think that’s it: We have a — we’ve done, they have done, everybody has done — everybody, a great job.\\xa0 So those were original projections.\\xa0 And we don’t want to say anything about beating it yet, but I think we will have a very good chance to beat them very substantially.\\n\\nBob, please?\\n\\nDR. REDFIELD:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 And I just want to add to what Ambassador Birx said.\\xa0 I mean, this is a consequence of the commitment of the American people.\\xa0 You know, a lot of us have always had challenges of changing behavior, whether it’s exercising regularly or different habits with smoking, when it — when it affects us.\\n\\nWhat’s been remarkable to watch here is how the American public has changed their behavior when it protects the vulnerable.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s right.\\n\\nDR. REDFIELD:\\xa0 I think that’s really what I’m so proud to see.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s well said.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And, Mr. President, just a follow-up on something from yesterday, and a quick just yes or no question.\\xa0 Yesterday, you said you had not seen Peter Navarro’s memo on the coronavirus back in January and February 23rd.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Were you ever briefed on those memos?\\xa0 Did you ever discuss those memos with anybody on your —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t remember that.\\xa0 I’ve now seen the memo.\\xa0 I saw it.\\xa0 It was — Peter sends a lot of memos.\\xa0 I didn’t see the memo.\\xa0 As you know, World Health was saying that was not correct because, at the time, they called it wrong.\\n\\nBut I didn’t see the memo.\\xa0 But I acted as quickly as — people were shocked that I acted so quickly.\\xa0 And everybody thought I was wrong because I did act so quickly as you know, with respect to closing the borders — with respect not only to China, but with Europe I closed the borders.\\xa0 And I think that was very important.\\n\\nBut, no, I didn’t see the memo at the time.\\xa0 But I have seen it since.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 One other quick question —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Wait a minute, Jim.\\xa0 Let me — let me do a couple of others.\\xa0 We’ll go back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The head of the World Health Organization today warned against politicizing —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I agree with that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And he said that the consequence of this politicization could actually create “more body bags.”\\xa0 It’s a pretty vivid image.\\xa0 What — what do you believe the consequences of the U.S. pulling out its funding of the WHO would actually be (inaudible) like this?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think when you say more body bags, I think we would have done — and he would have been much better serving the people that he’s supposed to serve if they gave a correct analysis.\\xa0 I mean, everything was, I said, China-centric: “Everything was going to be fine.\\xa0 No human to human.\\xa0 Keep the borders open.”\\xa0 He wanted me to keep the borders open.\\xa0 I closed the borders despite him, and that was a hard decision to make at the time.\\n\\nWe were all together, and we made a decision against the World Health Organization.\\xa0 So when he says “politicizing,” he’s politicizing.\\xa0 That shouldn’t be.\\n\\nBut, look, we spent $450 billion, $452 billion.\\xa0 Almost $500 billion last year.\\xa0 Hundreds of billions in previous years.\\xa0 And they got to do better than that.\\xa0 They got to do better.\\xa0 When you talk about politics, I can’t believe — he’s talking about politics when look at the relationship they have to China.\\n\\nSo China spends $42 million, we spend $450 million, and everything seems to be China’s way.\\xa0 That’s not right.\\xa0 It’s not fair to us, and honestly, it’s not fair to the world.\\n\\nOkay.\\xa0 Question in the back.\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 There’s breaking news today in a couple of reports from a couple different outlets that Jared Kushner’s team is seeking to create a national coronavirus database, a tracking system for patients who’ve been diagnosed.\\xa0 Now, his spokesperson said that that’s not true.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 It’s not —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s not true?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I have never heard about it.\\xa0 Doesn’t sound like a bad idea, actually.\\xa0 But I have not heard about that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you would be okay with it if were?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know if I’d be okay.\\xa0 I have to see it.\\xa0 But it sounds very scientific, and it sounds like it could be good, based on tracking.\\xa0 But it also has to do with rights and lots of different constitutional questions.\\xa0 I have not heard that at all.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 So some people are concerned it would be like the post-9/11 PATRIOT Act, that it ultimately led to FISA abuse.\\xa0 Are there any — are you concerned about that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah — the FISA abuse, of which I was the one abused.\\xa0 And a couple of other people, in all fairness.\\n\\nNo, I don’t know anything about it.\\xa0 I haven’t heard it.\\xa0 I mean, I’ll speak to him.\\xa0 I don’t — I don’t think so.\\xa0 They would have told me.\\xa0 I would have known about it.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 The Nevada delegation is unhappy because smaller casinos and businesses that make a profit —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 In Nevada?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — from gaming — in Nevada — found out they’re not eligible for the CARES Act PPP money.\\xa0 Is this — and I talked to one member who said gaming —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You mean because of the number of employees?\\n\\nQ\\xa0 Because of the number of employees —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And yet they’re small businesses.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And they thought gaming would be — would not be treated any differently than any other business with this.\\xa0 Was this an oversight?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I can look at that.\\xa0 I could look.\\xa0 It’s a great state, and I will take a look at that strongly.\\xa0 Are you talking only the smaller casinos?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 That’s —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 I’ll take a look at that.\\xa0 Fine.\\xa0 I don’t mind that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is the first you’ve heard about it?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 We’ll take a look.\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 We haven’t heard.\\xa0 Nobody has told me about it, but I’ll look at it.\\n\\nThey — they — it’s a great state. They do a great job.\\xa0 So I’m going to look at it very strongly.\\xa0 I understand what they mean.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Turning to the economy, what if you urge Americans to go back to work and they don’t listen to you?\\xa0 Would you leave that up to the governors, to businesses, to citizens to decide when it’s safe to stop social distancing?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, when you say they don’t listen, I think they’re going to listen.\\xa0 They want to go back.\\xa0 Everybody wants.\\xa0 They’re going stir crazy.\\xa0 They have been in those houses and those apartments and their buildings.\\xa0 I mean, they’ve really been — they have done a great job.\\n\\nAgain, when you look — the question was just asked about — you know, about how we’re doing compared to projections.\\xa0 Those were just original projections, the big projection being 2.2 million people would die if we did nothing.\\xa0 That was another decision we made: Close it up.\\xa0 That was a big decision that we made.\\n\\nTwo very smart people walked into my office, and they said, “Listen, these are your alternatives.”\\xa0 And that was a projection of, I guess, 1.5- to 2.2 million people would die if we didn’t close it up.\\xa0 That’s a lot of people.\\xa0 So, if we do a number that’s tremendously smaller than that — now, if we did close it up, the numbers got to 100- to 220 million people.\\n\\nSo, if we can stay substantially under the 100, which was the original projection, I think we all did a very good job, even though it’s a lot of people.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you think that’ll happen by May 1st?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Say it?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0 Do you think we will be on track for that by May 1st?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, right now, we’re — I mean, we’re doing well in terms of the numbers.\\xa0 I can’t tell you in terms of the date.\\xa0 You know, we don’t want to — we don’t want to go down, and then we can start going up, if we’re not careful.\\xa0 So, we have to be careful.\\n\\nAs far as distancing — social distancing and other things — certainly for a while.\\xa0 You know, at some point, that’s going away.\\xa0 We’ll be able to sit next to each other and every — like we have all our lives.\\xa0 This is a very unique thing.\\xa0 This has not happened, anything like this, of this magnitude, since 1917, 1918, the great pandemic.\\xa0 That was — that was something.\\n\\nBut — yeah, no, people want to sit next to each other at restaurants.\\xa0 They want to sit next to each other like normal at a football game, baseball game, basketball game, hockey game.\\xa0 No, we want to go back to life.\\n\\nNow, the first period of time, maybe we’ll go a little bit slower and maybe we’ll be talking about distancing.\\xa0 But at some point, we expect to be back like it was before.\\xa0 And hopefully it’ll never happen.\\xa0 Hopefully it will — if it does happen it’s going to be in a hundred years from now.\\xa0 The last one, 1917 — that’s something.\\xa0 That’s a long time ago.\\xa0 And that was — that was a horrible thing.\\n\\nJim, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, I wanted to get back to something you were saying yesterday about people going to Wisconsin and voting —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — in the middle of this pandemic, really putting their lives on a line.\\xa0 And you said: Well, if they do that, vote by mail, perhaps we’ll have voter fraud in this country.\\n\\nAnd I just wanted to ask you, voters in five states — Utah, Colorado, Hawaii, Washington, and Oregon — all vote by mail.\\xa0 Can you or the White House staff or your campaign provide any evidence to back up your claim that mail-in voting is rife with fraud, like the example you gave of people working in rooms, filling out false ballots?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, sure.\\xa0 Well, what happened —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You’ve been talking about voter fraud —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, what happened — yeah.\\xa0 True.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — since the beginning of this administration.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 True and fair.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And where is the evidence of it?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The — I think there’s a lot of evidence, but we’ll provide you with some, okay?\\xa0 And there’s evidence that’s being compiled just like it’s being compiled in the state of California, where they settled with Judicial Watch, saying that a million people should not have been voting in — you saw that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But all the experts say voter fraud is rare.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Wait, excuse me.\\xa0 I’m just telling you.\\xa0 I’m telling you, in California, in the great state of California, they settled, and we could’ve gone a lot further.\\xa0 Judicial Watch settled where they agreed that a million people should not have voted, where they were 115 years old and lots of things, and people were voting in their place.\\n\\nWhat I see and — you know, every one of those states that you mentioned is a state that happens to be won by the Democrats.\\xa0 And if you have a position like me, where it’s registered, you’re here, and we’re voting someplace where I’m not — I haven’t left the White House in, I guess, months, other than to, you know, ask a ship to — you know, wave it goodbye to New York — which, by the way, is now going — as you know, being used for the purpose that we’re talking about, which a lot of people wanted.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you tweeted mail-in voting —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Wait a minute.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — “doesn’t work out well for the Republicans.”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well it’s — it hasn’t.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So isn’t your —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It certainly hasn’t.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Isn’t your concern really just political?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But if you’re a senior citizen and if you’re somebody that needs it, I’m all for it.\\xa0 But they have to be very careful, because you know the things with bundling and all of the things that are happening with votes by mail where thousands of votes are gathered.\\xa0 And I’m not going to say which party does it, but thousands of votes are gathered and they come in and they’re dumped in a location, and then, all of a sudden, you lose elections if you think you’re going to win.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But where is the proof that that’s happened?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I won’t to stand for it.\\xa0 Well, we’re going to find out about the proof, because you’re going to see what’s going on.\\xa0 And I’m not going to stand for it.\\xa0 Our voting system — first of all, we should have voter ID.\\xa0 When you vote, you should have voter ID.\\xa0 And if you send something in, you should be sure — as a state and as a country, you should be sure that that vote is meaningful and it’s not just made fraudulently, because there’s a lot of fraudulent voting going on in this country.\\xa0 This country should have voter ID.\\n\\nOkay, let’s do another one.\\xa0 Go, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, currently, the only — the only way that we can track these millions of doses of hydroxychloroquine that are being distributed across the country —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — is through the E-Health DataSystem.\\xa0 How systematically is your task force watching this system, understanding it’s early?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think it’s very systematic.\\xa0 Yeah, we’re distributing the hydroxy all through the country.\\xa0 It’s being distributed in large amounts.\\xa0 We have it coming in now.\\xa0 We’re up to 29 million doses; then we went to 30 million doses.\\xa0 But we have it coming in all throughout the country, and much of it’s being distributed.\\xa0 In fact, it’ll start going down, what we have in our stockpile.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But the only (inaudible).\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And, again, it’s had — you know, I — I hope it works.\\xa0 Again, I’m not a doctor, as you possibly have found out.\\xa0 I’m not a doctor, but I’m a person with common sense.\\n\\nAnd we’ve had some very good results over the course —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Through the E-Health DataSystem?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — including a woman who just reported it two days ago.\\n\\nYes?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Through the E-Health DataSystem, are they — is that operating —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think no.\\xa0 We’re looking — we’re looking to provide it in many different ways.\\xa0 In many ways, we’re — in certain instances, we’ve been asked — in the case of Michigan, we’ve been asked who the governor of Michigan would like to — I think she’s become a big fan of it as a medication,\\xa0as a — as something that’s going to help with this horrible virus.\\xa0 And we’re delivering it to the governments of various states when they ask.\\xa0 So certain states are asking, certain governments are asking, and we’re delivering it directly to the government.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you very much, Mr. President.\\xa0 We know many people around the world are paying close attention to this press conference.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So on behalf of —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good.\\xa0 Where are you from?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — Foreign Media —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Where are you from?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m from Taiwan.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 On behalf of Foreign Media Group, I would like to ask you two questions.\\xa0 First question is that the French President Macron called Iranian President Rouhani and say the euro has started to shift the medical goods to Iran.\\xa0 Would you consider —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Medical goods?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That doesn’t bother me.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, so will you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, if they’re sending medical goods to Iran, it doesn’t bother me.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, so the other question is that the world is also paying attention to the U.S. election.\\xa0 So we are also — we know that Bernie Sanders has dropped out today.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I did see that today.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, he didn’t really drop out.\\xa0 He didn’t really — what about his delegates?\\xa0 I mean, he — he said he’s going to keep his delegates and — which is sort of interesting.\\xa0 He’s going to keep his delegates, and he’d like to get more now.\\n\\nNow, is he dropping out or not?\\xa0 That’s not dropping out.\\xa0 When you keep your delegates and then you want more delegates before you get to the convention, that’s a weird deal going on there.\\xa0 I don’t know what’s happening.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So what’s —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And I don’t know why President Obama hasn’t supported Joe Biden a long time ago.\\xa0 There is something he feels is wrong.\\xa0 Why isn’t — he’ll come out.\\xa0 I’m sure he’s got to come out at some point because he certainly doesn’t want to see me for four more years.\\xa0 We’re not — we think a little bit differently.\\n\\nYou know what?\\xa0 I’ll tell you, it does amaze me that President Obama hasn’t supported Sleepy Joe.\\xa0 It just hasn’t happened.\\xa0 When is it going to happen?\\xa0 When is it going to happen?\\xa0 Why isn’t he?\\xa0 He knows something that you don’t know, that I think I know, but you don’t know.\\xa0 So it’ll be interesting.\\n\\nBut with Bernie, I saw his standard fare today.\\xa0 I watched.\\xa0 And I hope that a lot of Bernie Sanders’s people, just like they did last time — we got a tremendous percentage of Bernie people.\\xa0 And I think they voted for me largely because of trade, because Bernie and I agree on trade.\\xa0 We agree that the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country they do business with.\\xa0 The difference is I’ve done a lot about it, and I’m doing more about it.\\xa0 And we’ve made incredible trade deals, including USMCA, the deal with China, and then, all of a sudden, that gets disturbed by this virus situation.\\n\\nBut China has to spend almost $250 billion on purchasing our products, $40- to $50 billion with our farmers.\\xa0 And the Bernie Sanders people are big believers on what I’m saying on trade.\\xa0 And I got a lot of them in the last election.\\xa0 That surprised people, but it didn’t surprise me.\\n\\nNo, those are great people.\\xa0 They’re great people.\\xa0 But I — I just — look, I’m looking at Bernie Sanders.\\xa0 I watched this morning, and I said, “What is that all about?”\\xa0 Like, you saw that — the delegates.\\xa0 The delegates.\\xa0 He’s not giving up his delegates.\\xa0 He’s keeping them, and he said he wants to get more of them.\\xa0 And I think he’s doing it to negotiate, I assume.\\xa0 But I don’t know, that’s — that’s a hard thing to do.\\n\\nYeah, Jeff, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, OPEC is meeting with Russia tomorrow and some other countries to discuss oil prices.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Oil prices are at $23 a barrel.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, that’s good.\\xa0 Finally —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — somebody knows something when they ask a question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What is your message to them ahead of their meeting tomorrow?\\xa0 Will the U.S. consider a coordinated cut of production here?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t think.\\xa0 Look, we already cut.\\xa0 You know, we’re, like, very market-oriented.\\xa0 If you look at Texas and if you look at North Dakota, and if you look at some of our states that do this very well, they’ve already cut way back.\\xa0 You know, they cut back automatically.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you don’t think it’s necessary?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But in the case of Russia, in the case of Saudi Arabia, they increased production at a time when you didn’t need it, and then they got hit by the virus, which knocked out 40 percent of the market.\\xa0 And now they’re flooded with oil.\\n\\nLook I — I just say this: You have two countries that are getting hurt very badly.\\xa0 Russia is getting hurt, and that’s their primary source.\\xa0 And Saudi Arabia, that’s their –definitely their primary source.\\xa0 And it doesn’t make sense that they flooded the market.\\xa0 For whatever reason, they did that for themselves.\\xa0 It’s a argument that they had.\\xa0 And I think they’ll straighten it out.\\n\\nA lot of progress has been made over the last week, and it’ll be interesting to see what comes out of OPEC tomorrow.\\xa0 But OPEC, obviously — for many years, I used to think OPEC was very unfair.\\xa0 I hated OPEC.\\xa0 You want to know the truth?\\xa0 I hated it, because it was a fix.\\xa0 But somewhere along the line, that broke down and it went the opposite way.\\n\\nAnd we have a tremendously powerful energy industry in this country now.\\xa0 Number one in the world.\\xa0 And I don’t want those jobs being lost.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What will you do — just to follow up to that, sir.\\xa0 What will you do if they don’t end up cutting tomorrow?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’ll see.\\xa0 I mean, I have a lot of options.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Got a lot of good options, Jeff.\\xa0 Beauties.\\xa0 I might like it even more.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Tariffs presumably being one of them?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, you’ll.\\xa0 Let’s see what happens.\\xa0 Hopefully they can make a deal.\\n\\nLet’s go.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Clearly, Americans are getting very anxious to go back to work.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I agree.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You’re sounding optimistic —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Including me.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — yet still very vague.\\xa0 Now that the IMHE [sic] model specifically has been adjusted down to 61,000, when are we going to open back up?\\xa0 Can you give us a better date?\\xa0 Is it going to be April 30th, May 1st?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You said adjusted back down 61,000.\\xa0 What was adjusted back?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The IM — the IMHE [sic] model.\\xa0 The one that originally predicted, like, between 100- and 200,000.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 It’s still a big number, right?\\xa0 Sixty-one.\\xa0 Right?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s a big number.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s a big number.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But can you give us a more specific date?\\xa0 Will it be April 30th, May 1st?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I don’t want to do that.\\xa0 Look, I had a date, and I thought it was a very aspirational day.\\xa0 It’s turning out to be very interesting, because a lot of good things are happening by Easter.\\xa0 But I had a very aspirational date.\\xa0 I didn’t think you could make it.\\xa0 I didn’t say we would do it by Easter, but I said, “Boy, wouldn’t it be great to shoot for Easter”?\\xa0 That would be a great day, a beautiful day, a very important day to a lot of people like me and like some of you in the room.\\xa0 Maybe all of you in the room, frankly.\\n\\nBut Easter is a very important day.\\xa0 So I had — aspirationally, I said, “Let’s see if we can do it at Easter.”\\xa0 You know, but I said it would be very tough.\\xa0 And I was criticized for that, so I don’t like giving dates.\\xa0 And that wasn’t a date, that was just an aspiration.\\xa0 That would have been incredible.\\n\\nBut I don’t think we’re going to be very far behind.\\xa0 And some of these models are looking like Easter is going to be a very important date anyway because of the curve.\\xa0 I mean, it’s hitting the top, and it’s starting to come down.\\xa0 And one person said Easter is looking like a good time.\\xa0 So a good time for that, for heading down.\\xa0 So we’ll see what happens.\\n\\nLook, there’s no reason to do that.\\xa0 We have a lot of good things happening.\\xa0 When I spoke to the governor of Louisiana, he said, “Tony, they need far less beds than they needed.”\\xa0 I said, “Well, good, because we’re building 1,000-room additional.”\\xa0 We built them 1,000 — the beds.\\xa0 And now we’re building another thousand.\\n\\nAnd I said, “Listen, is there a way that we don’t build — I don’t want to build them if they don’t need them.”\\xa0 In New York, the Javits isn’t too heavily used; it’s ready to go — 2,900 beds — plus, we now have the ship set for COVID if they want to use it.\\xa0 And we’re using it for governor Murphy in New Jersey.\\xa0 So we’ll see what happens.\\n\\nBut, you know, the numbers are coming way down.\\xa0 The ventilators, we’re all set.\\xa0 We have a lot to go if we want.\\xa0 But we’re not getting — I’m not getting calls where they need ventilators anymore.\\xa0 So we were right on those ventilators.\\n\\nI’d love to have additional ventilators for some of the countries that are our allies and our friends.\\xa0 And even if they’re not our allies and our friends, you’re saving human lives.\\xa0 But I’d love to see if we had some — I mean, we’re making a lot of ventilators right now.\\xa0 We have a — and they take a while to make, and they’re very expensive and they’re very complex to make. \\xa0But I’d love to be able to help other countries once we’re taken care of.\\n\\nBut I just sent 100 ventilators to Colorado, and that was great.\\xa0 A senator there who is a terrific senator — Cory and — Cory Gardner.\\xa0 And he called me last night.\\xa0 He said, “Could you get 100 ventilators for Colorado?”\\xa0 And we just sent them out, and there’ll be there very shortly.\\n\\nSo — but it looks like we’re in great shape from the bed standpoint.\\xa0 It looks like we’re in great shape from the ventilator standpoint.\\xa0 And you just heard, I ordered 500 million masks — 500 N95s and others — and surgical.\\xa0 But we ordered 500 million masks: 300 and 200.\\xa0 And they’re going to be here very shortly.\\n\\nSo, we’re really in great shape, and we started off with an empty cupboard.\\n\\nSo I’m going to leave the Vice President and his group to handle it.\\xa0 And I will see you probably tomorrow.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You don’t have any investments in hydro — hydroxychloroquine?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I don’t.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I don’t.\\xa0 Thanks.\\xa0 Good question.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You all can come up if you want.\\xa0 It’ll be brief.\\n\\nWell, good evening everyone.\\xa0 And to our fellow Americans out west, good afternoon.\\xa0 We find ourselves in the midst of a very tough week for Americans in areas most impacted by the coronavirus — the New York City area, New Jersey, Louisiana.\\xa0 We continue to focus resources and attention on those areas.\\xa0 And I know that the hearts and prayers of the American people are with — are with all of those communities.\\n\\nBut in the wake of more than 1.9 million tests, we see more than 400,000 Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus, and sadly, we’ve lost more than 14,000.\\xa0 We — we grieve.\\xa0 But as the Good Book says, we do not grieve like those who have no hope.\\n\\nIn this very special week, I know that the faith of millions of Americans is a comfort to them.\\xa0 The President and I spoke to more than 10,000 faith leaders, and we were able to express to them our gratitude for the way that they’re strengthening the communities that they serve.\\n\\nBut we also find hope in the numbers that Dr. Birx will continue to reflect on today.\\xa0 For as Dr. Fauci explained yesterday and in the days before, the losses — as grievous as they are — that we are seeing today are a reflection of people that contracted the coronavirus, in many cases before strong mitigation steps were taken, before the guidelines for American fully took hold.\\n\\nThe cases, however, and the new cases and the hospitalizations are, in fact, a reflection of the results of what the American people are doing.\\xa0 And I want to echo the President’s and Dr. Birx’s statements today about the extraordinary work the American people are doing.\\xa0 Because we continue to see a great progress, low and steady numbers in the states of California and Washington.\\n\\nAnd in the New York metropolitan area, New Jersey, New Orleans metro area, Detroit, in Chicago, and Boston, we continue to see evidence of stabilization that should be an encouragement to every American — an encouragement that we may — may be reaching the point where the impact of the coronavirus is beginning to level off.\\n\\nAnd — but it also should be an encouragement to every American to keep doing what we are all doing: Heed the guidance of your state and local authorities, and for every American, continue to put the White House Coronavirus guidelines for America into effect.\\n\\nAn area of particular concern we were briefed on this morning is the city of Philadelphia.\\xa0 I spoke today to Governor Tom Wolf.\\xa0 And as we begin to see early trend lines in Philadelphia, I assured him that we were going to continue to flow resources and support to that community.\\xa0 But our message to the people of the Philadelphia area is: Now, more than ever, practice the social distancing so that Philadelphia and, to some extent, even Pittsburgh do not have to endure what other communities before them have had to endure.\\n\\nAlso today, at the President’s direction, we hosted a conference call with every Republican member of the House of Representatives and every Democrat member of the House of Representatives.\\xa0 And we expressed our appreciation to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Leader Kevin McCarthy for convening these forums.\\n\\nWe’ve brought together key members of our task force team.\\xa0 The Secretary of the Treasury discussed the progress that we’ve made on Paycheck Protection.\\xa0 He reported to members of Congress that, so far, we’re working with more than 3,600 lenders across the country, and we’ve dispersed more than $98 billion in forgivable loans.\\xa0 Now, these are loans that if small businesses accept this money and use it to keep people on their payroll over the next two months, they’ll be completely forgiven.\\n\\nThe Treasury tonight will be issuing a new FAQ — frequently asked questions — document that will also make it clear that lenders may use their own closing documents for completing loan applications.\\xa0 And that information is available at Treasury.gov and SBA.gov, as well.\\n\\nDr. Birx and Dr. Fauci briefed the members of Congress today on the latest data.\\xa0 They’ll both reflect on that in a moment.\\xa0 We also had Admiral Polowczyk talk about our control tower system, and the extraordinary flow of supplies to critical areas across the country.\\xa0 And we also briefed on the disbursement of resources to local hospitals with Seema Verma and gave them an update on what the Secretary of State spoke about today.\\n\\nIt is remarkable to think: more than 50,000 Americans brought back home, through nearly 500 flights.\\xa0 And we thanked the members of Congress who have worked with the State Department to identify family members and groups that found themselves stranded overseas, and we were grateful for that.\\n\\nIn addition to our interaction with members of Congress today, we spoke with the president of the Henry Ford Hospital, Bob Riney.\\xa0 It is the Henry Ford Hospital that is conducting a clinical trial for hydrochloroquine.\\xa0 He expressed great enthusiasm for the work that they had done.\\xa0 They had a rather overwhelming response to the initial trial, which is beginning this week, with 3,000 people taking the hydrochloroquine or a placebo so they can march [sic] it — match it.\\n\\nBut what the president of the Henry Ford Hospital told me is they’d like to expand the test.\\xa0 I put him in touch with Steve Hahn in the FDA, and we’ll be adding several more clinical trial paths to look at impacts on particular demographic groups, including seniors and minority populations.\\xa0 And more on that in just a moment.\\n\\nIn the category of supplies and support, the President, as of today, has signed 52 major disaster declarations.\\xa0 Vermont was the latest approved.\\xa0 And states have stood up some 27,000 National Guard that are aiding in coronavirus response.\\n\\nOn the critical subject of ventilators, we do have currently more than 8,000 ventilators in our Strategic National Stockpile and distributed more to the Navajo Nation and to Colorado today.\\xa0 But also today, we received the good news that the first delivery of newly manufactured ventilators from General Electric and Hamilton arrived at the Strategic National Stockpile.\\xa0 And as the President said, we’ll be adding newly manufactured ventilators to our resources to be available as the coronavirus epidemic reaches critical communities around the country.\\n\\nOn the subject of the air bridge, four flights were scheduled to arrive today, primarily focused on gloves for our incredible healthcare workers.\\xa0 One flight alone had nearly 19 million gloves — another 8 million, another 15 million, and the like.\\xa0 And the American people, I think, would be very proud to see this vast array of, now, well more than 50 flights that are bringing in supplies from all over the world.\\xa0 And, again, working through FEMA, we’re directing those resources with the guidance of our scientific experts to the communities most in need.\\n\\nAs we announced yesterday, the White House Coronavirus Task Force has requested that CDC and our team assemble data on the unique impact that we’re seeing reported on African Americans from the coronavirus.\\xa0 Dr. Fauci spoke about it yesterday and will reflect on his perspective on that as well.\\n\\nTomorrow, with the Surgeon General and others on the White House team, we’ll be speaking with leaders in the African American community.\\xa0 And, as Dr. Fauci will reflect, there are — have been historic challenges in the healthcare of the African American communities, particularly in our inner cities.\\n\\nAnd now, more than ever, I’ll just say from my heart to all of the — all of our African American family members: Now, more than ever, practice the guidelines.\\xa0 Look after those most vulnerable people that have underlying serious health conditions.\\xa0 It’s more important than ever that we all put those principles into practice.\\n\\nFinally, today, I’m going to have — after we hear from Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx, I’m going to ask Dr. Redfield to step up because today the CDC will be publishing new guidance on essential critical workers who have been exposed to COVID-19 but don’t have any symptoms — who don’t have a temperature and don’t have any reason to believe that they have the coronavirus.\\n\\nAt the present moment, the guidance is that if you have been in proximity to someone who did test positive for the coronavirus that — the guidance of CDC is that, that even with essential critical workers in industries from healthcare to food supply, that we asked people to stay home for 14 days.\\xa0 The new guidance tonight will hopefully make it clear that there would be an opportunity for those people playing such an incredible role in our nation’s response to be able to return to work and to do so safely.\\n\\nAnd finally, let me just say again now how inspired we are at the response of the American people to the coronavirus epidemic.\\xa0 Each and every day, as we see the beginnings of encouraging news — the low and steady numbers in California and Washington State, and now beginning to see numbers of hospitalizations going down and new cases leveling and, in some cases, going down — we all hope it is the beginning of a trend.\\n\\nBut we also hope it is — it’s an encouragement to every American to keep doing what you’re doing, not just for your own health and for the health of your loved ones, but because we want to make sure that all of us are doing our part to make sure that the fewest number of Americans possible are exposed to the coronavirus.\\n\\nAnd given the fact that this, I remind you, is three times more contagious than the flu, each of us has a role to play in slowing the spread.\\xa0 That’s what the “30 Days to Slow the Spread” is all about.\\xa0 It’s about protecting your health.\\xa0 It’s about making sure that that our healthcare workers are — and our healthcare system is not overwhelmed by the coronavirus.\\n\\nAnd ultimately, it is about saving lives.\\xa0 We talk about the numbers — and I’m going to ask Dr. Birx to come up and reflect on them — but I think all of us know this is one American at a time.\\xa0 It’s one heartbreak at a time.\\xa0 And having lost loved ones in my life, just like everyone here and everyone looking on, we want to work every day to make that number of losses the lowest possible.\\xa0 And it will take all of us to do it and to keep doing exactly what we’re doing through today.\\n\\nDr. Birx?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\\n\\nI just want to start where the Vice President left off.\\xa0 I come out of the services; I’m Army.\\xa0 When you — we always talk about honoring the fallen.\\xa0 And I think, for every American, what we can do now to honor the fallen that have fallen, and given their — really, their deaths to this just horrible disease; to the healthcare workers that are on the frontlines trying to save every single one, to honor them; and to honor our elders and the individuals that we know are at the greatest risk for bad outcomes, we all need to continue to do our work.\\n\\nYes, the number of cases has stabilizing — or is stabilizing, but I do want to go through those numbers with you because we talk about these as micro-epidemics in metro areas and in rural areas.\\n\\nSo, in the New York metro area — which includes, obviously, Northern New Jersey, Connecticut, and Rhode Island — there are still 11,000 new cases per day and their positivity rate on their testing is still in the 40 percent-plus range.\\xa0 So there’s still a significant amount of disease there and everyone needs to continue to follow the guidelines.\\n\\nNew Orleans metro area — 800 new cases per day, but a seropositivity rate on their testing of 28 percent.\\xa0 Detroit metro area — 1,400 cases per day, 26 percent positivity.\\xa0 Chicago — 1,200 cases per day and 18 percent.\\xa0 Boston — 18 percent positivity, 1,100 cases per day.\\xa0 Denver has fallen to 180 cases per day, but still has 15 percent seropositivity in their testing.\\xa0 California and Washington have stayed stable at about — Seattle, 350 cases per day. On the LA metro area — 800 cases per day, but their test-positive rates are remaining in the 9 percent range.\\n\\nAnd so this really gives us some idea of what it takes.\\xa0 They have been continuously mitigating.\\xa0 Imagine what we’re talking about — New York going from 40-plus percent seropositivity and 11,000 cases a day, down to the LA metro area of 800 cases per day and 9 percent.\\n\\nSo, this is what, when the President talks about reaching the top and coming down, those are the kinds of things we need to see.\\xa0 And the only way we will see them is if every American continues to follow the guidance.\\n\\nNow, in the Philadelphia metro area, where I come from, it’s 1,400 cases per day.\\xa0 This, of course, includes Camden, and the counties around the Philadelphia metro, and Wilmington.\\xa0 And in the Baltimore and the Washington, D.C., area — 15 percent seropositivity and 500 cases per day, and 200 cases per day in Baltimore.\\n\\nThis is how we’re looking at it — county by county, metro by metro, rural region by rural region — to make sure we don’t miss anything.\\xa0 And we’re triangulating testing data with the attack rates, with the hospitalization, with the number of cases, and really creating a mosaic of who needs what when to ensure that every American is served well.\\n\\nI had a great call today with a group of pediatricians, the head of the American Academy of Pediatrics, and with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\\xa0 Behind the scenes and working every day are the pediatricians fielding those phone calls from every concerned mother, and, of course, grandmothers like myself, and protecting our children every day to ensure that they have access to the medical care that they need while this is happening.\\n\\nAnd to every pregnant woman out there, I was very reassured, hearing from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\\xa0 They have put amazing things in place to protect every pregnant woman.\\xa0 They have been social distancing in their offices.\\xa0 They have increased all of the disinfecting.\\xa0 They have lengthened the time between clients.\\xa0 To every pregnant woman: Don’t miss your appointments.\\xa0 If your OB thinks you need to be there, you should go.\\xa0 And please know that on the labor and delivery wards they are doing everything to protect you and their babies.\\xa0 They are committed to you.\\xa0 They are absolutely committed to you having a good experience.\\xa0 Make sure — if your physician believes you should be in the hospital for your delivery, make sure you’re following their guidance.\\xa0 We don’t want any pregnant women to suffer a bad outcome during this time.\\n\\nSo, again, I just want to conclude by thanking the American people and recognizing the number of people we’re losing per day is serious to all of us and it could be so much worse, but our frontline healthcare providers and the way they’re talking to each other about how to improve care for every individual that they serve — you see them on the TV, you see them in the emergency room, you see what they’re up against — this is how we can honor them, is to make sure we continue to put, as Dr. Fauci always says, put your foot on the gas, and make sure that we continue to strongly mitigate, and really protect those with preexisting conditions.\\n\\nAnd finally, those preexisting conditions, we know now, include asthma.\\xa0 So, asthma, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes — any of these conditions — renal disease — no matter what age, please make sure you’re following the guidelines to protect those individuals in your household.\\xa0 We know they’re more susceptible to a worse outcome.\\n\\nWe don’t think that anyone’s more susceptible to getting infected.\\xa0 I want to make sure that everyone understands: Everybody is susceptible to getting infected.\\xa0 This virus is very transmittable, as we well know.\\xa0 But we need to protect those that need our protection the most.\\n\\nSo thank you all for what you’re doing to get the message out to ensure that we continue to protect each other in this very difficult time.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Great.\\xa0 Dr. Fauci, please.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 And just to follow up and underscore what Dr. Birx has said: As I’ve said many times from this podium, the spectrum of going from infection to getting ill to requiring hospitalization to intensive care to death — and what is the most striking thing that, obviously, is so sobering to us, is when we see the number of deaths, we know now for sure that the mitigation that we have been doing is having a positive effect, but you don’t see it until weeks later.\\n\\nRemember, this past weekend, when we — all of us got up in front of this podium and mentioned that this was going to be a really bad week, at the same time, we were saying that we would hope we would start to see a little bit of a change in the daily hospitalizations, intensive care, and intubations.\\xa0 And New York is starting to see that.\\n\\nSo I say that, but I drop back a bit.\\xa0 Don’t get complacent about that, because what’s going to happen two and a half weeks from now is really what’s going to happen with regard to the people who are getting new infections.\\xa0 As Dr. Birx said, everybody is almost certainly as susceptible as anybody else to getting infected — it’s what happens to you after you get infected.\\n\\nAnd again, to just keep emphasizing we need to keep mitigating.\\xa0 We know that this is something that is a strain on the American public, but it’s just something that we have — not only the only tool, it’s the best tool.\\n\\nAnd to just shift a bit to what we said yesterday regarding the African American community, it is very painful to see — and I’ve seen it throughout my entire medical career — that the health disparities in the minority community, but particularly the African American community, puts them at risk — apart from coronavirus issues, puts them at risk for diseases much more so than the general population.\\n\\nThe double whammy that you suffer now is when you have this terrible virus, which essentially preys, in its ultimate deleterious effects, on people with those underlying conditions.\\n\\nAnd since that is more predominant in the African American population, we want to double down and say to the young people, to the elderly people in that community, to please try as best as you can to protect yourself if you’re a younger person, and to please protect the people who are susceptible: your grandmother, your grandfather, your elder uncle, the people who have these underlying conditions.\\n\\nBecause we are not going to solve the issues of health disparities this month or next month.\\xa0 This is something we should commit ourselves for years to do.\\xa0 But what we can do now, today, is to prevent people who are put at higher risk because of the demographic group from getting into a situation which is much, much more deleterious than the general population.\\n\\nSo I plead with all of us in the population, but particularly for those of us, our brothers and sisters in the African American community, because we know that mitigation does work.\\xa0 The reason we know it works is the question that was asked about the numbers, that — why they came down with the projections.\\xa0 Because remember, what you do with data will always outstrip a model.\\xa0 You redo your models, depending upon your data, and our data is telling us that mitigation is working.\\n\\nSo, again, as Dr. Birx said, keep your foot on the accelerator because that’s what’s going to get us through this.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s true.\\n\\nDr. Redfield?\\n\\nDR. REDFIELD:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 I just wanted to follow up.\\xa0 One of the most important things we can do is keep our critical workforce working.\\xa0 And I think you heard it said that we have many different critical workforce industries in this country.\\xa0 Obviously, first responders, healthcare workers.\\xa0 But as you heard, it’s also individuals who helped maintain our food supply, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd so what CDC has done is that we’ve really looked at the essential workforce and how to maintain that workforce, particularly at this time as we begin to get ready to reopen and have confidence in bringing our workforces back to work.\\n\\nAnd so we put out a new guidance for essential healthcare workers who’ve been exposed to the coronavirus.\\xa0 These are individuals that have been within six feet of a confirmed case or a suspected case.\\xa0 And so that they can — under certain circumstances, they can go back to work.\\xa0 If they’re asymptomatic, as the Vice President, they could go back to work if they do several things, as we say here — take their temperature before they go to work, wear a face mask at all times, and practice social distancing when they’re at work.\\n\\nWhat we’d ask them not to do, when they’re at work, is — we want them to stay at home if they’re sick.\\xa0 We want them not to share objects that would be touching their face.\\xa0 And we would like them not to congregate in break rooms, lunch rooms, and crowded places.\\n\\nAnd then the second slide.\\xa0 If we’re talking to the employers of these critical industries, we would ask those employers to take the employee’s temperature and assess their symptoms before starting them back to work.\\n\\nIf the employee does become sick, we want them to be sent home immediately.\\xa0 We’d like them to increase air exchange in the buildings, and increase the frequency of how they clean common surfaces, and really begin to get these workers back into the critical workforce so that we won’t have worker shortage in these critical industries.\\n\\nSo that’s the new guidelines that CDC will be posting today.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And those will be available at CDC.gov.\\xa0 And thank you, Dr. Redfield.\\n\\nAnd questions for anyone on the panel?\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just a couple things to clarify.\\xa0 The 500 million masks that the President mentioned that are being developed, are those for healthcare workers?\\xa0 Or are you planning to actually hand out masks to the American public?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think the focus has been to make sure that our healthcare workers and our healthcare system has the supply.\\xa0 And with regard to what we’re gathering from literally around the world and from manufacturers in the United States, is first being deployed to states to the hospital systems.\\n\\nBut I must tell you that whether it be the Hanes company or other companies, we’re seeing manufacturers in America that are — that are recognizing the growing demand for masks by the American people and are spinning up production literally by the hour.\\n\\nBut our focus — our continuing focus is on making sure that healthcare workers have the personal protective equipment to do their job safely and provide the level of care that every one of us would want.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 Kansas Governor Laura Kelly says that she has put in seven requests to FEMA for supplies from the stockpile and those have not been fulfilled.\\xa0 So will Kansas be getting any of the ventilators, because the request included ventilators?\\xa0 And does she need to be calling the White House instead?\\xa0 Have you spoken with her directly?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I have not spoken to the governor directly, but I’ll — I’ll reach out this evening, certainly.\\n\\nIn our conference call with governors this week, we were — we spoke to them about the approach that we are taking.\\xa0 You know, traditionally, governors are accustomed to — when — when a hurricane strikes the Gulf Coast, when wildfires strike out west, when flooding or tornadoes hit in places like Indiana, you’re accustomed to have a declaration of emergency approved and then resources flow from FEMA.\\n\\nIn this situation, as we deal with a nationwide declaration and an epidemic, what we’ve explained to governors is that what President Trump has directed is that we — we leave no stone unturned to find resources around the country and around the world, including ventilators, and we make sure, as — as the coronavirus epidemic impacts individual areas, that the healthcare workers and the families and the patients impacted have what they need, when they need it.\\n\\nAnd what I would say to the people of Kansas is that we’re looking at their numbers every day, just as in the case of every state in the country.\\xa0 And — and we’re going to work our hearts out to make sure that — that as — as the coronavirus cases emerge — and we hope that through the great work that Kansas has done on social distancing and mitigation — the people of Kansas have done a remarkable job — that — that we may well be to a place where their existing resources and capacities are present.\\n\\nBut we want people to know that — that, taking the counsel of Dr. Birx and our entire healthcare team, we’re focusing — just as we did first in Seattle, California, and — and now in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Louisiana, the Detroit area, the Chicago area — we’re going to make sure that those resources go in that order.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And so, because you brought up social distancing and the work that Kansas has done, there is actually controversy right now over her order to limit the number of people in religious gatherings to 10 people.\\xa0 Should states be telling religious institutions how many people can gather if it’s to stop the spread of the coronavirus?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America ask every American to avoid any gathering of more than 10 people.\\xa0 And that’s on the advice of all of our best scientific experts as a way that we can — we can slow the spread.\\n\\nBut as we’ve made clear to every governor, we — we defer to our governors in what they believe is the best and appropriate practice in their states, and we’ll support those local decisions.\\n\\nYes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 In his opening statement, the President said there were 10 drugs that are now in clinical trials.\\xa0 Would hydroxychloroquine be one of those?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I can — I can speak to that just — and then I’d — I’ll invite Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci to come forward.\\n\\nWe do have — I believe we will have roughly four separate clinical trials underway studying hydroxychloroquine, but it’s important to remember that — that, as the President has made the point many times, the FDA has approved what’s called “off-label use.”\\xa0 And so, in consulting with your physician, if your physician determines it’s appropriate to write a prescription for hydrochloroquine, we’re working today to make that available across the country.\\n\\nIt’s broadly available today as an anti-malaria medication, but we’re working around the country and internationally to increase that supply.\\xa0 But we are — we are studying it in at least four different clinical trials.\\xa0 And Dr. Fauci can speak to that.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Yeah, so the easiest — thank you for that question.\\xa0 The easiest way to find out is to just go to ClinicalTrials.gov, and it will tell you everything that’s there.\\n\\nThere are a number of different clinical trials, some of which are randomized controlled trials, which, as I’ve said many times in this podium, to me, it’s the optimal way to determine ultimately if something is safe and effective and works.\\n\\nBut there are a lot of different ways that — that this being looked.\\xa0 It’s being looked at against the placebo.\\xa0 It’s being part of a multi-arm trial, comparing it with others.\\xa0 There is a trial that was recently started actually in prophylaxis among healthcare workers.\\xa0 So there were several of these.\\n\\nIn addition to that, there is what was just mentioned now:\\xa0 that any physician, in consultation with their patient and back and forth, can make the decision to use the drug on an off-label.\\n\\nSo we have two things that are simultaneously going on: We’re having actual formal clinical trials and the off-label use.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Very good.\\xa0 Next, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I want to turn back to the disproportionate rates of black deaths, when it comes to the coronavirus.\\xa0 Dr. Fauci, you have been talking about this for weeks, that there were underlying health issues — people with underlying health issues are most at risk.\\xa0 But if we knew that blacks disproportionately have fallen into that category, why wasn’t the CDC prepared to gather this data in real-time to work to fight this?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Well, I’m not sure.\\xa0 But we have the Director of the CDC here who could answer that question.\\xa0 But let me — let me try to just take it from — from a different perspective.\\n\\nThe health disparities that exist are not anything that started with coronavirus.\\xa0 They were — they were there.\\xa0 So there isn’t much you can do about the disparity.\\xa0 The thing you can do is to make an extra special effort to protect people who have the underlying conditions.\\xa0 So it’s the same way as we say, “Well, the elderly and those with underlying conditions.”\\n\\nUnfortunately, the African American community has a much greater proportion, population for population, of these underlying conditions.\\xa0 So the best weapon we have right now is what I said in my opening remarks — is to do whatever we can to get them to realize that what we need to do is to protect them from getting infected and to also protect them from inadvertently and innocently bringing the infection to people who have these underlying conditions.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 Can you explain the thinking behind these 100 ventilators that were given to Colorado when other states, like Kansas, have had trouble getting ventilators?\\xa0 And can you say whether a personal relationship with the President is helping states like Colorado get these ventilators?\\xa0 I mean, there are 15 states that have more cases than Colorado.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, what I could say is that we’ve been watching Denver very closely.\\xa0 And like many of the other key areas that I touched on, it — we’re — we’re beginning to see some encouraging news.\\xa0 But in our interactions with — with the governor and with local officials and with the senator, we’ve made an effort not only in Colorado, but around the country to be particularly responsive to states where — where we’ve seen a growth in cases.\\n\\nBut I’m going to let Dr. Birx speak to that as well.\\xa0 There’s — literally beginning with New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Louisiana, the Detroit area in Michigan, the Chicago area, there’s a series of other cities, including Denver, that we’ve been watching very carefully.\\xa0 And while we’re beginning to see some encouraging news, we want healthcare workers in those communities to know for certain that that we’re going to move resources into those areas where we see significant outbreak.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can you just address the point about whether —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — whether individual governors’ relationships with the — with the President are getting preferential treatment?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 I can tell you, within that decision complex is not just the absolute number of cases, it’s the hospital capacity and what each of those hospitals have.\\n\\nSo remember, I think a couple of days ago, we talked about how the states are sending the information about ICU beds, hospital beds, ventilator needs.\\n\\nSo different states have different — which I don’t think any of us probably knew before this, but there are some states that have lots of ventilators, and there’s other states that, proportion to their population or by their cases of COVID, have less.\\xa0 And so I’m sure Denver and Colorado fit into that model where there were hospitals that had less ventilators proportionately and were needed for the cases that we’re seeing.\\n\\nSo, that’s the kind of analysis.\\xa0 So, every state that has cases — a little — has a few cases more than Colorado have all received ventilators, except for, I think, Texas.\\xa0 And that’s just because they are just starting — remember we started — Colorado was one early on the curve, so they have many more people who have moved through that progress and are in need of ventilators.\\xa0 Texas is very early in their curve in both Dallas and Houston.\\xa0 So that’s what I was talking about; each of these are a micro curve that we have to follow independently or we would be making general decisions, rather than specific decisions by geography.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Vice President, a follow-up on the churches question.\\xa0 You’re obviously a very religious man. \\xa0Will you be going to church on Sunday?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’ll be attending church right in the living room at the Vice President’s Residence, where we have been attending for the last several weeks.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And is that the guidance?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: \\xa0And the advantage is we get to go to our home church in Indiana.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is that the same example you’d like to see churches around the country, regardless of what governors are saying, do as well?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America are very clear.\\xa0 That during this 30 days, we are calling on every American in every state first to listen to your state and local authorities, but right after that to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people, avoid unnecessary travel, use drive-through at restaurant instead of going into the restaurant.\\xa0 We are, as these health experts have told you, seeing real evidence that we’re slowing the spread, that these mitigation efforts are having a strong impact.\\n\\nAnd tonight, as many people even at this hour on the East Coast are beginning to sit down to a Seder dinner — it’s the beginning of Passover — and with Easter celebrations this Sunday, we just want to encourage every American to heed the counsel of the guidelines, put those into effect, and know that in so doing we’ll hasten the day — we’ll hasten the day that we put the coronavirus in the past and we reopen our country.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Vice President —\\n\\nAIDE:\\xa0 Last question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I ask a question of Dr. Birx or Dr. Fauci?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Of course.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 As you are both probably aware, there’s a lot of misinformation and conspiracy theories out there about the coronavirus.\\xa0 There are some commentators who are suggesting that the number of dead are being inflated because they’re saying that people who are dying with other issues are being listed as COVID-19 deaths.\\xa0 Perhaps, you’ve seen some of this commentary.\\xa0 You may be too busy to see it, but it is out there.\\n\\nWhat do you say to those folks who are — who are making the claim without really any evidence that these deaths are being padded, that the number of COVID-19 deaths are being padded?\\xa0 For example, somebody who might die from a number of factors, but had coronavirus are being listed as “coronavirus deaths.”\\xa0 And because of that, the number is being inflated.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s a fair question.\\xa0 And you might also speak about the converse.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yeah, we’ve been hearing the converse too.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 We’ve been hearing the opposite.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 (Laughs.)\\xa0 We’ve been hearing both sides of that.\\xa0 I — you know, I think, we’ve made it very clear, I think, every time I’ve been up here, about the comorbidities.\\n\\nAnd so, they — most of the people — and we’ve talked about the Italy data.\\xa0 The majority of the Italians who succumbed to this had three or more comorbidities.\\xa0 So, this has been known from the beginning.\\xa0 So those individuals will have an underlying condition, but that underlying condition did not cause their acute death when it’s related to a COVID infection.\\xa0 In fact, it’s the opposite. \\xa0Having an underlying condition and getting this virus, we know is particularly damaging to those individuals.\\n\\nWe don’t know all the pathophysiology.\\xa0 I wish we did right now.\\xa0 We see that a lot of vasculitis — where Tony and I came from.\\xa0 Tony actually — Dr. Fauci started in the vasculitis in Wegener’s.\\xa0 So, I mean, these are things we have studied for a long time.\\xa0 We are trying to understand the pathophysiology.\\n\\nBut what we can tell you at this moment: If you have asthma, if you have renal disease, if you have diabetes, if you have hypertension — these are preexisting conditions that put you at a greater risk to having a worse outcome.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 So, Jim, just to add a comment to that because, you know, having been through other serious issues, particularly the very painful early years of HIV-AIDS, when people talk about conspiracy theories — you will always have conspiracy theories when you have very challenging public health crises.\\xa0 They are nothing but distractions.\\n\\nYou know, I can assure you we have so much to do to protect the health and the welfare of the American people that I would just hope we just put those conspiracy stuff, and let somebody write a book about it later on, but not now.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Birx, you said something about not enough tests being performed because some of the labs — the machines aren’t running.\\xa0 Did you want to clarify that?\\xa0 What did you mean by 80 percent weren’t running and —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So, I have a call with them at 8:00 p.m. tonight. Every single one of those 120 laboratories — I think 87 of the laboratory directors have confirmed that call.\\xa0 It has to do with a machine called an Abbott m2000.\\xa0 It’s a very high-throughput machine.\\xa0 We have a million tests out there.\\n\\nI made a big push and Abbott was extraordinary about getting those out to the labs.\\xa0 I mean, this is not sitting in a warehouse.\\xa0 These are physically in these laboratories, sitting there right now.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The machines aren’t running?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 They’re not running.\\xa0 So we’ve only run 88,000 tests in three weeks off of those machines with a million test kits.\\xa0 So, as someone who has worked in a lot of laboratories, to have a machine that is needed — because we could have screened every healthcare worker — these machines are in every place in the country.\\xa0 So, they could have screened, in these last three weeks, 100 percent of the healthcare workers across the country that needed these rapid — these tests to be done.\\xa0 And they’re high throughput.\\n\\nSo, I have a call with them at 8 o’clock to really talk about —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can the President compel that to happen?\\xa0 Can an order be given?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Well, I asked the Vice President to give me a chance to talk to my colleagues first.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 But we have a call with the CEOs of those hospitals tomorrow.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Great.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 That’s a really important question.\\xa0 And it underscores the fact that Dr. Birx pointed out that, with new — new test, Abbott Laboratories — with their — FEMA has been busy distributing to states around the country.\\xa0 We purchased 1,200 of these machines to be able to do these tests.\\xa0 But there’s 18,000 all across America.\\n\\nAnd so let me — let me just renew our call to all the — all the hospital administrators and lab operators around America to go and identify those Abbott Laboratories machines.\\xa0 And know that that’s — while we’ve already tested more than 1.9 million Americans, our — our short-term objective is to test as many Americans as possible as this — as we see the coronavirus epidemic emerge in areas around the country, we want to surge those resources.\\xa0 We want states that haven’t seen a significant outbreak to have access to that 15-minute test.\\n\\nAnd ultimately we — as we go forward, once we — as, you know, I think President Trump said today, nobody wants to open the country up more than him and I can attest to that.\\xa0 But we’re going to open it up when we can do so responsibly, putting the health of America first.\\n\\nAnd to reopen America and to stay open, America, we’re working around the clock to continually expand the kind of testing that will allow us to do what these experts call “surveillance” so that, in every state in the country, once we put this chapter of coronavirus behind us, we hope and trust sooner rather than later that when the next Fall comes, that we will have a vast array so that CDC can do what it does so well.\\xa0 And that is, when a particular disease emerges, CDC surges personnel, does contact tracing, isolates that individual.\\n\\nSo we’re just really calling on — calling on all of our partners in the laboratories and in hospitals around the country to identify those Abbott Laboratory machines and help us continue to scale up and expand testing.\\n\\nBut to every American, let me again just say thank you.\\xa0 Thank you for what you’re doing.\\xa0 We are in the midst of a week of heartache and I want to assure every American who has suffered loss that we’re with you.\\xa0 We’re praying for you and your families.\\xa0 And we’re — and we’ll continue to work our hearts out to make sure these incredible healthcare workers, who are inspiring every single one of us all across the country every day, have the resources and support and the equipment to do their job safely, to provide the level of care that any American family would want for their loved one, and to be able to go home safely to their families.\\n\\nAnd the key to all of that — the key for the next 22 days is “30 Days to Slow the Spread.”\\xa0 And I just encourage every American, if you haven’t done so recently, go to Coronavirus.gov.\\xa0 Print off your own copy.\\xa0 Pick up the phone and call a friend and just tell them that — that you heard from the experts, you heard from the President and our team that we’re beginning to see glimmers of hope.\\n\\nExtraordinary progress in California and Washington is a tribute to the people of those states and the leadership of those states.\\xa0 But the beginning of stabilization and perhaps even leveling in New York and New Jersey, Louisiana, and Detroit is a testament to the people of those communities, to the leadership of those states.\\n\\nBut understand that every one of us has a role to play to protect the most vulnerable among us and to save lives by putting the guidelines into practice, just like you’ve been doing every day since they were first announced.\\n\\nSo thank you all and we’ll see you tomorrow.\\n\\nEND',\n",

EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Today, we continue to send our love to the great people of New York and New Jersey.\\xa0 We support them fully.\\xa0 We grieve alongside every family who has lost a precious loved one.\\xa0 New Yorkers are tough and strong and brave.\\xa0 New Jerseyites are tough and strong and brave, and they’re being hit very hard right now.\\xa0 And for the next week, hopefully not much longer than that, it’s going to start to go in the other direction.\\n\\nOur country is being hit hard, but some areas have done so incredibly well.\\xa0 We’re so proud of them.\\xa0 They will beat this virus.\\xa0 We’re going to beat it with the grit and the heart for which they’re known and for which our country is known.\\xa0 And we appreciate everything that everybody is doing.\\n\\nWe also — we pray for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\\xa0 He’s become a great friend of ours.\\xa0 He loves this country; he loves his country.\\xa0 But he loves the USA.\\xa0 And he’s always been very good to us.\\xa0 Whenever we had difficulty, he was with us, and we appreciate it.\\xa0 So, we pray for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\\xa0 He’s going through a lot.\\n\\nAs we intensify our military campaign against the virus, I think that it must be brought out that we have to thank the American people for continuing to follow our guidelines on “slowing the spread” — an expression that more and more people are thinking about.\\xa0 Nobody ever heard of it two months ago, and now everybody is talking about “slowing the spread,” stopping the spread.\\n\\nEven during this painful week, we see glimmers of very, very strong hope.\\xa0 And this will be a very painful week.\\xa0 And next week, at least part of next week, but probably all of it — look, if one person dies, it’s a painful week.\\xa0 And we know that’s going to, unfortunately, happen.\\xa0 This is a monster we’re fighting.\\n\\nBut signs are that our strategy is totally working.\\xa0 Every American has a role to play in winning this war.\\xa0 And we’re going to be winning it.\\xa0 We’re going to be winning it powerfully.\\xa0 And we’ll be prepared for the next one, should it happen, but hopefully it won’t.\\n\\nOur massive airlift operation for critical supplies — it’s called Project Airbridge — continued today as five massive planes, flights, landed in the United States packed with personal protective equipment.\\xa0 And our nation’s heroic healthcare workers will be the beneficiaries of that.\\xa0 Twenty-seven more flights are scheduled in the near future, over the next couple of weeks.\\n\\nThe Army Corps of Engineers is constructing facilities that will support more than 15,000 hospital beds to treat patients in need.\\xa0 So they’re building now approximately 15,000.\\xa0 They just completed the big one in New York.\\xa0 They just completed and are in the process of continuing in Chicago and many other places.\\xa0 They’re incredible.\\xa0 The Army Corps of Engineers — we owe them a lot.\\xa0 What they’re able to do in such a short period of time — they’ll build these massive facilities.\\xa0 Two thousand beds in four days.\\xa0 So it’s really something very special.\\xa0 I know, I was in the construction industry, and you don’t see that happen very often.\\n\\nI want to remind governors and emergency managers that sharing real-time data with us about equipment and their needs is very important.\\xa0 All of their supplies, hospital occupancy is critical.\\xa0 A lot of the occupancy is really getting a little bit lower than anticipated, and that’s good.\\xa0 We, sort of, thought that was going to happen.\\n\\nAnd we’re getting along very well with the governors.\\xa0 This whole situation with respect to talking to us about equipment and equipment needs — giving us a little bit of lead time — so important.\\xa0 All the supplies — we’re getting it to everybody like they never thought possible.\\xa0 But we’ll ensure that we can rapidly deploy federal assets where and when they’re needed, especially on ventilators.\\n\\nWe’re actually getting some ventilators back.\\xa0 As you know, the State of California was great.\\xa0 They sent some back, which they won’t need. \\xa0And Washington State, likewise.\\xa0 And we have some others coming back, so we’re using them in areas we need them.\\n\\nWe are pressing forward aggressively on the scientific frontier of the medical war.\\xa0 The companies I’ve spoke to — the four leading — I call them the “genius companies”\\xa0— they’re doing incredibly well with respect to cures and also with respect to a vaccine that’s going to protect us — totally protect us.\\xa0 And they have some great potential.\\xa0 It’s going to take a little while yet, but they have some great potential. Some great early results.\\n\\nAnd the governors have been working hard, and we are working hard with the governors.\\xa0 There’s been great coordination, especially over the last little while.\\xa0 We’ve given them a lot of equipment, a lot of ventilators.\\xa0 But a lot of equipment of all types.\\xa0 And I will protect you if your governor fails.\\xa0 If you have a governor that’s failing, we’re going to protect you.\\xa0 But the governors are working well with us over the last period of time.\\n\\nToday, in our stockpile of ventilators — and again, we need the stockpile so we can immediately move them from place to place, wherever the monster hits.\\xa0 It’s a monster.\\xa0 We have 8,675 ventilators right now, in stock, ready to move.\\n\\nAnd we have all sorts of incredible soldiers.\\xa0 Our military is going to move them, should they be needed in, as an example, if we need additional in New York or the New York City area.\\xa0 You have state; you have city.\\xa0 And I spoke to Mayor de Blasio, and we really have a great, well-coordinated campaign with Mayor de Blasio.\\xa0 It’s been really good.\\xa0 I spoke to Governor Cuomo.\\xa0 There’s been great coordination.\\xa0 So, if they need something, we have it.\\n\\nIf Louisiana needs something, we have it.\\xa0 Same thing with Michigan.\\xa0 Same thing with Illinois.\\xa0 There are certain spots that are very hot.\\xa0 And we’ll see what happens, but we’ll know — pretty much, we’ll have time, and we’ll be able to move it.\\n\\nIn addition to the 8,675 ventilators, we have 2,200 arriving on April 13th.\\xa0 We have 5,500 arriving on May 4th.\\xa0 These are ones that we’re building, for the most part.\\xa0 And we have, as you know, great companies building them — Ford, General Motors, GE.\\xa0 We have, really, some great companies that are doing it.\\xa0 On May 18th, we have 12,000.\\xa0 On June 1st, we have 20,000.\\xa0 On June 29th, we have 60,000 ventilators coming.\\xa0 Sixty — 6-0.\\xa0 So we have a total of 110,000 ventilators coming over a short period of time.\\xa0 I don’t think we’ll need them.\\xa0 Hopefully, we won’t need them.\\xa0 I don’t think we’ll need anywhere near them.\\xa0 But we’ll have them for the future, and we’ll also be able to help other countries who are desperate for ventilators.\\n\\nThe UK called today and they wanted to know, would it be possible to get 200.\\xa0 And we’re going to work it out.\\xa0 We got to work it out.\\xa0 They’ve been great partners, the United Kingdom. And we’re going to work it out for them.\\xa0 So they wanted 200. They needed them desperately.\\n\\nWe now have 10 drugs in active trials, with 15 more soon to follow, as well as 2 vaccine candidates in active clinical trials.\\xa0 We’ll do whatever it takes to secure needed medical supplies and bring more production of essential medicines back to our shores.\\xa0 We’re doing that.\\xa0 We’re bringing them back to our shores.\\xa0 A lot of these companies — they went a little bit haywire.\\xa0 They went away from this great country and they had them produced elsewhere.\\xa0 So, we’re going to start bringing them back.\\xa0 I’ve been talking about that for a long time, not only with medical, but lots of other things.\\n\\nAmerica continues to perform more tests than any other nation in the world.\\xa0 And I think that’s probably why we have more cases.\\xa0 Because when you look at some of these very large countries, they — I know they — I know for a fact that they have far more cases than we do, but they don’t report them.\\n\\nWe’ve performed 1.87 million tests to date.\\xa0 So that’s 1 million 870 thousand — million tests.\\xa0 Think of that: 1,870,000 tests to date.\\xa0 And now we’re performing them at a level that nobody has ever seen before.\\n\\nAs we announced yesterday, CVS testing sites in Georgia and Rhode Island will be using Abbott Labs rapid five-minute test. We’re down to now five minutes.\\xa0 It’s a five-minute test so that people can get their results back very quickly.\\n\\nAnd we’re actively engaging on the problem of increased impacts — this is a real problem, and it’s showing up very strongly in our data — on the African American community.\\xa0 And we’re doing everything in our power to address this challenge.\\xa0 It’s a tremendous challenge.\\xa0 It’s terrible.\\xa0 And provide support to African American citizens of this country who are going through a lot.\\xa0 But it’s been disproportional.\\xa0 They’re getting hit very, very hard.\\n\\nIn fact, while we have Tony here, I’d like to maybe have you come up and address that one, and then I’ll continue.\\xa0 But if you could address that, it would be great, Tony.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 We have a particularly difficult problem of an exacerbation of a health disparity.\\xa0 We’ve known, literally forever, that diseases like diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and asthma are disproportionately afflicting the minority populations, particularly the African Americans.\\n\\nUnfortunately, when you look at the predisposing conditions that lead to a bad outcome with coronavirus — the things that get people into ICUs that require intubation and often lead to death, they are just those very comorbidities that are, unfortunately, disproportionately prevalent in the African American population.\\xa0 So we’re very concerned about that.\\xa0 It’s very sad.\\xa0 There’s nothing we can do about it right now, except to try and give them the best possible care to avoid those complications.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 And, Tony, I think you’re going to have some pretty accurate numbers over the next few days, right?\\xa0 But they are very — they’re very nasty numbers.\\xa0 Terrible numbers.\\n\\nIn total, 1,200 Abbott machines — Abbott Laboratories, they’ve been fantastic — have been shipped now nationwide.\\xa0 Up to 500 more are being produced every week, and 50,000 testing cartridges are being manufactured per day.\\xa0 That means a lot of very fast tests.\\xa0 No nation in the world has developed a more diverse and robust testing capacity than the United States.\\n\\nWe’re dealing with other nations, helping them out because the testing is very tough for them.\\xa0 And our tests are very accurate.\\xa0 A lot of tests are out there, and they’re not accurate at all.\\xa0 In fact, some of the tests, you don’t have a clue what’s going on.\\xa0 So we’re working with other nations trying to get them help, also.\\n\\nAt a time when many Americans are experiencing increased stress, anxiety, and personal loss, we must also ensure that our country can meet the mental health needs of those struggling in this crisis.\\xa0 There are people struggling.\\xa0 They’re struggling.\\xa0 And some people are getting to know each other, frankly.\\xa0 Some families are getting to know each other, on a positive note.\\xa0 But there are a lot of people struggling.\\n\\nOn Thursday, I’ll be speaking to leaders and advocates from the mental health organizations all across our country.\\xa0 And we are going to be talking about resources and tools that we’ll make available to them.\\xa0 They need help.\\xa0 And it’s a big problem.\\n\\nWhen you take something where it was the most successful country in the world — still is — the whole world is shut down.\\xa0 Think of it: We’re down to numbers that are incredible.\\n\\nAs I said yesterday, I think it’s 182 countries right now.\\xa0 One hundred and eighty-two countries are under attack by the — by the scourge, by this virus.\\n\\nBut as we wage medical war on the virus, we’re also speeding economic relief to our people.\\xa0 It’s incredible.\\xa0 We just had a meeting that was absolutely incredible with the banks.\\xa0 I spoke with leaders in the banking and finance industry about our efforts to help American workers and employers.\\n\\nAs of today, small business has proc- — has processed more than $70 billion in guaranteed loans and will provide much-needed relief for nearly a quarter of a million businesses already.\\n\\nSo we are going to be providing tremendous amounts of money to the small businesses of our country who have been absolutely clobbered.\\xa0 And they’ll be keeping open and they’ll be paying their employees, and they’ll be all set to go.\\xa0 We’re going to have a rocket upward.\\n\\nI want to thank David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs; Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America; Gordon Smith, co-president, COO of JPMorgan Chase; Charles Scharf, CEO of Wells Fargo;\\xa0 Michael Corbat, CEO of Citigroup; Al Kelly, CEO of Visa;\\xa0 Michael Miebach, CEO of Mastercard; Noah Wilcox, CEO, chairman of Grand Rapids State Bank.\\xa0 And we had numerous others also on the call.\\xa0 And I just appreciate them.\\n\\nThey are — we’re way ahead of schedule, by the way.\\xa0 We’re way ahead of schedule.\\xa0 The Paycheck Protection Program has been incredible.\\n\\nSo based on the incredible success of the program, I’m announcing that I’ll be asking Congress to provide an additional $250 billion for the paycheck protection, which will help keep Americans employed to facilitate a quick and full recovery.\\n\\nWe’re doing very well.\\xa0 We’re looking very bipartisan.\\xa0 A lot of people want to do it.\\xa0 And the — the plan is amazing.\\xa0 You know, they’re processing hundreds of thousands of loans.\\xa0 And this is the big banks that are doing it, the community banks.\\xa0 But the biggest banks right now in our country are doing it, and they’re — they’re doing it for a lot of reasons.\\xa0 One of them is they want to help people.\\n\\nThe WHO, that’s the World Health Organization, receives vast amounts of money from the United States.\\xa0 And we pay for a majority — biggest portion of their money.\\xa0 And they actually criticized and disagreed with my travel ban at the time I did it.\\xa0 And they were wrong.\\xa0 They’ve been wrong about a lot of things.\\xa0 And they had a lot of information early and they didn’t want to — they’re very — they seem to be very China-centric.\\xa0 And we have to look into that.\\xa0 So we’re going to look into it.\\n\\nWe pay for — we give a majority of the money that they get.\\xa0 And it’s much more than that the 58.\\xa0 Fifty-eight million dollars is a small portion of what they’ve gotten over the years.\\xa0 Sometimes they get much more than that.\\xa0 Sometimes it’s for programs that they’re doing, and — and it’s much bigger numbers.\\xa0 And if the programs are good, that’s great, as far as we’re concerned.\\n\\nBut we want to look into it — World Health Organization — because they really are — they called it wrong.\\xa0 They called it wrong.\\xa0 They really — they missed the call.\\xa0 They could have called it months earlier.\\xa0 They would have known, and they should have known.\\xa0 And they probably did know, so we’ll be looking into that very carefully.\\n\\nAnd we’re going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO.\\xa0 We’re going to put a very powerful hold on it, and we’re going to see.\\xa0 It’s a great thing if it works, but when they call every shot wrong, that’s no good.\\n\\nWe’re in the midst of a great national struggle, one that requires the shared sacrifice of all Americans.\\xa0 In recent weeks, it’s been remarkable to see so many companies and organizations and individuals, like the banks that I just told you about — biggest banks in the world.\\xa0 They stepped up to help small business.\\xa0 They have big business, small business.\\xa0 The small business will someday be the big business.\\xa0 But the small business is 50 percent of our economic strength.\\xa0 People don’t realize when you add them up, but they just — they just rose to the occasion.\\xa0 Everybody is rising to the occasion.\\xa0 It’s been incredible to watch.\\n\\nTo honor and celebrate the extraordinary examples of patriotism and citizenship, we’re seeing — I’m asking Americans to use the hashtag #AmericaWorksTogether when sharing stories of how we’re all working together, get through — getting through this ordeal in a fashion that nobody would have ever thought possible.\\xa0 It’s been incredible.\\xa0 And that’s why the numbers are, so far, much better.\\xa0 We want to keep it that way.\\n\\nIf you look at the original projections: If we did nothing, it would be disastrous.\\xa0 If we — we decided to do something.\\xa0 We closed it down; had no choice.\\xa0 It was a good move.\\xa0 That was a good move.\\xa0 The early China move was a good move.\\xa0 The early Europe move was a good move.\\xa0 Made a lot of good moves.\\xa0 But closing it down was a big statement.\\xa0 It was a big, important thing.\\n\\nBut we’re looking to have far fewer deaths than originally thought.\\xa0 And I think we’re heading in that direction, but it’s too early to talk about it.\\xa0 I don’t even want to talk about it now because we just want to work.\\n\\nAnd I think that people are doing an incredible job.\\xa0 The doctors, the nurses, the firefighters, the police — all medical people, what they’re doing — the bravery that they’re displaying is just incredible.\\n\\nEvery citizen should take immense pride in the selfless — selflessness and all of the courage and compassion of our people.\\xa0 The workers — the people that are working and construction workers going into hospitals, knowing nothing about this problem, other than it’s dangerous.\\xa0 And they go in there to rebuild sections of hospitals.\\xa0 And you have people in really big trouble right next door.\\xa0 They know nothing about it.\\xa0 All they know is they’re going to get it done, they’re going to fix that wing so they can have more people in there.\\xa0 It’s incredible.\\n\\nBut this is a national spirit that won our independence and settled the frontier and explored the horizons of space.\\xa0 And that’s what we’re doing.\\xa0 I mean, this is all — this is all new territory.\\n\\nIt unlocked the miracles of science and what — we’re doing that when you — I wish you could have heard the calls I had yesterday with these great companies that come up with cures to diseases.\\xa0 And the success they’ve had over the last 15 years is really amazing.\\xa0 So I just want to thank all of them.\\xa0 They’re working very hard.\\n\\nThey’re working with UK, right now, and the UK doctors — hopefully helping with their great Prime Minister.\\xa0 But these people are really a — tremendous signs of success are staring us right in the face.\\xa0 I think we’re going to have something that’s going to be great, in terms of vaccines and in terms of everything else that they’re doing, just helping — really helping us, helping the people of our country and helping, ultimately, the people of the world.\\n\\nSo I want to thank you all for being here.\\xa0 I will take some questions, and then I’m going to give it over to the Vice President and they’re going to go into great detail on to what we’re doing and all of the successful supplies and medical equipment that we’re getting — all of the ventilators.\\xa0 I’ve said it, but you can go over it in more detail if you’d like.\\xa0 But we’re taking in and building thousands and thousands of ventilators.\\xa0 And they’re very high quality.\\xa0 I said, “You got to go for the quality.”\\xa0 And these are quality companies doing it.\\n\\nSo — because there is a big difference between a good ventilator and a not-so-good ventilator, Tony, right?\\xa0 We’ve seen that.\\xa0 And — big difference.\\xa0 So we’re going top of the line.\\n\\nSteve, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The Acting Navy Secretary submitted his resignation today — Modly.\\xa0 Why did that become necessary?\\xa0 And what — what role did you have in this, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I had no role in it.\\xa0 I’ve heard — I don’t know him, but I’ve heard he was a very good man.\\xa0 And it was a — the whole thing was a very unfortunate — the captain should not have written a letter.\\xa0 He didn’t have to be Ernest Hemingway.\\xa0 He made a mistake, but he had a bad day.\\xa0 And I hate seeing bad things happen.\\xa0 The man made a mistake.\\n\\nBut, you know, you shouldn’t be writing letters and you should — you’re in the military.\\xa0 You’re the captain of a great ship, and you shouldn’t be writing letters and sending them to many people and then it gets out to the media.\\xa0 And, you know, the question is, “How did it get out to the media?”\\xa0 So there’s a lot of bad things happened there.\\n\\nAnd I had heard he did because he didn’t want to cause any disturbance for our country.\\xa0 So that was a — because he wouldn’t have had to resign.\\xa0 I would not have asked him.\\xa0 I don’t know him.\\xa0 I didn’t speak to him.\\xa0 But he did that, I think, just to end — end that problem.\\xa0 And I think in one — in really many ways, that was a very unselfish thing for him to do.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What should happen now to Commander Crozier, who left —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they’re going to look at that.\\xa0 I think Secretary of Defense, as you know, is — is — you know Mark Esper, and he’s very capable.\\xa0 And I think he’s looking at that right now.\\xa0 They’re — they’re going to just take it under regular Navy channels to see what they want to do.\\n\\nBut he made a mistake, but he shouldn’t have done that.\\xa0 And your Secretary probably shouldn’t have said quite what he said.\\xa0 He didn’t have to resign, but he felt it would be better for the country.\\xa0 So I — you know, I think it’s — it will end it quickly.\\n\\nYes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, Mr. President, a couple on the economic front.\\xa0 The $250 billion that was added today — or will be added for the Small Business Loan Program, it brings it to $600 billion in total.\\xa0 Do you think that figure is enough?\\xa0 Might there be some more down the line?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re going to find out.\\xa0 You know, when you see hundreds of thousands of applications — don’t forget, they’re for $3,000, for $7,000, some for a couple of million.\\xa0 I guess one of the banks had a couple of million.\\xa0 So they’re for different — very varying amounts of money.\\n\\nAnd there’s a limit on the top, and then there’s really no limit on the bottom as to what it might be.\\xa0 But it’s really popular.\\xa0 It’s hundreds of thousands of applications.\\xa0 They really like it.\\xa0 What I like is it keeps these companies together, these little companies.\\xa0 Just like we’re going to help the airlines and the big companies, we’re going to help the little companies.\\n\\nAnd the banks are run- — nobody is equipped to do a thing like that, but the banks are equipped.\\xa0 So, the banks are doing it.\\xa0 Big banks, small banks.\\xa0 We have many banks — community banks — and they’re processing the loans and they’ll be able to watch it and make sure it’s done properly.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There was a lot talk today, sir, as well about potentially reopening the economy in the upcoming weeks.\\xa0 You mentioned the other day about a potential economic task force.\\xa0 Can you give us some sort of update as to where that may or may not —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re thinking about that.\\xa0 But we want to open up, and we want to get it open soon.\\xa0 That’s why I think maybe we’re getting to the very top of the curve.\\n\\nI spoke with Governor Cuomo and he seems to think that he’s getting close, and I think a lot of people think that a lot of places are getting close.\\xa0 We want to start heading that — hitting the downside.\\xa0 And I think we’re going to be doing — this is going to be a very difficult week, however.\\xa0 This week will be a very difficult week.\\xa0 Because that’s the most difficult week, when you’re at that top position.\\xa0 And we’ll see what happens.\\xa0 We’ll\\xa0see what happens.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 When it does open up, what can the federal government do?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, the federal government has done a lot —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Because there is a lot of —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — and it’s going to do a lot.\\xa0 We want to — I really think that with the stimulus, we can maybe be — even beyond — we’re going to do, perhaps, infrastructure, which you wouldn’t have gotten approved before.\\xa0 And now people are looking to do it.\\n\\nAnd the beauty is we’re paying zero interest or very close to zero interest.\\xa0 In some cases, we’re paying actually zero — have no interest charge.\\xa0 And the dollar is very strong, and people are investing in the dollar.\\xa0 They want — you know, the fact that we have the strong currency — we have the currency.\\xa0 We — our currency is — is everything.\\n\\nAnd other companies, other countries want to be in our currency.\\xa0 So we’re — we’re getting all of the investment wanting to come into the dollar.\\xa0 The dollar is the strength.\\xa0 The dollar is the whole ballgame.\\xa0 We have a strong dollar.\\xa0 Other currencies are going down — way, way down in some cases.\\n\\nYou look at other countries — I won’t mention them — but other countries are going down 22 percent, 25 percent, 28 percent, and it’s very hard for them.\\xa0 That makes it much more difficult with us.\\xa0 Our currency is relatively now stronger than it ever was — or it was over the last few years relative to other countries.\\xa0 So it’s always relative to other countries, but our currency is very strong.\\n\\nSo, therefore, people want to invest.\\xa0 If we do a bond issue to do infrastructure, everybody wants a piece of that issue, even at zero interest.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 Did you see these memos that reportedly Peter Navarro wrote back in January?\\xa0 When did you see them?\\xa0 And how does that — these memos sort of square with what you’ve often said that nobody could’ve predicted this.\\xa0 It sounds like he was predicting it.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I didn’t see them, but I heard he wrote some memos talking about pandemic.\\xa0 I didn’t see them.\\xa0 I didn’t look for them either.\\n\\nBut that was about the same time as I felt that we should do it.\\xa0 We — that was about the same time that I closed it down.\\xa0 I asked him about it just a little while ago, because I read something about a memo.\\xa0 I said, “Did you do a memo?”\\xa0 I didn’t look for — I didn’t see it.\\xa0 I didn’t ask him to show it to me.\\xa0 He said, “Yes, I talked about the possibility of a pandemic.”\\xa0 Nobody said it’s going to happen, but, you know, there is a possibility.\\xa0 There always has been a possibility, but people wouldn’t talk about it.\\n\\nBut it was right about the time that I closed it down.\\xa0 And interestingly, the World Health Organization was not in favor of us closing it down.\\xa0 And if we didn’t close it down, we would have lost hundreds of thousands more lives.\\xa0 So, we did a good thing.\\xa0 We did a good thing.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So at the time, though, when — when Peter Navarro did circulate those memos, you were still downplaying the threat of coronavirus in the U.S.\\xa0 You were saying things like, “I think it’s a problem that’s going to go away within a couple of days.”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Which I’m right about.\\xa0 It did go — it will go away.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You said, “Within a couple of days, the cases will be down to zero.”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, the cases really didn’t build up for a while.\\xa0 But you have to understand, I’m a cheerleader for this country.\\xa0 I don’t want to create havoc and shock and everything else, but ultimately, when I was saying that, I’m also closing it down.\\xa0 I obviously was concerned about it because I closed down our country to China, which was heavily infected.\\n\\nI then closed it down to Europe.\\xa0 That’s a big move –closing it down from China and then closing it down from Europe, and then, ultimately, closing it down to the U.K.\\xa0 So — and it was right about that time.\\xa0 But I’m not going to go out and start screaming, “This could happen.\\xa0 This could happen.”\\n\\nSo, again, as President, I think a president has to be a cheerleader for their country.\\xa0 But at the same time I’m cheerleading, I’m also closing down a very highly infected place, specifically the location, as you know, in China that had the problems.\\xa0 And we’re closing it down, but we closed it down to all of China, then we closed it down to all of Europe.\\xa0 Those were big moves, and it was right about that time.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, just a quick — just a quick follow-up, Mr. President. \\xa0Mr. President —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can you just clarify: Did you just learned about this today?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Say it?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You learned about the memo today?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I read about it maybe a day ago, two days ago.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You feel like someone in your — among your staff or Peter Navarro himself should have told you about the memo earlier?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, not at all.\\xa0 It was a recommendation.\\xa0 It was a feeling that he had.\\xa0 I think he told certain people in the staff, but it didn’t matter.\\xa0 I didn’t see it, but I did — I closed it down.\\xa0 I don’t remember it even being discussed.\\n\\nWe had a meeting where there were a lot of people.\\xa0 Most people felt they should not close it down — that we shouldn’t close down to China.\\xa0 But I felt we had to do it.\\xa0 And that was at almost the exact same time as the memo.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If you had read the memo at the time, how would that have changed the steps you took or the statements that you made around the time about the dangers of the virus?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t think it would’ve changed, because I did — I basically did what the memo said.\\xa0 And the memo was — you know, the memo was a pretty good memo, from the standpoint that he talked.\\xa0 I guess, I didn’t see it yet.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 He was seeing that the U.S. would — warning that the U.S. could lose trillions of dollars and millions of lives.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, you’re not going to lose millions of lives, but you’ll lose plenty of money.\\xa0 But I couldn’t have done it any better because it was about the same time, and I closed it down to China.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And just lastly, so you maintain confidence in him, in Peter Navarro?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Of course, I maintain con- —\\xa0he wrote a memo and he was right.\\xa0 And I haven’t seen the memo.\\xa0 I’ll see it later on after this, but it didn’t matter whether I saw it or not, because I — I acted on my own.\\xa0 I guess I had the same instincts as Peter.\\xa0 Peter is a smart guy and he’s a good guy, and he’s done a wonderful job.\\xa0 But he wrote a memo and, I guess, he talked to various people about it.\\n\\nBut ultimately, I did what the memo — more or less what the memo said just about the time the memo came out.\\xa0 I closed it down.\\xa0 I took a lot of heat.\\xa0 The World — you know — Health Organization was very much against.\\xa0 They didn’t like it.\\xa0 They actually put out statements about it.\\n\\nIn all fairness to Joe Biden, he called me xenophobic, like I don’t like China.\\xa0 I like China.\\xa0 I like — the Chinese people are phenomenal people.\\xa0 So, I was called xenophobic, I was called racist.\\xa0 “How could I do a thing like this?”\\n\\nNow, since then, Joe said that he was wrong, and he said that I was right.\\xa0 But I closed it down, and I was called names by some of the morning show hosts who don’t have a clue what they’re talking about.\\xa0 They’re not smart people.\\xa0 And I was called all sorts of names when I closed it down to China.\\xa0 Now they try and hide that — you know, the tape of them saying terrible things.\\xa0 But that was a great decision.\\n\\nIf I didn’t do it — if I didn’t do that, we would’ve had hundreds of thousands more people dying.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You talked a lot about the WHO, and I was wondering — Dr. Fauci had discussed them earlier, so if I could ask you a question about that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, he respects the WHO, and I think that’s — that’s good.\\xa0 And he’s worked with them for a long time.\\xa0 But they did give us some pretty bad play calling.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But they’ve also, I think, given lots of countries in the world accurate coronavirus testing that’s been central to your guys’ data modeling.\\xa0 And so, I’m —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, that, I don’t know.\\xa0 I can only say that, with regard to us, they’re taking a lot of heat because they didn’t want the borders closed; they called it wrong.\\xa0 They called — they really called, I would say, every aspect of it wrong.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So say that the funding freeze does not — doesn’t —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I’m not happy about it.\\xa0 Look, we fund it.\\xa0 Take a look.\\xa0 I mean, go through step by step.\\xa0 They said there’s no big deal, there’s no big problem, there’s no nothing.\\xa0 And then, ultimately, when I closed it down, they actually said that I made a mistake in closing it down.\\xa0 And it was — it turned out to be right.\\xa0 But at the time they — you know, they did that.\\n\\nSo we’re just going to take a look at it.\\xa0 You know, we fund it.\\xa0 And — and they seem to be — you know, I said recently — and social media said, “They seem to be very China-centric.”\\xa0 That’s a nice way of saying it.\\xa0 But they seem to be very China-centric.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But if your public health advisors are telling you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And they seem to err always on the side of China, and we fund it.\\xa0 You know, so I want to look into it.\\n\\nYes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thanks.\\xa0 A quick follow-up on that.\\xa0 So is the time to freeze funding to the WHO during a pandemic of this magnitude?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, maybe not.\\xa0 I mean, I’m not saying I’m going to do it, but we’re going to look at it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You did say that you’re going to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We give a tremendous —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You said you’d put a hold on it.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I didn’t.\\xa0 I said we’re going to look at it.\\xa0 We’re going to investigate it.\\xa0 We’re going to look at it.\\xa0 But we will look at ending funding.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0And to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, because you know what?\\xa0 They called it wrong.\\xa0 And if you look back over the years even, they’re very much — everything seems to be very biased toward China.\\xa0 That’s not right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I wanted to follow up.\\xa0 You talked about African Americans and how they’ve been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Seems to be, unfortunately.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you plan on requiring the CDC, any federal agencies or state agen- — public places doing tests and private companies doing tests to collect that data on the race of the people being tested and the race of the people being treated and the outcomes?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re just seeing tremendous — we’re seeing tremendous evidence that African Americans are affected at a far greater percentage number than other citizens of our country, because we’re dealing with our country.\\xa0 Now we’re looking at it from a worldwide standpoint.\\xa0 Tony Fauci is looking at it very strongly, but these numbers have started to come out, and they’re — they’re very strong.\\xa0 And they’re pretty obvious.\\xa0 I mean, you’re — you’re talking about —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Seema has —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And you will release that — but you will release that publicly?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Seema, would you like to talk about that for a second?\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nADMINISTRATOR VERMA:\\xa0 I think one of the things that we’re going to —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 She has the data.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good.\\n\\nADMINISTRATOR VERMA:\\xa0 — be doing with our Medicare data is to do that analysis.\\xa0 We’re going to look back at the last month or so, and look at, you know, related-type illnesses.\\n\\nGoing forward, we now have a code for coronavirus, so we can actually stratify by demographic information so we can look at race as a factor.\\xa0 We can also look at what the underlying health issues are as well.\\xa0 So we’ll be providing that data very shortly, but we will be doing that analysis.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re working on that very hard.\\xa0 This is something that’s come up over the last — I hadn’t heard this.\\xa0 And then, over the last few days, this has come up more and more.\\xa0 And I don’t mean by a little bit.\\xa0 I mean, many times.\\xa0 It’s a real thing.\\xa0 Now, we want to find cures, we want to find therapeutics, we want to find vaccines, because that will solve everybody’s problem.\\n\\nBut why is it that the African American community is so much, you know, numerous times more than everybody else?\\xa0 And we want to find the reason to it.\\xa0 And Dr. Fauci, Seema, both of them and others are working on this, and they’re going to have very good — I would say over the next — in less than a week —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Two days.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — I think you’re going to have very good statistics.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Two days.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Couple of days.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So do you plan to do something specifically aimed at those communities that are being hard hit?\\xa0 Those black communities that are being hard hit?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re helping them a lot.\\xa0 But what’s happening is we’re trying to find out why is it that it’s three and four times.\\xa0 Now, maybe that’s not going to be the final number.\\xa0 But why is it three or four times more so for the black community as opposed to other people?\\xa0 It doesn’t make sense, and I don’t like it.\\xa0 And we’re going to have statistics over the next, probably, two to three days.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, please.\\xa0 In the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 I’d like to ask a question on behalf of myself and a colleague who couldn’t be here due to social distancing.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Who are you with?\\xa0 Who?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 With Hearst Newspapers.\\xa0 I’m the print pooler today.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Some banks are only providing Paycheck Protection Program loans to clients with whom they have existing banking relationships.\\xa0 And you spoke to banking CEOs today.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I did.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I wonder if you’ll ask them — these lenders — to accept applications from all small businesses —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — not just the businesses with whom they have existing relationships.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 They’ll be doing that.\\xa0 But we’re also working with small community banks.\\xa0 So they will be doing that.\\xa0 It’s a question I’ve already spoken about.\\xa0 I mean, in many cases, they have long-term relationships with thousands of companies.\\xa0 I was amazed to see how many — you know, you saw the number of applications.\\xa0 It’s hundreds of thousands.\\xa0 It’s a lot of work.\\xa0 But I did ask that question, and they are working on that.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 And my second question from a colleague is: Congressman Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Northern Virginia, told the local D.C. CBS station that you personally requested the CARES Act stimulus bill be stripped of $25 billion for the Postal Service.\\xa0 Connolly claims that unless the USPS gets that $25 billion, the agency will be run out of money by June.\\xa0 He accuses you of hastening the demise of the Postal Service.\\xa0 Could you respond to that, please?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, the biggest — oh, I’m the reason the Postal Service — the Postal Service has lost billions of dollars every year for many, many years.\\xa0 So I’m the demise?\\xa0 This is a new one.\\xa0 I’m now the demise of the Postal Service.\\n\\nI’ll tell you who’s the demise of the Postal Service are these Internet companies that give their stuff to the Postal Service — packages.\\xa0 And I don’t know why they’re not — you know, I don’t run the Postal Service.\\xa0 You have a group of people, so-called “independent” people, and they run it.\\n\\nBut these packages are — they deliver — they lose money every time they deliver a package for Amazon or these other Internet companies, these other companies that deliver.\\xa0 They drop everything in the Post Office and they say, “You deliver it.”\\xa0 And if they’d raise the prices by actually a lot, then you’d find out that the Post Office could make money or break even.\\xa0 But they don’t do that.\\xa0 And I’m trying to figure out why.\\n\\nThese are independent boards.\\xa0 They were appointed by other administrations.\\xa0 They’re, sort of, long term.\\xa0 They’re there for a long time.\\xa0 And I’ve been talking to them also.\\xa0 You can look it up.\\xa0 Take a look.\\xa0 They should raise — they have to raise the prices to these companies that walk in and drop\\xa0thousands of packages on the floor of the Post Office and say, “Deliver it.”\\xa0 And they make money, but the Post Office gets killed.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 So they ought to do that, and we’re looking into it.\\xa0 And we’ve been pushing them now for over a year.\\n\\nAnd you know that because you’ve seen the stories.\\xa0 I’m pushing them.\\xa0 It’s not fair for them to — these great, wonderful, modern companies, they walk into our old Post Office with all these routes that could never be built; you could never build them.\\xa0 They go into areas that you could never do, and they say, “Here.\\xa0 Deliver this.”\\xa0 And they lose a lot of money per package.\\xa0 And they have to raise their prices, but this Postal Commission doesn’t do it.\\xa0 Now, we just got a chance to appoint a couple of people onto the Commission, as I understand it, and that’s good.\\xa0 But they have to raise their prices; otherwise, they’re just going to lose a lot of money.\\n\\nAnd tell your Democrat friend that he ought to focus on that, because if he focused on that, he could truly save the Post Office.\\xa0 The Post Office has been losing billions of dollars a year for many, many years.\\xa0 And have him take a look at that, because that’s the way to solve the problem.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you so much, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah. \\xa0Please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you so much.\\xa0 Mr. President, you say this week will be very painful, very difficult.\\xa0 But a few weeks ago, you said this was just like a flu.\\xa0 What have you learned —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I didn’t say two weeks ago it was a flu.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A few weeks ago.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No — you know what?\\xa0 Can I tell you what?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The question is, Mr. President, what have you learned —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Excuse me.\\xa0 Ready?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — that you could offer as advice to foreign leaders who are still skeptical about this pandemic and who are against social distancing?\\xa0 What is your advice?\\xa0 What have you learned?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 You said I said it was just like a flu.\\n\\nSo the worst pandemic we ever had in this world was a flu, and it was called — you know that.\\xa0 It was in 1917, 1918.\\xa0 And anywhere from 50- to 100 million people died.\\xa0 That was a flu, okay?\\xa0 So, you could say that I said it was a flu or you could say — the flu is nothing to sneeze at.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But my question, Mr. President: What can you offer as advice to foreign leaders who are skeptical about this pandemic and who are against social distancing?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think there aren’t too many of them.\\xa0 If you look throughout the world, and everyone — just about everyone that has practiced that is now closing up.\\xa0 Well, the U.K. was an example.\\n\\nNow, they talk about Sweden, but Sweden is suffering very gravely.\\xa0 You know that, right?\\xa0 Sweden did that.\\xa0 “The herd.”\\xa0 They call it “the herd.”\\xa0 Sweden is suffering very, very badly.\\xa0 It’s a way of doing it, but the — you know, everybody has been watching everybody else.\\xa0 And so far, almost every country has done it the way we’ve done it — we’ve chosen to do it.\\xa0 If we didn’t do it that way, we would have lost hundreds of thousands of more people.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, there’s voting going on today in Wisconsin.\\xa0 There were reports of thousands of people waiting in hours-long lines as they’ve had to weigh their own personal health and their civic responsibility.\\xa0 What — do think that the Supreme Court was right in its decision, sir, that voting should go forward and that the absentee extension should not take place?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Of course they were right.\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Look, the Supreme Court — well, of course they were right, because what the Democrats wanted — and you know why this happened.\\xa0 I supported a man named Justice Kelly, who’s — Daniel Kelly, highly respected justice.\\xa0 And I supported him just the other day — social media.\\xa0 I know of him.\\xa0 He’s a — just a, you know, fantastic judge, justice.\\xa0 And I endorsed him.\\n\\nAnd as soon as I endorsed him, they wanted to move the election.\\xa0 They didn’t want to move the election.\\xa0 As soon as I endorsed him, the Wisconsin Democrats say, “Oh, let’s move the election to two months later.”\\xa0 They didn’t mind having the election until I endorsed him, which is very interesting.\\n\\nNow they talk about, “Oh, safety, safety.”\\xa0 Well, it was 15 minutes after I put out an endorsement that they said, “We have to move the election.”\\xa0 They didn’t want to move the election before that.\\xa0 The other thing they wanted to do — which is crazy — at the end of the election, they wanted to have one week for proxies to come in or mailed ballots.\\n\\nNow, mail ballots — they cheat.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 People cheat.\\xa0 Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country, because they’re cheaters.\\xa0 They go and collect them.\\xa0 They’re fraudulent in many cases.\\xa0 You got to vote.\\xa0 And they should have voter ID, by the way.\\xa0 If you want to really do it right, you have voter ID.\\n\\nBut the Democrats — and this was turned over in the Supreme Court yesterday; I give great credit to the court — they actually didn’t want to have an Election Day.\\xa0 They wanted to have Election Day, and then a week after Election Day, you choose your cand- — but all of these ballots come in.\\xa0 These mailed ballots come in.\\xa0 The mailed ballots are corrupt, in my opinion.\\xa0 And they collect them, and they get people to go in and sign them.\\xa0 And then they — they’re forgeries in many cases.\\xa0 It’s a horrible thing.\\n\\nAnd so what happened is, the Democrats in Wisconsin, they had no problem with the election being today, until I endorsed the Republican candidate, Justice Kelly — Daniel Kelly.\\xa0 And as soon as I endorsed him, they went crazy.\\xa0 They went crazy.\\xa0 And you know that’s true.\\xa0 And now all of a sudden —\\n\\nBecause — go back two weeks, go back two days: They didn’t want to move the election.\\xa0 They were having the election.\\xa0 They were fine because they thought they were going to win the election.\\xa0 Then I endorsed him, and all of a sudden they think they’re not.\\xa0 Now I understand there are lines that go back a long way.\\xa0 I hope they’re going to vote for Justice Kelly.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0With millions of pills of hydroxychloroquine donated, is there a plan or system in place —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — to track the potential side effects?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There have been reports —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, you saw the representative —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — of serious harm.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Look — look, is there a plan that —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So is there a plan to track the side effects of the clinical trials?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The side effects?\\xa0 The side effects are the least of it.\\xa0 You have people dying all over the place.\\xa0 And generally, the side effects are really with the Z-Pak having to do with the heart.\\xa0 The Z-Pak — that’s the antibiotic.\\xa0 Not with the hydroxychloroquine.\\n\\nSo, a woman last night — I watched her on one of the shows — a good show; Laura — and she was — she thought she was dead.\\xa0 She was a representative from Michigan.\\xa0 She was just in horrible shape for 12 days, 14 days.\\xa0 She thought she was dead.\\xa0 I think she said that her doctor said she’s — you know, it’s going to be very tough.\\n\\nShe saw me talking about this, and she asked her husband to go to the drugstore.\\xa0 Now, this is a Democrat representative — a person that, you know, perhaps wouldn’t be voting for me.\\xa0 I think she’ll be voting for me now, even if she’s a Democrat, even if she’s a Democrat representative.\\n\\nAnd they went to the store — which I made available, because we have millions of doses.\\xa0 We have, I think, 29 million doses of this drug.\\xa0 And she asked her husband.\\xa0 She said, “Please go out.\\xa0 I’m not going to make it.”\\xa0 You have to hear her story.\\xa0 “Please go out.\\xa0 Get it.”\\xa0 He went at 10 o’clock in the evening to the drugstore.\\xa0 He got it.\\xa0 He gave it to her.\\n\\nNow, you know, it’s — I don’t say it works like this at all.\\xa0 Four hours later, she awoke and she said, “I feel better.”\\xa0 And then shortly thereafter, she felt great.\\xa0 This a woman that thought she was going to die.\\xa0 It’s — I mean, she’s a Democrat representative, a highly respected woman, African American woman.\\xa0 I don’t know if you saw it.\\xa0 You asked a question about African American.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I did — I did see.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 She was an African American woman.\\xa0 A great woman.\\xa0 Her manner of speaking, her — the way she told the story was beautiful.\\xa0 “I asked my husband to go and get it.\\xa0 He got it.”\\n\\nShe is now okay.\\xa0 I mean, she was interviewed last night on television.\\xa0 And she thanked me.\\xa0 She thanked me even in a tweet.\\xa0 She said, “I want to thank President Trump.\\xa0 He saved my life.”\\n\\nLook, I don’t say that happens with everybody, but that’s a beautiful story.\\xa0 There are many of those stories.\\xa0 And I say, “Try it.”\\n\\nOkay, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I mean, if you’re in trouble, if you’re going to die and you’re going to die — I mean, it’s — you’re not going to die from this pill.\\xa0 Now, there could be some side effects, but the side effects is really more so from the Z-Pak.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is there a plan to track those side effects?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no — doctors have to recommend it.\\xa0 I want doctors — I’m not saying — I’m not a doctor. \\xa0I’m just saying, we hear great results.\\xa0 And some people say, “Let’s go to a laboratory.\\xa0 Let’s test it for a couple of years.\\xa0 And then…”\\xa0 No, I got — we got people dying in this country and all over the world, right now, not in a couple of years.\\xa0 They’re dying.\\xa0 As we speak, there are people dying.\\n\\nAnd I really think it’s a great thing to try, just based on what I know.\\xa0 Again, I’m not a doctor.\\xa0 And I say, “Get a physician’s approval.”\\xa0 And they have physicians in these hospitals.\\xa0 Great physicians.\\xa0 Brave physicians.\\xa0 They also say it’s good for the hospital workers to take them.\\xa0 That it’s — you know, it’s a — it keeps it away.\\xa0 Keeps it out of your system.\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 But there’s a lot of good examples.\\n\\nAnd, you know, we have a 1,500-case study going in New York and it’s almost complete.\\xa0 So it’ll be very interesting to see what happens.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you sir.\\xa0 Can you that —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But I appreciate that woman.\\xa0 She was great.\\xa0 You have to see it to believe it.\\xa0 The way she spoke, it was like a miracle.\\xa0 And this was not a fan of mine, but she’s a fan of mine now, and I’m very honored by it.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 Can you talk about your decision to remove Glenn Fine from the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee?\\xa0 And there’s some — that move and some of the criticism you’ve leveled at IGs, how does the American public have confidence that —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — there’ll be oversight?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we have a IGs in from the Obama era.\\xa0 And as you know, it’s a presidential decision.\\xa0 And I left them, largely.\\xa0 I may change some, but I left them.\\n\\nBut when we have, you know, reports of bias and when we have different things coming in — I don’t know Fine; I don’t think I ever met Fine.\\xa0 I heard the name —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 He wasn’t an Obama —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I heard the name.\\xa0 I don’t know where he is.\\xa0 Maybe he was from Clinton.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 You have to check that out?\\xa0 Okay, maybe he’s from Clinton.\\n\\nBut we did change him, but we changed a number.\\xa0 We have about seven nominations in.\\xa0 I believe we put seven very, very highly qualified people for the IG position.\\xa0 And, you know, that’s a decision that I could have made three years ago and I could have made two years ago.\\xa0 But we’re putting in — not so much for him.\\xa0 We’re putting in seven names.\\xa0 I think it was seven.\\xa0 And they’re going in now.\\n\\nYeah.\\xa0 Steve?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 When you talk about the WHO being “China-centric,” what exactly are you talking about?\\xa0 Is it because China has underplayed how many victims they’ve had?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know, they seem to come down on the side of China: “Don’t close your borders to China.\\xa0 Don’t do this.”\\xa0 They don’t report what’s really going on.\\xa0 They didn’t see it, and yet they were there.\\xa0 They didn’t see what was going on in Wuhan.\\xa0 They didn’t see it.\\xa0 How do you not see it?\\xa0 They didn’t see it.\\xa0 They didn’t report it if they did see it.\\xa0 They must have seen it, but they didn’t report it.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, just turning back to the voting in Wisconsin and those long lines: Who will be responsible and who should be held responsible if people get sick after they voted?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Look, all I did was endorse a candidate.\\xa0 I don’t know anything about their lines.\\xa0 I don’t know anything about their voting.\\xa0 I love the state.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But you also encouraged people to get —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I won the state.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — out and vote today as well.\\xa0 Will you take some of —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — the responsibility if some of those people get sick?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I won the state, which is rare for a Republican to do, but I want the state of Wisconsin.\\xa0 I’m going to win it again because we’ve been great to the people of Wisconsin, as you know, with our policies.\\xa0 And they like me and I like them.\\n\\nBut all I did was endorse a candidate that’s highly qualified — a very respected person — and all hell broke loose as soon as I did that.\\n\\nAnd then all of a sudden, they want to change.\\xa0 Before I endorsed him, they didn’t want to change this voting area.\\xa0 There was no problem with the Democrats voting until I endorsed the candidate.\\xa0 Then they said, “Let’s move it two months, let’s move it three months later.”\\xa0 “Safety, safety, safety,” right?\\xa0 All of a sudden, they want safety.\\xa0 Well, before I did the endorsement, they didn’t talk about safety.\\xa0 It was fine for months.\\xa0 For months, it was fine.\\xa0 It was always going to be.\\n\\nAnd now I endorse, and they want safety.\\xa0 So, you know, that sounds —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, on the economy, sir —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, can I follow on that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Just to follow up on that, how does the election — them holding this election in Wisconsin line up with the social distancing recommendations that have come from your administration?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, there you’ll have to ask the people — that you have a Democrat in Wisconsin as governor.\\xa0 Ask him.\\xa0 That’s his problem.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 He should be doing it.\\n\\nAgain, some governors fail.\\xa0 And I won’t let them fail, because when they fail, I’ll help.\\xa0 But that’s run by Democrats right now.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 It’s run by Democrats.\\xa0 You had a great Republican —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But is it possible to socially distance when you’re voting?\\xa0 You’re going to have crowds.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You’ll have to speak to the governor.\\xa0 What you should do is call the governor of Wisconsin and ask him that question.\\xa0 But also ask him how come it was okay to do this until I endorsed a candidate?\\xa0 And as soon as I endorsed him, these lines are formed.\\xa0 And I hear, Mike, the lines are through the roof.\\xa0 So, you know, hopefully they’re going to wrote — they’re going to vote for the right candidate.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, can I just check in on oil again today?\\xa0 I was wondering if —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oil?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, if there’s —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Where is it today?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, I was wondering if you had —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no, where is the price?\\xa0 Give me the price.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m not sure, to be honest.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 How can you ask a question when you don’t know the price?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’ll look it up for you.\\xa0 Uh —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, let me do somebody else then.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you were highly critical of mail-in voting — mailing your mail-in ballots for voting a few minutes ago.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think mail-in voting is horrible.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But you voted by mail in —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s corrupt.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — Florida’s election last month, didn’t you?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure, I can vote by mail for the —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So how do you reconcile that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Because I’m allowed to.\\xa0 Well, that’s called “out of state.”\\xa0 You know, why I voted?\\xa0 Because I happen to be in the White House and I won’t be able to go to Florida to vote.\\n\\nBut let me just say —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So what is the difference between mailing within state and mailing outside the state?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, there’s a big difference between somebody that’s out of state and does a ballot and everything is sealed, certified, and everything else.\\xa0 You see what you have to do with the certifications.\\xa0 And you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody’s living room, signing ballots all over the place.\\n\\nNo, I think that mail-in voting is a terrible thing.\\xa0 I think if you vote, you should go.\\xa0 And even the concept of early voting is not the greatest because a lot of things happen, but it’s okay.\\xa0 But you should go and you should vote.\\xa0 I think you should go and you should vote.\\n\\nYou look at what they do, where they grab thousands of mail-in ballots and they dump it.\\xa0 I’ll tell you what — and I don’t have to tell; you can look at the statistics — there’s a lot of dishonesty going along with mail-in voting — mail-in ballots.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you’ve heard state officials that buy their own medical equipment, but federal officials are kind of swooping in and scooping up those orders.\\xa0 How are you ensuring that —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s not right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — it’s being distributed fairly —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’ve been hearing that so long.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and there’s going to be more transparency?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re getting — we’re getting great prices on equipment.\\xa0 We’re getting great prices on equipment, and we’re helping the states.\\xa0 And the governors are very thankful.\\xa0 Mike Pence had a call yesterday with — every governor was on the call and every — it was like a lovefest.\\xa0 They’re very happy.\\xa0 I don’t know if they tell that to the press.\\xa0 Some of them don’t.\\xa0 Some of them will never say good to the press, but they know we’ve done a great job.\\xa0 Not a good job, a great job.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So are you saying it’s not happening?\\xa0 Because state officials are widely saying that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no, I think sometimes it does, and what we say is, let us know and we will immediately drop out of the bidding.\\xa0 Let us know.\\xa0 And we do that and we drop out.\\xa0 Sometimes we tell them to drop out because we’ve got a good price.\\xa0 You — and then we’ll deliver it to them.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How do you ensure it’s —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, go ahead, behind, please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no, no, no, not you.\\xa0 In front, please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Some states have had trouble with getting accurate death counts, particularly because of lack of testing or no uniform —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Did you say “death counts”?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 Because of lack of testing and no uniform system to put that into.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know — when you say, “death counts,” I think they’re pretty accurate on the death count.\\xa0 When somebody dies, I think the states have been pretty accurate.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But if there’s no testing —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s a big deal, what you’re just saying, right?\\xa0 No, the death counts, I think they’re very, very accurate.\\n\\nI do say this: I think if you look at China and if you look at some of these very large countries, when you talk about cases — number of cases — I would be willing to bet they have more cases than we do, but they don’t do the testing like we do.\\xa0 But you look at, you know, other — if you look at some of these certain countries, and I would be willing to bet a lot that they had — have more cases.\\xa0 But we’re more accurate and our testing is done very accurately, and we’ve got a good process.\\n\\nDid you have one?\\xa0 Yes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you have —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 OAN.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — you have been very consistently supportive of the payroll relief tax.\\xa0 And I know that —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Of what?\\xa0 Payroll?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Payroll relief.\\xa0 Now, I know you’re still busy trying to implement — roll —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — phase three.\\xa0 But as we move towards phase four —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — are there still obstacles to that?\\xa0 Because that would put money in American pockets, like consistently throughout the year.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, you’re right.\\xa0 I would love to see a payroll — good question.\\xa0 I would love to see a payroll tax cut.\\xa0 And I think, on behalf of the people, it would be quick.\\xa0 Now, it’s a longer term — you know, it’s a longer time, because it’s over a period of a year or whatever you want to make it.\\xa0 But I would love to see a payroll tax cut.\\xa0 There are many people that would like to see it as a permanent tax cut — payroll tax cut.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What is stopping it from —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, the Democrats right now are stopping it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What are their reasons?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 You know, I don’t know if maybe they think it’s good politics to stop it.\\n\\nBut you’d get a lot of people a lot of money immediately.\\xa0 The payroll tax cut would be a great thing for this country.\\xa0 I would like to have it regardless of this, but this would be a fantastic time to have the payroll tax cut.\\n\\nThe Democrats are stopping it, but I don’t think they’re — you know, I think it’s — I think there’s a certain flexibility.\\xa0 I think it’s something that we should do both for business and the people.\\n\\nBut this would get money into the hands of small business immediately, money in the hands of people — the workers and people — immediately.\\xa0 And it would be over an extended period.\\xa0 And it would be simple to do.\\xa0 It’s so easy to do.\\xa0 It’s a great tax cut, and I’d love you to speak to the Democrats, and let’s get it done.\\n\\nSo I’m going to give this now to Vice President Pence, and they’re going to go over some very good statistics with everybody.\\n\\nAnd we’ll have a couple of answers on that, because we’re working very hard on the African American community with respect to what’s going on because it’s not — it’s not good.\\xa0 I don’t like it.\\xa0 And we’re going to have some very good statistics, Tony, I think over the next couple of days.\\n\\nSo thank you all very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you all.\\xa0 A few updates and then I’ll — I’ll introduce Dr. Deborah Birx to talk about what we’re seeing around the country, what the data is telling us.\\n\\nBut suffice it to say, as the President said several times, this is a very tough week in America.\\xa0 And our hearts go out to all of the families that have lost loved ones to the coronavirus.\\xa0 But I know I speak for the entire White House Coronavirus Task Force when I say our hearts are with the people of the Greater New York City area today.\\n\\nAs we stand here today, in the midst of heartbreaking numbers of losses in New York City, I also want to assure the American people that there — there’s reason for hope.\\xa0 As — as Dr. Birx will enumerate in just a few moments, despite the increase in losses, as Governor Cuomo articulated today, hospital admissions continue to decline.\\n\\nAnd in our report early this morning from Dr. Birx, we continue to see evidence of stabilization in some of the areas around the country of the most significant outbreak.\\xa0 The New York metro area, including New Jersey, Long Island, and Connecticut; New Orleans metro area; Detroit; Boston; Chicago; and Denver — as Dr. Birx will explain — continue to give evidence of stabilization, which, in a very real sense, is evidence that the American people are putting into practice the social distancing, the President’s guidelines for our nation.\\n\\nAnd for that, as the President said earlier today, we thank the American people.\\xa0 Even in the midst of hardship and loss at a time when we’ve seen more than 385,000 Americans test positive for the coronavirus and more than and more than 12,000 succumb to this illness.\\n\\nThe evidence that Dr. Birx will describe to you will show that the American people know our future is in our hands.\\xa0 And so, as I begin, allow me just simply to continue to urge every American to put into practice the guidance you’re receiving from your state and local authorities.\\xa0 Take it to heart, take it seriously, share it with your family and your friends, and — and — and know that you’re making a difference, America, because you truly are.\\n\\nToday, for my part, I spoke to over 500 small-business owners in a conference call.\\xa0 And there, I heard about their enthusiasm for the Paycheck Protection Program.\\xa0 And that call took place before the President had the Secretary of Treasury indicate our interest in acquiring another $250 billion for that program.\\n\\nAs of this morning, more than $60 billion in forgivable loans that would cover two months of paychecks at small businesses had already been distributed and the number is going to grow, literally, by the day.\\n\\nBut we also had a very productive call today with — with some other American heroes.\\xa0 You know, the — we all have in our hearts and in our minds our healthcare workers.\\xa0 And I’ll speak for a moment about the supplies and resources that we’re working to provide for all of them.\\n\\nBut right below our healthcare workers are all the people that are working in critical infrastructure around the country and — and some of the most important people are working in food supply.\\xa0 I mean, from — from the farmers and the ranchers, to our processors, to our distributors, to our truckers, to our grocers, Americans are keeping food on the table for our fellow Americans.\\n\\nAnd let me begin by just saying what I said to some of the most prominent CEOs of the meat and grain industry companies in the country — companies like Tyson Foods and Hormel — today: Not just these companies, but to all the hardworking people working in food supply today, thank you.\\xa0 Thank you for what you’re doing to keep those grocery store shelves stocked.\\xa0 Thank you for showing up for work every day and — and working hard to keep that food supply rolling in America.\\n\\nYou know, it was more than five weeks ago that the President brought in all of the — all the grocery store leaders in the country.\\xa0 And there he received a commitment that no grocery store in America would close, and they haven’t.\\n\\nBut it’s been these heroic Americans, from the farm to the fork, that have made it possible for Americans to have one less worry.\\xa0 And they are truly inspiring heroes.\\n\\nNow, that being said, I did hear from the industry today that there have been reports of some plants having reduced capacity because of people having concerns about exposure to the coronavirus.\\xa0 In fact, over the last several days, there’s been some incidents of worker absenteeism and some plants have actually been forced to close temporarily.\\n\\nAnd so, on behalf of the President, on behalf of our entire team, and on behalf of a grateful nation, let me just say to all of you that are working in the food industry at every level across the country: Just understand that you are vital.\\xa0 You are giving a great service to the people of the United States of America.\\xa0 And we need you to continue, as a part of what we call our critical infrastructure, to show up and do your job and know that we’re going to continue to work tirelessly in working with all of your companies to make sure that that workplace is safe.\\n\\nWith that being said, let me talk about the other heroes that we always mention at this podium today, that Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci invariably mentioned, and that’s our healthcare workers.\\xa0 At the President’s direction, we’ve been working tirelessly — literally around the clock to identify resources around the country and around the world to make sure our healthcare workers have the support that they need.\\n\\nWith some 51 major disaster declarations — most recently, Minnesota — being approved, states have stood up 27,000 National Guard.\\xa0 But personnel-wise, before the end of business today, there will be more than 3,000 Department of Defense and Health and Human Service medical personnel on the ground in the Greater New York City area.\\xa0 And those people will be redeployed once that region of the country moves through the coronavirus epidemic in that area.\\xa0 And — and we salute those extraordinary, patriotic Americans for stepping forward to bring real relief to our healthcare workers.\\n\\nWith regard to equipment, Admiral Polowczyk reported to the task force throughout the course of the day today that we have continued to distribute ventilators across the country.\\xa0 We’re — we’re sending additional ventilators from the Strategic National Stockpile.\\xa0 Maryland will receive 50 ventilators, Delaware will receive 50 ventilators, and that will leave more than 8,400 ventilators still in the National Stockpile.\\n\\nOne correction from yesterday: After our press briefing yesterday, FEMA made a different decision with regard to what the State of California generously made available.\\xa0 And the ventilators — some 500 ventilators that we, again, want to thank Governor Gavin Newsom and the people of California for donating to our nation’s efforts — 100 of those are being deployed to New York, 100 in New Jersey, 100 to Illinois, 50 to Maryland, 50 to Washington, D.C., 50 to Delaware, and 50 to Nevada.\\n\\nWith regard to the remainder of what we call personal protective equipment, again, we’ve been literally leaving no stone unturned anywhere in the country or anywhere around the world.\\xa0 And as Admiral Polowczyk described just a couple of days ago, we’ve established not just an air bridge, but a control tower system modeled after military logistics out of FEMA.\\n\\nAnd while — while FEMA is acquiring a small portion of — of what’s being acquired, 90 percent of the suppliers are being — are being routed directly into our massive distribution system.\\xa0 And FEMA is using the data that Dr. Birx provides to target those resources to the areas most in need.\\n\\nI asked them to break out a few details about resources that just in the last five days have been distributed.\\xa0 And I hope it’s an encouragement to healthcare workers all across these regions and around the country about the efforts that are being made to make sure they have what they need.\\n\\nYou can see the New York metro area, including New Jersey, just in the last five days, more than 6 million N95 masks, more than 6 million surgical masks.\\xa0 When Governor Cuomo and I last spoke, he told me there was a real challenge for medical gowns in the New York City area and in New Jersey as well.\\xa0 And 2.8 million gowns were distributed to that region as well.\\n\\nGoing next to New Orleans, where — again, while we see some encouragement, challenges remain in that community.\\xa0 Some 837,000 N95 masks for healthcare workers, 165 surgical masks, other items, including almost 6 million gloves have been distributed.\\n\\nDetroit continues to be a real focal point.\\xa0 We’re working closely with Governor Gretchen Whitmer, as well as Mayor Mike Duggan, to meet the needs of healthcare workers in Detroit.\\xa0 Just in the last five days, 1.6 million N95 masks have been routed into the healthcare system in Detroit, nearly 700,000 surgical masks, and 24 million gloves — just as a portion of what’s displayed.\\n\\nAnd in the Chicago metro area, which we continue to focus on each and every day, more than 1.7 million N95 masks have been routed into their healthcare system, 900,000 surgical masks, 25 million gloves.\\n\\nI share these details in the hopes that healthcare workers looking on will be encouraged.\\xa0 At the President’s direction, we are — we are making every effort to make sure you have the resources you need to do your job, to do it safely, and to go home safe to your family, even while you provide that extraordinary and courageous care that our healthcare workers are providing literally around the clock in the midst of the coronavirus challenge.\\n\\nThe last slide is just the cumulative numbers that we have distributed.\\xa0 And I’m happy, in a few moments, to answer any questions about that.\\n\\nAgain, the system that we have in place is one that is essentially infusing our major distribution networks with millions of items.\\xa0 And then FEMA is directing, on a day-by-day and oftentimes hour-by-hour basis, where those resources are most needed.\\xa0 And we’ll continue to do that as the coronavirus makes its way through these communities and through communities that are very much on our watch list today.\\n\\nAnd let me just lastly say that, again, I want to thank the American people for stepping up and doing your part.\\xa0 We continue to be overwhelmed with one story after another, where people are doing social distancing, where people are looking after one another, where they’re checking in with a phone call to an elderly friend, a family member to make sure they’re okay.\\n\\nI mean, we are on the front end of “30 Days to Slow the Spread.”\\xa0 And I will tell you, as a non-scientist up here, that I see glimmers of hope in the early numbers that we’re seeing come out of the Greater New York City area, in New Jersey, even New Orleans, and Detroit, and Chicago.\\xa0 There does appear to be, as Dr. Birx will explain in more detail — there does appear to be evidence of leveling, evidence of progress.\\n\\nBut this is exactly the time for all of us to redouble our efforts to do everything each and every one of us can, not just to protect our own health and that of our family and our loved ones, but to do our part to ensure that we lessen the impact of the coronavirus on America as a whole, but — but even more importantly, that we — that we lessen the impact on lives by ensuring that we do our part to make sure that no one that is vulnerable is unnecessarily exposed to this virus.\\n\\nWith that, let me yield to Dr. Birx and then Seema Verma and Dr. Fauci.\\xa0 And we’ll take all your questions.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 So, hopefully, you can see from those numbers that we’ve taken a data-detailed approach, really bringing the power of granular data to the supply chain and moving supplies based on really what you would call “burden of disease” and need.\\n\\nIf I could just take — start out by not just going to the numbers at the beginning, but really talking to the community of health advocates, to the community that works on the social determinants of disease, and the communities of historic black colleges and universities: We really need to improve messaging.\\xa0 And I’m asking them to help us increase the messaging around this.\\n\\nWe don’t want to give the impression that the African American community is more susceptible to the virus; we don’t have any data that suggests that.\\xa0 What our data suggests is they are more susceptible to more difficult and severe disease and poorer outcomes.\\n\\nAnd we really need to make sure that every household is aware of what it’s going to take to protect the individuals in that household that have pre-existing conditions.\\xa0 We could call on the indigenous nations, the tribal leaders to also be working very closely to protect the elders of their communities.\\n\\nWe know this is more difficult in multi-generational households.\\xa0 And it’s really going to call for really unbelievable attention to details — of hand washing and protecting others from each other — particularly if you don’t feel well.\\n\\nThis is really a call to action to the communities to make sure that we get messages appropriately out there so that everyone understands what it’s going to take for us all to protect one another.\\xa0 And we know it can be done because we can see these changes.\\xa0 I wanted to go through the numbers at a high level so you understand why particularly these supplies went to these areas to begin with.\\n\\nWe talk about attack rates or the cases per population.\\xa0 So in the New York — as a state, they have seven cases per thousand.\\xa0 This is the highest in the country.\\xa0 In New York City itself, it’s closer to almost twice that — in New York City.\\n\\nNew Jersey is four per thousand; Louisiana, three per thousand; Massachusetts, two per thousand; Connecticut, two per thousand; Michigan, 1.5 per thousand; the District of Columbia and the Baltimore area now 1.5 per thousand, and we’re watching them very closely; Pennsylvania, one per thousand, but we’re concerned about Philadelphia.\\n\\nWhat is allowing us to move supplies based on burden of disease and need is the extraordinary West Coast that has had very low numbers.\\xa0 From Washington, that was less than one per thousand; California, that is less than 0.5 per thousand; and Oregon, that’s even less than that.\\n\\nAnd it’s those states where there’s large populations — because of the enormous work that they’re doing to prevent expansion and spread of the virus, it’s allowing resources to go to these — these states and these communities and these counties that need more support.\\n\\nAnd so this kind of data analysis is allowing us to make very intelligent decisions about need, but also really understanding what’s happening across the country in the development of the curves, as you have heard about.\\n\\nAnd so we do see — and I know you heard me caution that, over the weekend, sometimes there’s decreased case reporting.\\xa0 And so there were increases in a series of communities on Monday.\\xa0 We’re seeing that stabilize again.\\xa0 And when you look over three days, you’re starting to see that we may be actually — in a series of communities outside of New York and New Jersey and Connecticut — creating a much flatter graph.\\xa0 A most — a much flatter curve.\\n\\nSo you saw New York and their increase.\\xa0 And then you saw — we’re hoping, as — as Governor Cuomo and May- — and the mayor has described that they’re getting to a steady state, where the next outcome is going down.\\n\\nBut we see across the country — in Detroit, in Chicago — some real — not this extreme, going to seven cases per thousand, but really staying in the more two cases per thousand.\\xa0 And a different curve parameter than — and it really shows the amazing, amazing activity of every American in those cities to really ensure that there’s social distancing and, really importantly, to ensure there is less socialization between households and really ensuring that the household really remains independent and protected, and not really, at this moment, going out into the community or socializing anywhere, but a virtual way — on computers, by Zoom, by FaceTime.\\xa0 And I think we can really see that in the data and it’s really given us great heart.\\n\\nI want to finish by really talking to my laboratory directors, because you’re extraordinary and you’ve done an amazing amount of testing.\\xa0 Those nearly 2 million tests that we’re getting to, those were all done in the last two to three weeks.\\xa0 But we do have ex- — excess capacity.\\xa0 So if all the lab directors could look in their laboratories, if they have an Abbott m2000, if they could get that up and running, we could double the number of tests that we’re doing per day.\\xa0 That is a high-throughput.\\xa0 The machines are throughout the United States.\\xa0 There’s hundreds of them.\\xa0 Right now, about 80 percent of them are idle.\\xa0 We’re going to have a call with the laboratory directors of these laboratories to really ensure that this is an automated, robotic situation that they can run.\\n\\nThere’s over a million tests sitting tests — test kits sitting ready to be run.\\xa0 We have five platforms of test.\\xa0 This is one of our really high-volume platforms, like Roche.\\xa0 And we’re really calling on them to really increase that capacity so that we can do not only increase diagnostic testing, which I think we’re doing quite well right now, but also increasing the ability to do more healthcare workers, first responders, community testing, and surveillance.\\n\\nAnd so — and then finally, you will see — and you’ve heard about it happening in the U.K. and other places — there’s a series of antibody tests out there that have not been validated.\\xa0 We’re working right now very closely with a series of companies that know how to make these tests, that have made these tests for us for decades, for HIV, for a rapid test.\\xa0 They’re working on that technology to bring that quality of test, which is in the 90-plus percent sensitivity and specificity, to the American people for antibody tests.\\n\\nBut before — until we get those, if you see them on the Internet, do not buy them until we can give you a test that’s reliable for all Americans.\\xa0 And we are working very hard to have that happen and bring that to the American public.\\xa0 Some of the tests that may be available on the Internet may have very low sensitivity and specificity and give you a false reassurance that you either — give you a false positive or a false negative, implying that you may be protected.\\n\\nSo please wait until we have those tests available and validated.\\xa0 People are working around the clock to make those available to the American people.\\xa0 We all understand how important that is because you’ve heard us talk about asymptomatic cases.\\xa0 And we really want to know how broad that is and how common that is.\\n\\nAnd so in places like New York City, where I described that they had seven per thousand — sometimes two, three and four times any other place in the United States — being able to know what the number of people who never had symptoms but do have a positive test would be really critical at this point, particularly as we plan for any reoccurrence in the fall or in future seasons.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Great.\\xa0 And we have Seema Verma with the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services — will discuss what we’ve done to support hospitals.\\xa0 As we support healthcare workers, we’re going to make sure the institutions that are providing the environment for care are well financed.\\xa0 And she’s got a couple of funding streams, and help is on the way.\\n\\nSeema?\\n\\nADMINISTRATOR VERMA:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 And let me just start with echoing the President and the Vice President’s comments about our condolences to all the people out there that have lost somebody to the coronavirus.\\xa0 And also, you know, sincere appreciation and thanks to all our healthcare workers that are on the frontlines.\\n\\nBut we know that it’s — the impact on the healthcare system isn’t just those front care — frontline workers.\\xa0 Healthcare organizations across the nation are having increased expenses.\\xa0 They’re having to spend more on supplies.\\xa0 You’re seeing all of the supplies that are being sent to them.\\xa0 And that’s having a direct impact on their — on their bottom line.\\n\\nMany of them are also having increased expenses because they’re taking advantage of some of the flexibilities that we’ve given them.\\xa0 Hospitals without walls, they’re putting — you may see tents out in their parking lots where they’re doing testing for screening.\\xa0 So they have a lot of increased expenses as well.\\n\\nOther healthcare organizations are not performing essential surgeries or other services.\\xa0 A lot of them are moving to telehealth, and that represents lost revenue for these healthcare organizations across the country.\\n\\nAnd so the President has asked us to — to address this issue.\\xa0 About 10 days ago, we put out something called “accelerated payments” that we do in the Medicare program, and it allows us to advance payments to providers based on their historical Medicare revenues that they receive.\\n\\nSo just in 10 days, we’ve been able to provide payments to providers.\\xa0 We had about 25,000 requests; we’ve processed about 70 percent of these.\\xa0 It’s happened in about five days.\\xa0 And the total on that is about $34 billion that we’ve managed to put into the healthcare system.\\n\\nBut those are essentially loans.\\xa0 The President has asked us to go further with this and to start the implementation of the CARES Act.\\xa0 That provides $100 billion to the healthcare system.\\n\\nYou’ve heard Secretary Azar talk about the focus on some of those dollars going towards the uninsured.\\xa0 But the President wants us to accelerate getting those dollars out.\\xa0 And so this week, we will be putting out another $30 billion, which are grants.\\xa0 This is going to be based on Medicare revenue.\\xa0 There are no strings attached.\\xa0 So the healthcare providers that are receiving these dollars can essentially spend that in any way that they see fit.\\n\\nAlso, this is going to be done in a very easy, simplified way.\\xa0 For many of our healthcare providers, we actually do direct deposit with them.\\xa0 And so those dollars will just go right into their bank accounts.\\xa0 For other providers, all it’s going to require is some very simple registration, and we’ll be able to give them that money as well.\\xa0 So we’re expecting that to happen this week.\\n\\nThe other thing to note is that this is not a first-come, first-serve basis because we’re basing this on their Medicare revenue.\\xa0 They will get these dollars.\\xa0 So even if it takes a few days, there shouldn’t be any panic in the system as well.\\n\\nThe other thing to recognize here is that our priority was on getting these dollars out as quickly as possible.\\xa0 We heard that from the many healthcare providers across the country that weighed in on this.\\xa0 They said the most important thing was to get these dollars out as quickly as possible.\\xa0 But we recognize that, in terms of getting these dollars out, because it’s based on Medicare revenues, there are providers out there — pediatricians, children’s hospitals, OB-GYNs, even our nursing homes — that a lot of their revenue comes from other sources — Medicaid or other payer sources.\\xa0 And so those organizations will be addressed in the second tranche of funding.\\xa0 And we’ll have a priority for these organizations and these types of healthcare providers.\\n\\nAlso, I just want to say — so together, between the loans that we’ve put out there with our accelerated payments and the $30 billion, that’s about $64 billion for the healthcare system this week alone.\\xa0 And so I think, again, this is part of our effort to support the healthcare system.\\xa0 And — and also just want to, again, say thank you to all our healthcare providers out on the frontlines.\\n\\nTo all Americans: The best thing that we can do to support our healthcare providers is to adhere to those guidelines around “30 Days to Slow the Spread.”\\xa0 That is the best thing that we can do to support our healthcare workers.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Dr. Fauci, please.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 I just want to make a brief comment to get back to the discussion about the health disparities in — in the African American community because it really is very important.\\xa0 And the reason I want to bring it up — because I couldn’t help sitting there reflecting about, sometimes, when you’re in the middle of a crisis like we are now with the coronavirus, it really does have — ultimately shine a very bright light on some of the real weaknesses and foibles in our society.\\n\\nAnd as some of you know, I’ve — the greater proportion of my professional career has been defined by HIV/AIDS.\\xa0 And if you go back then, during that period of time when there was extraordinary stigma, particularly against the gay community, and it was only when the world realized how the gay community responded to this outbreak with incredible courage and dignity and — and strength and activism, that — I think that really changed some of the stigma against the gay community, very much so.\\n\\nI see a similarity here, because health disparities have always existed for the African American community.\\xa0 But here again, with the crisis how it’s shining a bright light on how unacceptable that is.\\xa0 Because, yet again, when you have a situation like the coronavirus, they are suffering disproportionately.\\xa0 As Dr. Birx said correctly, it’s not that they’re getting infected more often; it’s that when they do get infected, their underlying medical conditions — the diabetes, the hypertension, the obesity, the asthma — those are the kind of things that wind them up in the ICU and ultimately give them a higher death rate.\\n\\nSo when all this is over — and, as we’ve said, it will end — we will get over coronavirus, but there will still be health disparities, which we really do need to address in the African American community.\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well said.\\xa0 Questions for our panel, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 For Mr. Vice President and then a question for Dr. Birx as well.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On the ventilator issue, with 8,400 of them in the stockpile and tens of thousands more coming, why are states like California and Washington needing to send ventilators to other states?\\xa0 And is that smart if they might need them later on?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I’m going to let Dr. Birx speak about what’s happening in California and Washington because it is a real credit to the people of both states and the leadership of both states to see the progress that we’ve made.\\n\\nWe continue to witness that the numbers where the outbreak began — we all remember when this first emerged in the Seattle area.\\xa0 The numbers continue to be steady and low.\\xa0 And what we’ve seen the governor of California do, what we saw the governor of Washington State do, and the governor of Oregon — where the coronavirus hasn’t arrived, to a large extent, in Oregon — I think is in keeping with the highest tradition of the American spirit.\\n\\nI mean, they’re — they are understanding what I think — I think Americans are understanding more and more that while we tend to think of this as one large curve, in our minds, for when it began in our country, and we long for the day that it will end, and we want to hasten that day by putting into practice all these mitigation efforts — that the reality is — what these experts have explained to this layperson is that what we’re actually going to witness is a number of small curves that will cumulatively mean that curve.\\n\\nAnd for — for Oregon, for Washington State, for California to recognize where the need is and then to partner with us and FEMA to make sure the resources are there at the time of the need and the point of the need, I think is really inspiring.\\n\\nBut, Dr. Birx, do you want to speak to that?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yeah, I want to be clear: We didn’t ask for their ventilators.\\xa0 They looked at their epidemiologic curves.\\xa0 These are — these states have amazing health commissioners.\\n\\nAnd I think when this is over, we’ll really be — all of the models were based on something we have never attempted to do anywhere in the world.\\xa0 We have never attempted to do this kind of mitigation.\\xa0 It was always theoretic to many individuals.\\xa0 And now we see, across the globe, people mitigating against this virus, realizing that their own behaviors can change the course and future of this virus in their communities, which is really astounding: the power that gives us to actually understand that we can compete against this virus and do well.\\n\\nAnd so I think their governors and their health commissioners looked at their curves, looked at their hospitals, looked at their ICU, and looked at their needs, and then decided that they didn’t need those at this time and wanted to make it available for other states that were in more of that two per thousand, three per thousand, four per thousand, and seven per thousand.\\xa0 And I think we’ll learn a lot from other states and other communities to really understand how to do this better next time.\\xa0 And I think this is what will teach us because we’ve never — we’ve never attempted anything like this, at least in my lifetime, where we’ve had, you know, these “30 Days to Stop the Spread.”\\xa0 I mean, we’ve not ever put out information like that.\\n\\nSo I think that — I think you heard the CDC Director talk earlier today about, in the models, how different individuals thought communities would mitigate and the rate at which they would mitigrate [sic] — mitigate.\\xa0 And I think you can see that, across the world, we’re learning that when you give communities the information that they need to understand what’s going on and you’re transparent, that communities can be part of the solution in a transparent and amazing way.\\n\\nAnd I think this kind of education and dialogue is always critical when you want communities — I think, when I first started here, five weeks ago, I said that we will win based on what the communities are able to do as a community of Americans.\\xa0 And I think we’re all really deeply impressed about what they were able to do.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Inspiring.\\xa0 Inspiring.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So it was the governors who decided.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And on the testing backlog, I just had a quick follow-up question on that.\\xa0 How close are we to getting into that 24-hour window you’ve talked about being very important?\\xa0 And then what is the status of the self-swap test?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So we’re tracking all of that very closely.\\xa0 I — and I — you know, I use my time here to appeal to people, specifically the health educators, the health advocates because I know the power with them.\\xa0 But to my lab directors, I really need the Abbott m2000 online, because that means we can do an extra 100,000 tests a day.\\xa0 And there’s enormous power in that.\\n\\nThe self-test — the ability to self-test, the ability — last time I had my test here, I self-tested.\\xa0 So it can be done; it’s straightforward.\\xa0 It works very well with that rapid five-minute test.\\n\\nBut what we now have to create — and I know that’s always difficult, because everybody wants one of something.\\xa0 We now have to create a mosaic that brings together where we know every single machine is in the United States, where our gaps are, and then align resources with need and gaps in the testing, and ensure that we have the right laboratory test for the right communities.\\n\\nSo you can see there would be communities, particularly the Indian Health Service and rural communities where that Abbott ID NOW kit could be incredibly helpful, because otherwise they’re shipping it all the way to a capital maybe three states away.\\xa0 And that’s going to add two or three days to the wait time, which we’re trying to get away from.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And is that where we’re at in the backlog, two or three days?\\xa0 Or how — what would you —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 Actually, it varies.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 It varies state by state.\\xa0 And we’ll be talking with all of the states —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It varies.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 — about really changing how we do testing in the community to really ensure that we’re testing optimally.\\xa0 Because right now, we have still focused very much on hospital diagnosis, because we know it will make a difference in treatment.\\n\\nSo these major laboratories are still putting drive-through tests at the back to all the hospital tests.\\xa0 And so that’s where the backlog is in the drive-through test.\\xa0 So I know if you’re an outpatient, not an inpatient — but if you’re an outpatient, that is where the delays right now are.\\xa0 But it’s state by state.\\xa0 And so some states have 24 hours or 48 hours for both their outpatients and inpatients.\\xa0 Others have short for inpatient and longer in outpatient.\\xa0 And we’re trying to reconcile those two pieces.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 And the team is actually meeting tonight to review that.\\xa0 But one of the data points that we review is literally, on a state-by-state basis, what the turnaround time is for testing.\\xa0 And we continue to work that.\\n\\nAnd these Abbott Laboratory devices are — there’s 18,000 of them across the country.\\xa0 When you go to your doctor office and get — get a strep test, it’s that device.\\xa0 All — all Abbott Laboratories has done, with strong and swift efforts of the FDA, is create a test to put in that for the coronavirus and that’s a 15-minute test.\\n\\nAnd so we — I want to renew our — our call to all the healthcare providers around the country is: Find your Abbott device and we’ll work our hearts out to get a test to you.\\n\\nHow about in the back corner?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Vice President, thank you.\\xa0 One for you and then one for either of the doctors, if you don’t mind.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 For you, sir: Back to this idea of reopening up the economy, since it’s not like there’s a switch that you can just turn it back on.\\xa0 How does the administration envision this happening?\\xa0 Is it guidance from the White House and you hope that governors follow it?\\xa0 Are you going to put it in the governors’ hands or the mayors’ hands?\\xa0 How do you envision all of that working together?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0 Well, the — the one thing I can assure you is that the President’s decision in that regard is going to be informed by what the data shows and about decisions about when we can responsibly reopen America and put America back to work.\\n\\nI can tell you the CDC will have new guidance tomorrow that the CDC will be publishing for people who were in proximity to an individual that tested positive for coronavirus but have no symptoms.\\xa0 And CDC will be publishing new guidance about how those individuals and the circumstances under which they might be able to return back to work using some facial protection and monitoring their temperature.\\xa0 But we’ll detail that for you.\\n\\nBut what we’re going to be doing, over the weeks ahead, is — while we focus every day at the point of the need — as the President said many times, our first mission is to save lives.\\xa0 And that means to slow the spread, bend the curve, to continue to engage the American people, which they are admirably doing, to continue to put all the social distancing into practice.\\n\\nBut there is a dual track that the President has already initiated.\\xa0 Some of the best minds here at the White House are beginning to think about what recommendations will look like that we give to businesses, that we give to states.\\xa0 But it’ll all — I promise you — be informed on putting the health and wellbeing of the American people first.\\n\\nDr. Birx.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Either for Dr. Birx or for Dr. Fauci.\\xa0 Do either of you want to take that or —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Secondly, as a lot of parents are sitting home with their kids, and they’ve been at home with their kids for weeks now, and they’re wondering — maybe resigned to the fact that maybe their kids aren’t going back to school this year, but are looking ahead — what do you think summer camp holds?\\xa0 And what do you think the start of next school year holds, if you could look down the line?\\xa0 Do you think those start on time?\\xa0 Do you think school next year starts on time?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Can I say a word on behalf of teachers, since I’m married to one?\\xa0 My wife was all day yesterday at the elementary school she teaches at, loading up about 500 bins of art supplies for kids.\\xa0 And she’s just one of millions of teachers across this country who find themselves having to distance-teach kids.\\xa0 And I’m proud of Karen, but, related to that, I’m proud of every teacher in this country.\\n\\nThe Secretary of Education was here not long ago, talking about our efforts to expand distance-learning resources even in K-12.\\xa0 To all of the teachers who are out there, we just want to say: Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you for what you’re doing for continuing learning, even in this challenging time.\\n\\nAnd to all of the kids, just because you’re home doesn’t mean you don’t have to do your schoolwork.\\xa0 Keep it up and —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 For either of you, do you anticipate children being back in class — in classes in August?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 What I will tell you is I’ll yield to the health experts, but it’ll be part of what we’re looking at, in terms of guidance going forward, whether it — whether it be summer school, or whether it be returning to school next fall.\\n\\nBut the most important thing we can do is put this epidemic behind us as quickly as possible.\\n\\nDr. Fauci?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Well, my daughter is a schoolteacher, so she asked me the same — the same question.\\xa0 You know, it is unpredictable, but you can get a feel for — if we start talking about the things where the curve goes down, and we really have minimum — how we respond and what kind of a rebound we see or don’t see, I think, is going to have a lot of influence probably more immediately on things like summer camps than it does in the fall.\\n\\nI fully expect — though I’m humble enough to know that I can’t accurately predict — that by the time we get to the fall, that we will have this under control enough that it certainly will not be the way it is now, where people are shutting schools.\\n\\nMy optimistic side tells me that we’ll be able to renew, to a certain extent.\\xa0 But it’s going to be different, remember now, because this is not going to disappear.\\xa0 So we’re going to have to have in place the capability of doing the things that we talk about all the time on this stage: to identify, to isolate, to contact trace — number one.\\n\\nNumber two, by that time, we’ll have a better feel with the antibody test, about what the actual penetrance of this infection was in society.\\xa0 How many people have actually been infected?\\xa0 Who is protected?\\xa0 If you have antibody, it’s very likely that you’re protected.\\xa0 Who’s vulnerable?\\xa0 Do you treat vulnerables different than you treat the people who are protected?\\xa0 All of these things are going to go into the decision of just how much back to the original way we’d like it to be in fall.\\n\\nThe bottom line is: No absolute prediction, but I think we’re going to be in good shape.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Fauci — can I ask one for Dr. Fauci or Dr. Birx?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, of course.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can you talk about your concerns about deaths being misreported by coronavirus because of either testing or standards for how they’re characterized?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So, I think, in this country, we’ve taken a very liberal approach to mortality, and I think the reporting here has been pretty straightforward over the last five to six weeks.\\xa0 Prior to that, when there wasn’t testing in January and February, that’s a very different situation and unknown.\\n\\nThere are other countries that if you had a pre-existing condition and let’s say the virus caused you to go to the ICU and then have a heart or kidney problem — some countries are recording that as a heart issue or a kidney issue and not a COVID-19 death.\\n\\nRight now, we’re still recording it, and we’ll — I mean, the great thing about having forms that come in and a form that has the ability to mark it as COVID-19 infection — the intent is, right now, that those — if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that as a COVID-19 death.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you — can you be sure — I mean, you hear from coroners that that’s not necessarily the case.\\xa0 Are you sure?\\xa0 How can you be confident about that?\\xa0 And is there any concern that it skews the data that you’re trying to collect, in terms of projections and things like that?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Well, I think that would apply more to rural areas that may not have the same level of testing.\\xa0 But I — I am pretty confident in New York City —\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 — and in New Jersey and places that have these large outbreaks and COVID-only hospitals, I can tell you they are testing.\\xa0 New York and New Jersey together have — by proportion, are testing extraordinary well — as Washington State and Louisiana.\\xa0 So, I don’t see that there’s been a barrier in testing to diagnosis.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 I — I think there’s so much focus now on coronavirus that — particularly if you take New York, which we all know is — is having a disproportionately higher proportion of the burden of the entire country is right now in New York.\\n\\nNo, I can’t imagine if someone comes in with coronavirus, goes to an ICU, and they have an underlying heart condition and they die — they’re going to say, “Cause of death: heart attack.”\\xa0 I — I cannot see that — that happening.\\xa0 So I don’t think it’s going to be a problem.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 How about one more?\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A question for Dr. Fauci on the virus hitting black communities the hardest.\\xa0 I mean, these numbers are staggering.\\xa0 Louisiana and other states are reporting 40 to 70 percent of deaths are African Americans.\\xa0 Do you expect that pattern to continue nationwide?\\xa0 Some states have not even reported their data yet.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 You know, I — I can’t be confident to — to predict patterns, but the underlying reason why that is happening doesn’t change from state to state.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you expect it to get worse?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 No, I expect that when African Americans get infected — given the disproportionate disparity of the underlying conditions that lead to complications like the ones I mentioned — I expect that we will still see the pattern that when you look at the proportion of people who get into serious trouble and die, again, it’s going to be disproportionate towards the African Americans.\\xa0 I do expect that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And is the federal government now leading the charge in collecting this information from the states?\\xa0 And when will it be made public?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 The answer is yes.\\xa0 It will be public as soon as you get enough data to be able to make a meaningful statement.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So can we expect this week or a couple of days?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The task force has assigned that to several members of the team.\\xa0 We’re assembling that data now.\\xa0 It’s a — it is a great concern for us.\\xa0 And, but it’s probably a good reminder that we have to be especially careful around people with serious underlying health conditions.\\n\\nAs we’ve said at many times from this podium over many weeks, that the risk of serious illness from the coronavirus remains low for the average American.\\xa0 But for anyone from any community that has a serious underlying health condition, particularly senior citizens with serious underlying health conditions, the risk of tragedy is very real.\\xa0 And so, we’re going to be very diligent about studying this and providing information and guidance in accordance with our best scientists.\\n\\nBut I do want to say to each and every American, the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America — about wash your hands; if you’re — if you’re sick, stay home; if you can work from home, if you’re not in critical infrastructure like our incredible healthcare workers or are all those heroic people working to keep food on the shelves at our grocery stores and keep medicine at the pharmacies, we — we ask you to — we ask you to work from home, if you can.\\xa0 Avoid unnecessary travel.\\xa0 Avoid gatherings of more than 10 people.\\xa0 Use a drive-through at a restaurant; don’t go in the restaurant.\\xa0 Not just to protect your health, but to protect those of every community of every background in this country who may have underlying conditions that make them susceptible to tragic outcomes.\\n\\nThat’s how we can all do our part to slow the spread and to protect our most vulnerable.\\xa0 And the American people are doing it.\\xa0 And as we continue to do that, we will hasten the day that we put the coronavirus in the past and we reopen America and put America back to work.\\n\\nThank you all.\\xa0 We’ll see you tomorrow.\\n\\nEND\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 7:27 P.M.

       "  'text': 'James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\\n\\nApril 6, 2020\\n5:41 P.M. EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 This week, America continues our aggressive effort to defeat the virus as we enter a crucial and difficult phase of the battle.\\n\\nWe continue to send our prayers to the people of New York and New Jersey, and to our whole country.\\xa0 But right now, New York and New Jersey are very hot zones, and we’re with them.\\xa0 We’re with everybody.\\xa0 Your struggle is our struggle, and we will beat this virus.\\xa0 We will beat it together.\\n\\nI also want to send best wishes to a very good friend of mine and a friend to our nation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\\xa0 We’re very saddened to hear that he was taken into intensive care this afternoon, a little while ago, and Americans are all praying for his recovery.\\xa0 He’s been a really good friend.\\xa0 He’s been really something very special.\\xa0 Strong.\\xa0 Resolute.\\xa0 Doesn’t quit.\\xa0 Doesn’t give up.\\n\\nWe have made tremendous progress on therapeutics.\\xa0 I had a fantastic call today, which I’ll be talking about a little bit later.\\xa0 And I’ve asked two of the leading companies — these are brilliant companies.\\xa0 Ebola, AIDS, others.\\xa0 They’ve come with the solutions and just have done incredible jobs.\\xa0 And I’ve asked them to contact London immediately.\\xa0 They have offices in London.\\xa0 They’re major companies.\\xa0 But more than major, more than size, they’re genius.\\n\\nAnd I had a talk with four of them today.\\xa0 And they speak a language that most people don’t even understand, but I understand something: that they’ve really advanced therapeutics and therapeutically, and they have arrived in London already.\\xa0 Their London office has whatever they need, and we’ll see if we can be of help.\\n\\nWe’ve contacted all of Boris’s doctors, and we’ll see what is going to take place.\\xa0 But they are ready to go.\\xa0 But when you get brought into intensive care, that gets very, very serious with this particular disease.\\n\\nSo, the two companies are there.\\xa0 And with what they are talking about — and it’s rather complex and has had really incredible results — we’re working with the FDA and everybody else, but we are working with London, with respect to Boris Johnson.\\n\\nAcross the country, we’re attacking the enemy on all fronts, including medical, scientific, social, logistical, and economic.\\xa0 We’re pressing into action the full power of American government and American enterprise.\\xa0 And our military has been incredible.\\xa0 We’ve just sent 3,000 public health personnel.\\xa0 They’re now deployed in the New York area, and they’ll be over at the Javits Center, over at the great ship.\\n\\nAnd as you probably have heard — and I was informed that Governor Cuomo has already told you and announced — he called me up a little while ago, and he asked whether or not it would be possible to use the ship, with respect to fighting the virus.\\xa0 And we hadn’t had that in mind at all, but we’re going to let him do it, and we’re also going to let New Jersey.\\xa0 Governor Murphy — we spoke with him a little while ago, and New Jersey is going to use it also because New Jersey is a hot — a hotspot.\\n\\nSo Governor Murphy and Governor Cuomo are going to be using the ship for New York, New Jersey.\\xa0 And it’s a big ship, and it’s now COVID; it’s set for COVID.\\xa0 And we are going to — hopefully that will be very helpful to both states.\\xa0 The Javits Center, which is 2,900 beds, just built by our military, also is going to be manned now by the military.\\xa0 And they should be in place tomorrow, and they’ll start sending quite a few people over to the Javits Center.\\xa0 It’s convenient.\\xa0 It’s right in the middle of everything.\\xa0 So that’ll be something great.\\n\\nAnd we appreciated Governor Cuomo’s nice — really nice statements and, likewise, Governor Murphy.\\xa0 We have worked very well with both of them and with, frankly, all of the governors.\\xa0 Vice President Pence had a call this morning with them that lasted for close to two hours.\\xa0 And I understand there wasn’t a negative person on the call.\\xa0 Fifty governors — or just about fifty governors — I think they were all on, from what I understood.\\xa0 And they were very positive about everything their federal government has been doing for them.\\xa0 And you’ll hear what that is, and it’s — it’s rather amazing, actually.\\n\\nNationwide, the Army Corps of Engineers is building 22 field hospitals — these are big hospitals — and alternate care sites in 18 states.\\xa0 So you have a combination of 22 field hospitals.\\xa0 In addition to that, we’re building alternate care sites, which is a little bit of a smaller version of the hospital.\\xa0 And we have a lot of them, and they’re going up in 18 different states.\\n\\nIn total, we have deployed 8,450 hospital beds from federal stockpiles.\\xa0 And, you know, if you think, this is done over a period of — really, a period of weeks.\\xa0 It’s incredible, actually.\\xa0 More than 8,000 ventilators have been sent from the National Stockpile to our cities and states, backed by the Defense Production Act, which we’ve used very strongly, very powerfully.\\xa0 So powerfully that we don’t have to use it too much, frankly.\\xa0 And it’s nice when you don’t have to.\\xa0 We’re getting more than we ever bargained for.\\n\\nAmerican industry is stepping up.\\xa0 Manufacturers are really going to town.\\xa0 And we have thousands of ventilators being built as we speak, and we have hundreds that are being sent to different locations, and we’re ready to roll with almost 10,000 that we have in the federal stockpile.\\n\\nWhen I say “ready to roll,” too, I mean exactly what that states: We are — wherever that monster goes, we’re able to move with it.\\xa0 Great flexibility.\\xa0 We have tremendous flexibility.\\xa0 And we have people waiting, and they’re ready, willing, and able, but waiting to bring them wherever it may be, if they need it.\\xa0 If they need it.\\xa0 It’s possible that they won’t be needed, that we’re fully stocked, because numbers are coming in where, because of what the American people are doing, we’re having fewer hospital visits.\\xa0 I think that could be the case in New York.\\xa0 It could be the case in a few other states.\\xa0 And fewer beds, fewer hospital visits mean fewer ventilators.\\xa0 So we’ll see whether or not our original projections were right.\\n\\nBut anyway, I had a very good talk with both governors, and I think they’re very happy — extremely happy about the — what we’re doing for them, and especially going all COVID.\\xa0 So that’ll take place almost immediately.\\n\\nFEMA and HHS have directly distributed 11.7 million N95 respirators.\\xa0 Think of that.\\xa0 Get the number.\\xa0 11.7 million N95 respirators.\\xa0 11.7 million.\\xa0 26.5 million surgical masks, 5.3 million face shields, 4.4 million surgical gowns, and 22.6 million gloves.\\xa0 22.6 million gloves.\\n\\nWe have also arranged for vast quantities of additional materials to be allocated through donations and existing supply chains.\\xa0 We’ve also given tremendous medical material and supplies throughout the 50 states and territories.\\n\\nAnd through Project Airbridge, we have succeeded in bringing planeloads of vital supplies into the United States from overseas.\\xa0 We had an additional three.\\xa0 These are massive planes, by the way.\\xa0 The big planes — they’re very big, very powerful, and they’re loaded to the gills with supplies.\\xa0 And rather than bringing them into our stockpile, as we’ve discussed, we bring them to all the different locations where they’re needed so we can save a big step and a timely step.\\n\\nBecause of my actions, under the DPA, I can also announce today that we have reached an agreement — a very amicable agreement — with 3M for the delivery of an additional 55.5 million high-quality facemask — facemasks each month.\\xa0 So that we’re going to be getting, over the next couple of months, 166.5 million masks for our frontline healthcare workers.\\n\\nSo the 3M saga ends very happily.\\xa0 We’re very proud to be dealing now with 3M and its CEO, Mike Roman.\\xa0 I just spoke with him and I thanked him for getting it done.\\xa0 And Mike was very happy to get it done.\\xa0 It’s a great company.\\xa0 So we’re getting 166.5 million masks, and mostly that’s going to be for our frontline healthcare workers.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 That’s 3M.\\xa0 Thank you, 3M.\\n\\nI also want to thank Apple, one of the many great American companies that’s taken into — that’s really leapt into action.\\xa0 Today, Apple announced that it is now producing plastic face shields for healthcare workers at the rate of 1 million per week.\\xa0 One million.\\xa0 And these are the shields that you see on television quite a bit.\\xa0 And they’re at the highest level of quality and safety.\\n\\nWe’re grateful, as well, to Salesforce, which has donated 48 million pieces of personal protective equipment, including masks, gowns, suits, and face shields.\\xa0 So thank you very much to Salesforce.\\n\\nI urge all of our nation’s governors to ensure that the massive deliveries that we’ve made to your states over the past few weeks are distributed as quickly as possible.\\n\\nSo again, we’re working very well with the governors.\\xa0 Now, they may see you and say, “Oh, we’re not happy.”\\xa0 But they’re very happy on the phone.\\xa0 And Mike Pence is a straight shooter, and he had a great phone conversation to them, with all of the governors.\\xa0 Teleconference.\\xa0 And they’re very happy, every one of them.\\n\\nWere there any negatives?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 See?\\xa0 I told you.\\xa0 Mike is the greatest.\\xa0 Mike — and you have done a great job, Mike, and I appreciate it.\\xa0 The whole country appreciates it.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nAnthony appreciates it, right?\\xa0 Aren’t you — see?\\xa0 Everybody appreciates Mike.\\xa0 A special man.\\n\\nSo a lot of the things that we’ve done, again, are going directly to the states.\\xa0 The states seem to be very happy.\\xa0 If they’re not, they can call me directly, they can call Mike directly, and we’ll make them happy.\\xa0 But tremendous progress has been made in a very short period.\\n\\nAnd I think, very importantly, the progress has been made before the surge comes, because the next week, week and a half, is going to be a big surge, the professionals tell us.\\xa0 And I think we’re in good shape for it, Anthony.\\xa0 So it’s good timing.\\xa0 Really good timing.\\xa0 We can have the stuff there.\\xa0 It’s already there, for the most part, but we’re bringing a lot of different resources to the various locations, especially where the surge is looking like it’s going to take place.\\n\\nResources from the National Stockpile need to reach our warriors.\\xa0 And they are warriors.\\xa0 I tell it all the time.\\xa0 I saw it again this morning, these young, in many cases — in many cases, older — but they’re walking into the hospital, and they’re putting on — I mean, as that door is opened, they’re going into this place, and, you know, it’s not exactly too safe.\\xa0 And they’re going in there and they’re putting the outfits on and they’re putting their masks on, and they’re — it’s incredible.\\xa0 It’s no — it’s truly — it’s like no different than you watch the war movies or you watch the old clips of war, running up hills.\\xa0 It’s — to me, it’s the same thing.\\n\\nMen and women, young and old, but a lot of young people, just going in there.\\xa0 They’re not thinking about, “Oh, gee, this is dangerous.”\\xa0 They’re not saying, “Oh, I don’t want to go in.”\\xa0 They’re — they’re warriors.\\xa0 They’re running through those doors.\\xa0 It’s the most incredible thing.\\xa0 It’s a beautiful — it’s an incredible, beautiful thing.\\n\\nResources from the National Stockpile need to reach these warriors in the hospitals immediately, and we’re making sure they do.\\xa0 And again, the states have that responsibility, but we’re working with the states and we’re getting the states a lot of things that they can distribute.\\xa0 Or when they tell us, we bring it directly to the hospital from the federal stockpile, or from the planes that land without even going to the stockpile.\\n\\nIf any state is having difficulty distributing supplies, we urge you to use the National Guard to assist in the delivery.\\xa0 And I have to say, you have done a fantastic job.\\n\\nDeborah, you know that you’ve done great.\\xa0 Tony, you know that you’ve done great.\\n\\nBut what a job you’ve done.\\xa0 And I appreciate it.\\xa0 I really do.\\xa0 Your whole group has been incredible.\\xa0 That’s a lot of stars you have.\\xa0 I’ll tell you that.\\xa0 He’s supposed to do a great job when you have four stars, right?\\n\\nBut the military has been incredible, and I thank them for all of us.\\n\\nConversely, if a state believes that it has surplus equipment or supplies — very important, because we actually have gotten so much to some of the states that they’re able to now — they’ve done a fantastic job and they’ve kept — they’ve kept that line low.\\xa0 And we have some states that have surplus equipment and supplies, and they’re working with us to rapidly redeploy those supplies to areas of greatest need.\\xa0 We thought that might happen.\\xa0 If it worked out well, that’s what was going to happen, and it’s happening.\\n\\nAnd I want to thank Governor Gavin Newsom, who’s doing a tremendous job, who’s announced California will send 500 ventilators to be distributed to other locations.\\xa0 I think some are going to Arizona.\\xa0 Some are going to Washington, D.C.\\xa0 We think they’re going to Delaware.\\xa0 We’re working it out.\\xa0 But 500 excess ventilators from the State of California.\\xa0 And we’re going to get them taken care of wherever they have to go.\\xa0 Those decisions are being made right now.\\n\\nThe members of the White House Task Force and I are in close touch with mayors and governors and hospital administrators across our country.\\xa0 And we’re told that the present time — at the present time, most of the critical needs are — are being more than met.\\xa0 States have to continue sharing detailed information in the amount and utilization rates of medical supplies so we know what to resupply them.\\xa0 Or they can get it directly; that includes ventilators.\\xa0 They can get it directly.\\xa0 Ideally, if they can get it directly, but if they can’t, if they’re unable to do it, we have tremendous amounts of supplies.\\xa0 And we’re building it up very fast too.\\xa0 And this is before the big surge.\\n\\nThis information is fundamental to our ability to deliver the material when — when and where it’s most needed.\\n\\nNow, Mike, in his conversation today, I think got some information as to a couple of locations where we’re going to be delivering large numbers of ventilators and large numbers of medical supplies.\\xa0 And we’ll take care of that.\\n\\nBut some of the states are very happy.\\xa0 Even Governor Pritzker, from Illinois, is happy.\\xa0 Of course, he may not be happy when he talks to the press, but he’s happy.\\xa0 He’s a very happy man.\\n\\nWe’re increasingly hopeful that the aggressive mitigation strategy we put into place will ultimately allow our hospital system to successfully manage the major influx of cases that — that we have right now.\\xa0 Again, I say that we’re finding, because of the incredible job done by the American people in conjunction with everybody — governors, the military, federal government, state government, local government — had a lot of conversations with New York City and Mayor de Blasio.\\xa0 I’ve gotten to know him.\\xa0 I didn’t know him.\\xa0 Gotten to know him.\\xa0 And a lot of people are working hard.\\xa0 Everybody is working hard.\\xa0 A lot of people are doing a great job — I’ll tell you that.\\xa0 A lot of people are doing a great job.\\n\\nBut the goals that all Americans have been sacrificing to achieve these last few weeks are things that a lot of people thought were not possible to achieve.\\xa0 And I think we’ve more than achieved, but we have to go through.\\n\\nAgain, we’re going to have a rough week.\\xa0 We’re going to have maybe a rough a little more than a week.\\xa0 And — but there’s tremendous light at the end of that tunnel.\\xa0 I said it last time.\\xa0 I said it last night: There’s tremendous light at the end of the tunnel.\\xa0 There’s so many things happening with therapeutics, with vaccines, with things that we really want.\\n\\nDeborah, Tony, they’re all working so hard on this.\\xa0 But those therapeutics — I mean, look, the vaccines are going to be always a little bit later because of that testing period, but the therapeutics — getting the kind of things that I heard about today, talking to these brilliant companies and brilliant people on the phone was fantastic.\\xa0 It was such an incredible conversation.\\n\\nAnd I also spoke, just a few minutes ago, with Vice President — former Vice President Biden, who called.\\xa0 And we had a really wonderful, warm conversation.\\xa0 It was a very nice conversation.\\xa0 We talked about pretty much this.\\xa0 This is what we talked about.\\xa0 This is what everyone is talking about.\\xa0 This is what they want to talk about.\\xa0 And he gave me his point of view, and I fully understood that.\\xa0 And we just had a very friendly conversation.\\xa0 It lasted probably 15 minutes, and it was really good.\\xa0 It was really good.\\xa0 Really nice.\\xa0 I think it was very much so.\\xa0 I appreciate his calling.\\n\\nAs we continue our efforts to develop treatments and cures, this afternoon I spoke with leaders of the American pharmaceutical companies.\\xa0 And just to give you their names: Amgen, Genentech, Gilead, Regeneron.\\xa0 These are four the greatest in the world for doing exactly what they’re doing.\\n\\nAnd currently, 10 different therapeutic agents are in active trials and some are looking incredibly successful, but we have to go through a process.\\xa0 And it’s going to be a fairly quick process, I will tell you, based on what the FDA told me.\\xa0 And another 15 are in plans for clinical trials.\\xa0 So they’re advancing rapidly.\\n\\nAnd today, a second company announced that the FDA has authorized its vaccine candidate to begin clinical trials.\\xa0 So you have — Johnson & Johnson is already there.\\xa0 I believe they’re the one that’s first.\\xa0 And now we have a second company that just — just announced.\\xa0 And we were just — it was just approved.\\xa0 So we have two companies at that level for the vaccine itself.\\n\\nWe’ve now performed 100 — well, if you think of this: 1.79 million tests.\\xa0 That’s 1,790,000 tests nationwide.\\xa0 And I think we’re going to put up a screen here someplace.\\xa0 Good.\\xa0 They’re on cue.\\xa0 They’re just on cue.\\xa0 And here it is.\\xa0 This is the process starting on 5 March and ending right there.\\xa0 Right about now.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 That’s about it.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 Yesterday.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So — and it’s going up at a rapid rate.\\xa0 Nobody has done more testing.\\n\\nAnd one of the reasons why they say — and I think I can say this, Deborah, very strongly — but one of the reasons that we have more cases is we’ve done more testing.\\xa0 If I went to some of these countries that have, in my opinion, far more people than we do, that had the problem, and if we did the kind of testing proportionately that we’re doing, they’d have many more cases than us.\\xa0 But we have more cases because we do much more testing.\\n\\nSo when you do the testing, you have cases.\\xa0 Otherwise, you wouldn’t know about the cases.\\xa0 People sit home; you don’t know about it.\\n\\nBut we have now done 1,790,000 tests nationwide.\\xa0 That’s more than any other country in the world, hence we have more cases.\\xa0 And that number is growing by nearly 125,000 people per day.\\xa0 Think of that one.\\xa0 So it’s growing by 125,000 people per day.\\n\\nI told you about South Korea.\\xa0 This is a, you know, vastly faster — and we also have, they say, the most accurate of tests.\\n\\nCVS is launching — and they’ve been great — two new drive-through testing sites in Atlanta, Georgia, and Providence, Rhode Island.\\xa0 And each location will be able to test up to 1,000 patients per day using the ultra-fast five-minute test developed by Abbott Labs.\\xa0 Now they’re down to five minutes.\\xa0 They call it the “ultra-fast” and it’s very accurate.\\xa0 Abbott Labs, I want to thank them.\\xa0 They’ve been fantastic.\\n\\nWe’re also speeding urgent economic relief to the American worker and families and the employers.\\xa0 As of today, tens of thousands of small businesses have applied for more than $40 billion in relief under the Paycheck Protection Program.\\xa0 You’ve all been reading about it.\\xa0 And it’s really — I mean, it’s only been going for a couple of days.\\xa0 It’s really been performing well.\\xa0 A couple of little glitches — minor glitches that have already been taken care of, what they say.\\n\\nThese funds will result in nearly 2 million jobs being preserved.\\xa0 So we’re taking care of our workers — small businesses and our workers.\\n\\nNearly 3,000 lenders have already made loans under the program, and we’re signing up additional lenders very quickly — rapidly.\\n\\nCommunity banks have been very responsive, and larger banks are also stepping up.\\xa0 If this — if we run out of funds — by the way, we’re already preparing because it’s going so fast for the small businesses and their employees — we’ll ask Congress to refill it immediately.\\xa0 But the banks have been great.\\xa0 The big banks — the Bank of America was right up there at the beginning.\\xa0 JPMorgan Chase was — has been great.\\xa0 After the first day, they really — they really came through, and a lot of the big banks.\\xa0 But the community banks have been fantastic.\\n\\nAs we announced last week, we are providing $100 billion in direct support for our hospitals.\\xa0 And the first tranche, $30 billion, will be distributed this week.\\n\\nSo I want to — I want to say one other thing.\\xa0 Our farmers — we love our farmers — and, as you know, as of April 1st, the China trade deal — 250-billion-dollar — they purchased $250 billion from us, if not more.\\xa0 And of that, approximately $50 billion is expected to be with our farmers.\\n\\nSo it kicked in as of April 1st, and we’ll see how it goes.\\xa0 It seems like they’re buying.\\xa0 So we’ll let you know how that’s going.\\xa0 But they’re buying anywhere from $40- to $50 billion worth of our agricultural product.\\xa0 That should have a huge impact on our farmers — a tremendous impact on our farmers.\\xa0 But we’re watching it very closely.\\n\\nTo fight the medical war, we’ve mobilized the unbeatable — and it just — it is unbeatable — strength of American determination, ingenuity, and compassion.\\xa0 I got to see that when I spoke to the great science — because I call them “science companies” more than drug companies.\\xa0 They’re scientists.\\n\\nWe’ve seen businesses, charities, and private citizens making generous donations.\\xa0 So many people are making donations.\\xa0 We’ve seen states and cities supporting and helping each other and caring for our citizens.\\xa0 And we’ve seen Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs uniting together to answer the challenge and rise to the moment.\\xa0 And that’s what they’re doing.\\n\\nAbove all, we have been awe-inspired by the exceptional courage of the doctors, nurses, EMTs, and healthcare workers who are the soldiers of this war.\\xa0 No words can ever express the complete measure of our gratitude for these intrepid heroes.\\n\\nOne Cleveland patient credited his medical team for not only saving his life through their skill, but forever changing his life through their example of selfless devotion.\\xa0 Couldn’t believe it — so generous he was with his statements.\\xa0 And he talked about their bravery in an area that was in such trouble — an area of that hospital where people were dying.\\xa0 And he talked about their bravery.\\n\\nAnother survivor in Houston said simply, “I will consider them my angels forever.”\\xa0 “I will consider them” — think of that — “my angels forever.”\\n\\nAs our nation endures the depths of loss and grief, we are also witness to the summit of American virtue, character, and courage.\\xa0 With the love and dedication of every American patriot, we will win this battle, we will defeat this enemy, and we will rise from this present crisis with new strength, unity, and resolve.\\xa0 And that’s what’s happening.\\n\\nTremendous stories are coming out of this horrible moment. A very dark moment for the world.\\xa0 One hundred and eighty two.\\xa0 I was saying 151 for a while, and then it got up to 160.\\xa0 And it’s 182, as I announced yesterday.\\xa0 A hundred and eighty-two countries are being attacked by this virus.\\n\\nSo I just want to thank everybody, and I want to thank the American citizens for doing a great job.\\xa0 Stay inside.\\xa0 And let’s win this, and let’s get our country open as soon as we can.\\xa0 I think it’s going to be sooner than people think.\\xa0 Things are going really well.\\xa0 Again, light at the end of the tunnel.\\n\\nAnd with that, I’ll take a few questions.\\xa0 And then Mike is going to take over and talk with the Admiral and with the professionals.\\xa0 And we appreciate you being here.\\n\\nYes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you mentioned that you were asking U.S. drug companies to provide treatment to the British Prime Minister.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What sort of treatment is that?\\xa0 Is that something that’s available to the American public?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it’s a very — yeah, it’s a very complex treatment of things that they’ve just recently developed and that they have a lot of experience with, having to do with something else, but recent for this.\\xa0 And they’ll be — they’ve already concurred.\\xa0 They’ve already had meetings with the doctors.\\xa0 And we’ll see whether or not they want to go that route.\\n\\nBut when you’re in intensive care, it’s a big deal.\\xa0 So they’re there and they’re ready.\\xa0 I think we have — we have three of them.\\xa0 We have — I spoke with four.\\xa0 You know who the four would be.\\xa0 And you know the people within those — you probably — you’d know the companies if I told you the companies.\\xa0 But the people are the greatest — the greatest in the world.\\n\\nSo they’re at the hospital, and we’ll see.\\xa0 And they have — they have everything with them, should it be needed.\\xa0 Hopefully — hopefully it won’t have to be needed, but should it be needed.\\n\\nI just — I’ve found him — I’ve found Boris to be a fantastic person.\\xa0 Just, like, a fantastic warm, strong, smart guy.\\xa0 He loves his country.\\xa0 You see that.\\xa0 I mean, he fought like — like hell for his country.\\xa0 And intensive care is big stuff.\\xa0 Really big stuff.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yesterday, you were asked about this as well, but now that he has been moved to intensive care, does that give you and the Vice President any pause or additional concerns, steps that you’re taking to preserve the continuity of government here?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I don’t think so.\\xa0 Mike had his test a couple of days ago.\\xa0 I had my test a couple of days ago.\\xa0 So — and we’re here, and here you are.\\xa0 So, no, I don’t think so.\\xa0 But I think we’ll probably — just because of questions like that, I think we’ll probably have maybe quite a few tests.\\xa0 It’s not the worst idea.\\n\\nYou know, the system of testing now is so quick and so easy.\\xa0 So, I could see —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I was tested again today.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And you were tested again today?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You sure you’re okay?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m okay.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good.\\xa0 Then I’m staying here.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Despite the nearly 1.8 million tests that you say the United States has done, the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services released a report today — a survey — of more than 300 hospitals across the country.\\xa0 And the number one complaint from those hospitals were severe shortages of testing supplies and a really long wait time.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it’s just wrong.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I mean, a week or longer.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s just wrong.\\xa0 Did I hear the word “inspector general”?\\xa0 Really?\\xa0 It’s wrong.\\xa0 And they’ll talk to you about it.\\xa0 It’s wrong.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But this is your own government.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Uh, it’s — well, where did he come from — the inspector general?\\xa0 What’s his name?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It came from the inspector general report —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, what’s his name?\\xa0 What’s his name?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I don’t know his name off of the top of my head.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, find me his name.\\xa0 Let me know.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 If you find me his name, I’d appreciate it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But, sir, these are hospitals that do not —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 All I can tell you is this: We put up on the board —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, these are hospitals —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You’re going to ask — you’re going to ask the Admiral.\\xa0 But we are doing —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, these are hospitals who say that they’re waiting a week or longer to get their test —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Fine.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — results.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Then speak to the Admiral.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Why is it still taking so long?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But we’ve done more testing and had more results than any country, anywhere in the world.\\xa0 They’re doing an incredible job.\\xa0 Now they’re all calling us.\\xa0 They want our testing.\\xa0 “What are we doing?”\\xa0 “How do you do the five-minute test?”\\xa0 “How do you do the 15-minute test?”\\n\\nSo, give me the name of the inspector general.\\xa0 Could politics be entered into that?\\n\\nGo ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This is our —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 Are you worried about retaliation to your decision to ban export of medical goods, like Indian Prime Minister Modi’s decision to not export hydroxychloroquine to the United States and other countries?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t like that decision, if that’s — I don’t — I didn’t hear that that was his decision.\\xa0 I know that he stopped it for other countries.\\xa0 I spoke to him yesterday.\\xa0 We had a very good talk.\\xa0 And we’ll see whether or not that is.\\xa0 I would be surprised if he would, you know, because India does very well with the United States.\\xa0 For many years, they’ve been taking advantage of the United States on trade.\\xa0 So I would be surprised if that were his decision.\\xa0 He’d have to tell me that.\\n\\nI spoke to him Sunday morning.\\xa0 I called him.\\xa0 And I said, “We’d appreciate your allowing our supply to come out.”\\xa0 If he doesn’t allow it to come out, that would be okay, but, of course, there may be retaliation.\\xa0 Why wouldn’t there be?\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 The Paycheck Protection Program has gotten off to a confusing start for small businesses because —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t think so.\\xa0 I think it’s done very well.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, Wells Fargo has stopped taking applications. Bank of America initially prior- —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Not anymore, they haven’t.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — prioritized taking applications from clients that were already borrowers.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Bank of America has been the leader, taking tremendous numbers of applications, and, of course, there may have been — they wanted to have a slightly different application, they wanted to have a little different information.\\xa0 But Bank of America has been a leader.\\xa0 They had number one in terms of applications.\\n\\nI wish you’d ask the question differently.\\xa0 Why don’t you say, “It’s gotten off to a tremendous start, but there are some little glitches” — which, by the way, have been worked out?\\xa0 It would be so much nicer if you’d do that.\\xa0 But you’re just incapable of asking a question in a positive way.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, what oversight measures is the federal government putting in place to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s already done.\\xa0 It’s already done.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — ensure that there is fairness?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s taken the measures.\\xa0 It’s taken the measures.\\xa0 And we may even do a different system.\\xa0 Not with this.\\xa0 We’re going to have to probably add more money to this, to save — and to keep our small businesses going and to keep the employees of those small businesses working.\\n\\nBut it’s such a positive event and you ask it in such a negative way.\\xa0 It’s just — I wish — I wish we had a fair media in this country, and we really don’t.\\n\\nSpeaking of unfair, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, the Acting Secretary of the Navy told the crew of the USS Roosevelt that Captain Crozier was either, quote, “too naive or too stupid” to be in command.\\xa0 Is it appropriate for the Chief Officer of the Navy to be speaking this way about this captain?\\xa0 Is this the right way to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I haven’t heard it exactly.\\xa0 I haven’t heard.\\xa0 I heard they had a statement that was made.\\xa0 If that were the statement — it’s a strong statement.\\n\\nLook, the letters shouldn’t have been sent, and certainly they shouldn’t have been leaked.\\xa0 This is a military operation.\\n\\nI must tell you, I’ve heard very good things about the gentleman — both gentlemen, by the way — I will say this.\\xa0 But about both gentlemen.\\xa0 And I may look into it only from the standpoint that something should be resolved, because I’m hearing good things about both people.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What might you look into, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I may just get involved, if it’s okay with you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible), you mean?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, because, you know what?\\xa0 You have two good people and they’re arguing.\\xa0 And I’m good, believe it or not, at settling arguments.\\xa0 I’m good at settling these arguments.\\xa0 So I may look into it in great detail — in detail. And I’ll be able to figure it out very fast.\\n\\nBut that was a statement — and it’s a rough statement.\\xa0 But look —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Might you reinstate him if you decide it was —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Look — look, letters should not have been sent to many people, unclassified. \\xa0That was a mistake.\\xa0 It’s a mistake that shouldn’t have been made, because it’s unfair to the families of the people on the ship because they get nervous.\\xa0 And it shows weakness.\\xa0 And there’s nothing weak about us now.\\xa0 Not anymore.\\xa0 We have the strongest military we’ve ever had.\\xa0 And we’re not going to be showing weakness to anybody because we have — that ship is incredible — nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.\\xa0 And we don’t want to be doing — writing letters.\\xa0 We don’t want to have letter-writing campaigns where the fake news finds a letter or gets a leak.\\xa0 We don’t want that.\\n\\nSo, the letter —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Would you consider reinstating him —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Excuse me.\\xa0 So the letter shouldn’t have been sent.\\xa0 With all of that said, his career prior to that was very good.\\xa0 So I’m going to get involved and see exactly what’s going on there.\\xa0 Because I don’t want to destroy somebody for having a bad day.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 Does that make sense?\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, Vice President Biden’s spokesperson said that he had made some suggestions to you about actions that you can be taking —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He did.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — to deal with the pandemic.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He did.\\xa0 We had a very good talk.\\xa0 We agreed that we weren’t going to talk about what we said, but we had a very, very good talk.\\xa0 It was a warm talk.\\xa0 I enjoyed it.\\xa0 I hope he enjoyed it, too.\\xa0 And it was short.\\xa0 It was 15 minutes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Did he have good suggestions?\\xa0 Anything that you’re going to do?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, he had suggestions.\\xa0 It doesn’t mean that I agree with those suggestions, but certainly he had suggestions.\\xa0 And I also told him some of the things we’re doing.\\xa0 But the conversation was a friendly — very friendly conversation.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thanks a lot, Mr. President.\\xa0 You’ve mentioned, other members of your task force have mentioned, over the course of the next two weeks it’s going to be a very difficult time for our country in terms of fatalities.\\xa0 And there —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It will be a difficult week and a half…\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 And there are a number of governors who are close allies of yours, Mr. President, who have refrained thus far to have these stay-at-home orders.\\xa0 And Dr. Fauci, who of course is on your task force, has said that —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 True.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — it would — the states that don’t have stay-at-home orders are putting themselves at risk and the country at risk.\\xa0 Do you agree with that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, if Dr. Fauci said that, I would be inclined to call them up.\\xa0 You know, we do have a constitutional problem in doing that.\\xa0 You understand that.\\xa0 I mean, there’s a double — there’s a double-edged sword.\\xa0 You understand.\\xa0 I can do it, but it is a constitutional — you can say federalist, you can say there’s lots of different reasons, where I would rather have the governors do it, make their own determination.\\n\\nThey’re smaller — and not in all cases but, sort of, they’re smaller cases.\\xa0 But I’m not sure 100 percent that Dr. Fauci said that, but you can ask him.\\n\\nTony, you want to say something?\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 So I had — I had good conversations with the governor of Nebraska and the governor of Iowa here.\\xa0 And it’s interesting that, functionally, even though they have not given a strict stay-at-home, what they are doing is really functionally equivalent to that.\\xa0 And we had a really good conversation with both of the governors.\\n\\nAnd — and I — you know, when I had mentioned that, I think there was a public response that they weren’t really doing anything at all.\\xa0 And they really are doing a very good job, both of them.\\xa0 Those are the only two that I spoke to, but — but it was a really good conversation.\\n\\nAnd I want to make sure people understand that just because they don’t have a very strict stay-at-home order, they have in place a lot of things that are totally compatible with what everyone else is doing.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If I can ask a question of Dr. Fauci before he —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 About getting back to normal: You said you wanted to get back to normal as soon as possible. \\xa0Will we truly get back to normal in this country before there’s an actual vaccine that’s available to everybody?\\xa0 And how do you — how do you start lifting the restrictions safely?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Well, Jon, if back to normal means acting like there never was a coronavirus problem, I don’t think that’s going to happen until we do have a situation where you can completely protect the population.\\xa0 But when we say “getting back to normal,” we mean something very different from what we’re going through right now, because right now we are in a very intense mitigation.\\n\\nWhen we get back to normal, we will go back gradually to the point where we can function as a society.\\xa0 But you’re absolutely right.\\xa0 I mean, if you want to get to pre-coronavirus, you know, that might not ever happen in the sense of the fact that the threat is there.\\xa0 But I believe, with the therapies that will be coming online, and with the fact that I feel confident that over a period of time we will get a good vaccine, that we will never have to get back to where we are right back now.\\n\\nSo if that means getting back to normal, then we’ll get back to normal.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think that with the therapies and I think that with the vaccines, which I have total confidence are coming — and I’m dealing with the companies.\\xa0 I’m talking to Johnson & Johnson, I’m talking to all of them.\\n\\nI think that when you add the tremendous stimulus that we’re giving — like, for instance, deductibility for restaurant expenses, for restaurants and entertainment; the money that we’re talking about for small businesses and employees to keep everybody working; and other things that we’re, frankly, working on right now, which are going to be great for our people — I think when you add that to it, I think we can get more than back to normal, from an economic standpoint.\\xa0 It would actually be better.\\xa0 But more than back to normal.\\n\\nBut I — I would agree that we’d love to see a vaccine, but immediately, we’d love to see a therapeutic.\\xa0 And I think we’re getting very close.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you think you’d be able to lift restrictions on April 30th right now — (inaudible)?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t want to comment on that, but I can tell you that we certainly want to try.\\xa0 We certainly want to see what — what’s going on.\\xa0 We’re doing very well.\\xa0 Look, if you look at those, you look at most places where that — you can call it the “bump.”\\xa0 You could call it the “hill”.\\xa0 You can call it the “mountain.”\\xa0 You can call it — whatever you want to do it.\\xa0 It’s very flat.\\xa0 You take a look.\\xa0 And that was done through mitigation.\\xa0 That was done through a lot of good work.\\n\\nAnd that far exceeded our expectations before.\\xa0 I mean, you — people can’t even believe how — how low some of those bumps are, some of those hills are.\\xa0 They’re very surprised.\\xa0 They have a couple of tough ones.\\xa0 New Jersey has been very tough and New York has been very tough.\\xa0 They’re crowded in.\\xa0 You know, it’s tight, it’s tougher.\\xa0 But far exceeding.\\xa0 California far exceeds; Washington State far exceeds.\\n\\nYou look at so many of these states, how well they’re doing.\\xa0 The eight states, by the way — and I haven’t spoken to the governors, but Tony is so right: They may not have it from the standpoint that they’re saying it, but those people are practicing it and they’re doing a fantastic job.\\xa0 Take a look at where they are, in terms of the levels.\\xa0 But take a look where they are.\\n\\nSo — but if I thought it was something that — and I’ve looked at them, and I’ve looked at them very carefully.\\xa0 I looked at them today, looked at them yesterday.\\xa0 From a constitutional standpoint, I’d love not to get involved with that.\\xa0 And not from a legal standpoint, just from a moral, constitutional standpoint.\\xa0 Because legally, I can, but morally, I — you know, I believe in our Constitution, much more so than most people.\\n\\nAnd I’d love to be able to let the governors do what they have to do.\\xa0 Those states are doing a fantastic job, all eight of them.\\xa0 They’re doing a fantastic job.\\xa0 So we’ll see what happens.\\n\\nAs for your question, you fully understand what I’m saying, so thank you.\\n\\nYes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Hi.\\xa0 I have two questions, if I may.\\xa0 One from somebody outside the room.\\xa0 But first, could I ask: Do you think Boris Johnson, when he talked about shaking hands with hospital patients, did he downplay the threat of this virus too much?\\xa0 And do you know exactly what his current condition is?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think Boris was looking at it differently.\\xa0 He was looking at it earlier.\\xa0 He was looking at it like “ride it out.”\\xa0 There were many people thinking about riding it out, meaning, you know, whatever it is, it is.\\n\\nBut then you see what starts to happen and the numbers become monumental, and they decide not to do that.\\xa0 We actually moved early.\\xa0 We moved early because of what we did with respect to the ban on China coming in and then Europe coming in.\\xa0 That was an early ban too.\\xa0 And then UK.\\n\\nSo, no, he — he waited a little while, and he — he felt that, but he got — you know, he made a decision very quickly thereafter to do what they did.\\xa0 And they they — they’ve gone to a very strict lockdown.\\xa0 But they’re suffering greatly as a nation right now.\\xa0 They’re going through a lot.\\xa0 You know, they’re — they’re a nation that’s having a difficult time.\\n\\nBut I’ve gotten to know him.\\xa0 He’s just such an incredible guy.\\xa0 It was just so shocking to see that because you know what that means.\\xa0 Intensive care is a big deal with regard to what we’re talking about.\\xa0 That’s a very big deal, a very scary deal.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just, somebody who can’t be in the room because of social distancing has asked me to ask a question.\\xa0 It’s Thomas Howell of the Washington Times:\\xa0How many health workers in the U.S. have become infected with COVID-19?\\xa0 And if the answer is not known, will the CDC be publishing that data?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I could get you that information.\\xa0 I think they’d — I think they’d probably be willing to give that.\\xa0 Right?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 We’ll have that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, we could get you that information.\\n\\nJeff, please?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, OPEC is meeting on Thursday —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and they have said that they are willing to make a cut in production if the U.S. chips in as well, which suggests that they want you to ask U.S. producers to do an orchestrated cut.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, you’re the first one that’s told me that.\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 We’ll have to make that decision.\\xa0 And maybe we will, maybe we won’t.\\xa0 But we’ll have to make that decision.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But do you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think the cuts are automatic.\\xa0 If you’re a believer in markets, I can guarantee you there’s a cut from pre this condition.\\n\\nYou know, look, this happened because of the virus.\\xa0 The virus knocked out 40 percent.\\xa0 It was — it went down in one hour.\\xa0 I mean, literally, when places close up, you’re talking about a 40 percent cut.\\n\\nNo, I think it’s happening automatically, but nobody has asked me that question yet, so we’ll see what happens.\\xa0 I’ll —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But you would —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’ll let you know Thursday evening.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 All right, that’s the deal.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But you would consider asking U.S. companies to refuse —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think it’s automatic because they’re already cutting.\\xa0 I mean, if you look, they’re cutting back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But OPEC is asking for a signal —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Because it’s — its market, it’s demand.\\xa0 It’s supply and demand.\\xa0 They’re already cutting back, and they’re cutting back very seriously.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But if OPEC is asking for a signal from the U.S. —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, nobody has asked me that.\\xa0 So, if they ask me, I’ll make a decision.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 But I’ll — but again, it’s happening anyway.\\n\\nYes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 In light of all the discussion about Prime Minister Johnson and his health, can you update us on the status of the second half of your physical that you were going to have this year?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, so I had a physical.\\xa0 The first half was very successful.\\xa0 I did it on a day when I was in the White House and we were able to do that, as the doctor reported.\\xa0 And I have some — the second half of the physical different.\\xa0 Probably is done at Walter Reed, and I’ll do that at the appropriate time, but I feel very good.\\xa0 And according to the doctor, very good shape.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And can I just ask you again on the idea of a national stay-at-home recommendation?\\xa0 What is giving you so much pause about making this recommendation?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I told you.\\xa0 I told you.\\xa0 He understood very well.\\xa0 I appreciate your understanding.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I understand the Constit- — but it’s not an order, just a recommendation.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s called the Constitution of the United States.\\xa0 And I’d rather have, if possible, for the governors to make the decision.\\xa0 If a decision was very necessary — and they have done a good job.\\xa0 And Tony said it better than anybody.\\xa0 They are — they are doing — they are doing what we’re asking them to do without having to put the seal on it.\\n\\nBut I will say, if I thought it was necessary, I’ll do it in a heartbeat.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you agree with the Georgia governor opening the beaches?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Opening what?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The beaches.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I haven’t seen — I’m going to have to see to what extent.\\xa0 I’m going to have to see how many people you’re talking about, are they crowded, are they packed, are they not packed.\\xa0 We’ll have to take a look at it.\\xa0 Right now, it’s very early for beaches in Georgia.\\xa0 So, right now, very early.\\xa0 So I’ll take a look at it.\\n\\nHe’s done a very good job as the governor.\\xa0 He knows what he’s doing, but we’ll have to take a look.\\xa0 It really does depend on, you know, how crowded it may be.\\xa0 But I will talk to him and I will ask him that question.\\xa0 I would ask him.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you said last week that you were considering travel restrictions around hotspots.\\xa0 Is that something that’s still on the table?\\xa0 And at what point —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re looking at it.\\xa0 And the airlines have been cutting their routes.\\xa0 You saw that yesterday.\\xa0 They announced big cuts in routes.\\xa0 We need some — some flights for emergency use for military people.\\xa0 We need some flights for medical people.\\xa0 And they are very few flights, as you know.\\xa0 And the flights that are going out are — I think they said they’re 3 to 4 percent full.\\xa0 You have 3 percent of the plane is occupied.\\xa0 So it’s — they’re very, very — generally, very, very empty planes.\\n\\nBut it’s good to have — it’s a — it’s a tiny amount of flights, relative to the overall.\\n\\nAnd we need them also for medical workers, for — otherwise, we’re going to have to do a whole big thing with our own planes.\\xa0 So they’re done for a reason.\\xa0 There’s also testing done when people get onto those planes and also when people get off the planes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, if I can follow up on this question of the HHS inspector general.\\xa0 And, by the way, her name is Christi Grimm.\\xa0 And it wasn’t so much her opinion, but they interviewed 323 different hospitals.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it still could be her opinion.\\xa0 But when was she appointed?\\xa0 When was she appointed?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m not sure when she was appointed.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Would you do me a favor?\\xa0 Let me know.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’ll — I’ll check on it.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no, let me know now.\\xa0 I have to know now, Jon.\\xa0 Let me know now.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But the point is —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Because we are doing an incredible job of testing.\\xa0 We are doing a better job than anybody in the world right now on testing.\\xa0 There’s nobody close.\\xa0 And other nations admit this.\\xa0 Other nations have admitted it very strongly.\\xa0 Other nations are calling us, wanting to know about our testing.\\xa0 Let me know when she was appointed, would you?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But specifically, what she was saying —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, is it —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — was that there had been a delay in the lab results.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, thank you very much.\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Only last week, there were multiple flights coming from China full of medical supplies.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Companies like Huawei and Alibaba has been donating to the United States —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 People I know very well.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — like 1.5 million N95 masks, and also a lot of medical gloves and much more medical supplies.\\xa0 So —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sounds like a statement more than a question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And Ambassador — Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai last night wrote an op-ed on New York Times, calling to cooperation with the United States.\\xa0 So are you personally working directly with China on medical supplies —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We just signed a trade deal.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — also fighting with the virus?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s the biggest deal probably ever made.\\xa0 And I hope they’re going to honor that trade deal.\\xa0 If they don’t honor the trade deal, then I’ll tell you a different answer, but I think they will.\\xa0 They’re going to spend billions of dollars for agriculture.\\xa0 They’re going to spend billions of dollars for many different things.\\n\\nWhereas China never spent money in our country —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Specifically on medical supplies.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0 — we spent money.\\xa0 We had a deficit — a trade deficit — with China for years of $500 billion, $400 billion.\\xa0 We had the biggest trade deficits in the history of the world with China.\\xa0 Now China is going to spend a lot — has agreed to spend $250 billion — many billions of dollars in our country, much of it going to farmers and manufacturers.\\n\\nSo, I’ll let you know.\\xa0 I mean, I hope they’re going to honor the deal.\\xa0 We’ll find out.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible) with China?\\xa0 Are you cooperating with China?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 Who are you working for?\\xa0 China?\\xa0 You work for China or are you with a newspaper?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m — no, I’m working for Hong Kong —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Who are you with?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Hong Kong Phoenix TV.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Who owns that?\\xa0 China?\\xa0 Is it owned by China?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s based in Hong Kong.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, is it owned by the state?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No, it’s not.\\xa0 It’s a private-owned company.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, good.\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nLook, I’ll let you know.\\xa0 I’ll give you a good answer to that in a few months.\\xa0 I want to just see what they do because it’s time for them to help us.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 It’s time right now for China to help us, and hopefully they do.\\xa0 And if they don’t, that’s okay too.\\n\\nBut we signed a deal.\\xa0 It was signed in — with great goodwill and spirit.\\xa0 And it’s time that our farmers benefitted, our manufacturers benefitted, and we’ll see whether or not that deal is honored.\\xa0 And I think it will be because I know President Xi, who I like and respect.\\xa0 And I think he will honor the deal he made with us.\\n\\nIt just went into effect four days ago.\\xa0 I will see whether or not.\\xa0 In fact, I called up just a little while ago.\\xa0 I said, “How are the farmers doing with respect to China?\\xa0 Are they buying the product as anticipated?”\\xa0 And the answer was, “Yeah, I think so.”\\xa0 But it wasn’t the most positive, but it was — it was starting.\\xa0 It was starting.\\xa0 The deal just started.\\n\\nSo I’ll let you know.\\xa0 But, you know, for many, many years, China ate our lunch because we had people in this position that I’m in right now that allowed China to get away with absolute murder, and it should have never happened.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What about fighting the coronavirus?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But we are — we are now dealing with China.\\xa0 We’ll see what happens.\\n\\nYeah.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Wait.\\xa0 Wait.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’ll tell you when she was appointed.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 How many do you want to ask?\\xa0 How many do you want to ask?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So I just wanted — I was going to answer your question you asked me.\\xa0 She was appointed in January of this year to her current position —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — as the principal deputy inspector general.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 We’re going to take a look at it.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I know you don’t want to talk about —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On the issue of —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Don’t — don’t interrupt.\\xa0 He’s — he’s talking.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On the issue of small-business loans, sir, you said that businesses have applied for $40 billion in loans.\\xa0 But can you tell us how much of that money has actually gone out to the small businesses?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I can’t tell you, but I know it goes out very quickly once the loan application is approved.\\xa0 And the process is very fast.\\xa0 And you have to understand: These are banks, and that’s what they do.\\xa0 But they were swamped.\\xa0 They were actually swamped.\\n\\nOkay, go ahead.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I know you don’t want to talk about the inspector general report, but testing is still a big issue in this country.\\xa0 When can hospitals expect —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Put the — put the slide up again, please.\\xa0 Just put it up.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 When can hospitals expect to receive a quick turnaround of these test results?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Are you ready?\\xa0 Are you ready?\\xa0 Hospitals can do their own testing also.\\xa0 States can do their own testing. \\xa0States are supposed to be doing testing.\\xa0 Hospitals are supposed to be doing testing.\\xa0 Do you understand that?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But it takes a while for the —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re the federal government.\\xa0 Listen —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — results to come back.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re the federal government.\\xa0 We’re not supposed to stand on street corners doing testing.\\xa0 They go to doctors.\\xa0 They go to hospitals.\\xa0 They go to the state.\\xa0 The state is a more localized government; you have 50 of them.\\xa0 And they can go — 50 within here; you also have territories, as you know.\\xa0 And they do the testing.\\n\\nAnd if you look at the chart, if you take a look — did they put it up?\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Just take a look.\\xa0 And these are testing and the results are now coming in very quickly.\\n\\nInitially speaking, the tests were old, obsolete, and not really prepared.\\xa0 We have a brand-new testing system that we developed very quickly, and that’s your result.\\xa0 And you should say, “Congratulations.\\xa0 Great job” — instead of being so horrid in the way you ask a question.\\n\\nPlease.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, today —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I’d love to have the Admiral speak to that question.\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 That’s a great idea.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 So, I can talk a little bit more about testing later on, but as the President said, 1.79 million tests have been done.\\xa0 And this does not count the hundreds of thousands of tests that are done within hospitals that are now currently not reporting.\\xa0 So I’m sure we’re well over 2 million.\\n\\nThat inspector general report was done here — 23rd and 24th — during our ramp-up period, quite a long time ago.\\xa0 There was clearly — and it’s hard to interpret the report because it mixes up all kinds of things — but clearly, there was complaints by some hospitals of a backlog.\\xa0 Probably had sent out tests.\\n\\nAnd that is true.\\xa0 There were several days of backlog at some of the major labs that have been taken care of.\\xa0 We know now that the ACLA labs now have a 24- to 48-hour turnaround.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They do.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 They’re doing well over 100,000 tests a day.\\xa0 We now have the Abbott machine; that’s point of care.\\xa0 That’s 18,000 of those instruments throughout the country.\\xa0 The Cepheid machine is now all across the country with a 45-minute turnaround on.\\n\\nSo we have worked directly with many of the hospitals that have their own laboratory-derived tests.\\xa0 Some of those really, quite frankly, didn’t understand the regulatory freedom they have to use other different kinds of instruments or different kinds of reagents.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They do now.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 So — like they do now.\\xa0 Like they do now.\\xa0 And I’m on the phone with them all the time to make sure that everything is clear.\\xa0 We have a 24-hour call number.\\xa0 But that’s what it was there for.\\n\\nAnd I don’t know the inspector general.\\xa0 I don’t know that person.\\xa0 I tell you one thing I have a problem with: If there was such a problem that she knew about or he knew about on March 23rd and 24th, why did I find out about the test from them on the —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He’s the one in charge.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 — on the news media at 8 o’clock this morning?\\n\\nIf there was a problem, I think you’re ethically obliged to tell me where that is so we can interact with it like I do every single day.\\n\\nBut that’s a discussion for the future.\\xa0 I think testing is really in a good position right now, and I’d be happy to expand on some of the really good tests that are coming up.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 How long has that person been in government?\\xa0 Could I ask you that?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Did serve in the previous administration.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, you didn’t tell me that.\\xa0 Oh, I see.\\xa0 You didn’t tell me that, Jon.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 She was appointed for her current position in January of this year, by your government.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You didn’t tell me that.\\xa0 Did serve in the previous admin- — you mean the Obama administration.\\xa0 Thank you for telling me that.\\n\\nSee, there’s a typical fake-news deal.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, you asked me when she was — you asked me when she was appointed.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, look.\\xa0 Look —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I told you when she was appointed by your administration.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You’re a third-rate reporter.\\xa0 And what you just said is a disgrace.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nYou asked me — you said, “Sir, just got appointed.”\\xa0 Take a look at what you said.\\n\\nNow, I said, “When did they — when did this person — how long in government?”\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But, but —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 “Well, it was appointed in the Obama administration.”\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But her current job was in your administration, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much, Jon.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 You will never make it.\\n\\nGo ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On the ventilators —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Boy, that’s a terrible thing.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and maybe this is best for Admiral Giroir — but can you tell us today how many ventilators are in the federal stockpile?\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 I’m not going to tell you how many are in the stockpile, but I can tell you that we look at ventilator use granularly every single day, in every single state, and down to the hospital level.\\n\\nSo we have been able to meet and easily meet all the ventilator requirements that have been brought us — to us by the state.\\xa0 No one has not gotten a ventilator that needs a ventilator.\\xa0 And as far as we can project, looking at all models, every person who needs a ventilator will get a ventilator.\\n\\nI’m a ventilator doc, right?\\xa0 I’m an ICU physician for children.\\xa0 Spent every day of my life managing people on ventilators.\\xa0 This is my community.\\xa0 It’s also the Surgeon General’s community as an anesthesiologist.\\n\\nSo what we have in the stockpile, I think, is not a number that we — we give out.\\xa0 But we have thousands remaining in the stockpile.\\xa0 And now you’re seeing out of the — out of the appropriate American spirit that, when a state like Washington or California doesn’t need that ventilator, they’re doing the right thing by moving them around the country.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0It’s about 9,000, just so you understand.\\xa0 It’s about 9,000.\\n\\nAnd, by the way, you didn’t tell me also that this inspector general came out of the Obama administration.\\xa0 You didn’t tell me that either.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, everybody up here —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, please go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — worked in the Obama administration except for you and Vice President (inaudible)?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m looking, sir, at — just quickly here, I’m looking at this inspector general’s bio.\\xa0 She appears to have served in government since 1999.\\n\\nBut I was hoping to ask you about your call with former Vice President Joe Biden.\\xa0 Is there something that you learned on that phone call?\\xa0 And has that changed your thinking —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I understood his views before the call.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But has that changed your opinion about speaking to people like —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I just think he’s a very nice — I think he’s a nice man.\\xa0 I’ve always thought he was a nice man.\\xa0 I’ve — I don’t know him.\\xa0 I don’t know if I ever spoke to him before, other than to say hello.\\xa0 But I think he’s a nice man.\\xa0 We had a very nice call.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And do you want to seek now the counsel of some of your predecessors — George Bush, Barack Obama?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, but we may — no.\\xa0 Not really.\\xa0 We may — we’re doing a great job.\\n\\nHey, I inherited — we, this administration — we inherited a broken system, both militarily, but we’ve rebuilt our military where we now have so much ammunition, whereas you remember a very important general said, “Sir, we have no ammunition.”\\xa0 They wanted to save money on ammunition.\\n\\nThey didn’t want to save money because they spent money like nobody ever spent money.\\xa0 But you know what?\\xa0 We now have a great military rebuilt.\\xa0 And we have so much ammunition, we don’t know what to do with it.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 And that’s a nice feeling to have.\\n\\nBut they also gave us empty cupboards.\\xa0 The cupboard was bare.\\xa0 You’ve heard the expression: “The cupboard was bare.”\\xa0 So we took over a stockpile where the cupboard was bare and where the testing system was broken and old.\\xa0 And we redid it.\\n\\nAnd, frankly, it would be okay for a small event but not for a big event.\\xa0 And they had a chance to do it.\\xa0 Somebody said that a certain person — I won’t tell you, but a certain person said this will happen.\\xa0 And that’s true.\\xa0 The problem is that person never did anything about it — previous administrations.\\xa0 In previous admin- — they never did anything about it.\\n\\nYou know, we all know all about pandemics and all of the things that we’re seeing now, but nobody thought it was going to happen.\\xa0 And if we did think it was going to happen, the problem is nobody did anything about it.\\n\\nWe did.\\xa0 We have rebuilt the system.\\xa0 And now we’re a fine-tuned machine.\\xa0 We built thousands of hotel beds for New York.\\xa0 We moved a ship in that now we’re going to make for COVID — COVID-19.\\xa0 We are going to make it so that people having this horrible thing happen to them will be able to use the ship.\\xa0 The ship, as I said, is going to be shared with New Jersey — New York and New Jersey.\\n\\nWe’ve done things that are incredible.\\xa0 When you build — what was it?\\xa0 Eighteen hospitals.\\xa0 We built 18 hospitals.\\xa0 We built medical centers all over the country.\\xa0 And when you have Gavin Newsom and other governors who really have been very nice and generous in their statements — because they make the statements to the press, not just to my face.\\xa0 Others tell us how great we’re doing — like the call that Mike had today.\\xa0 I heard from other people that were on the call; they said it was incredible.\\xa0 It was two hours, and it was — everything was positive.\\xa0 They were so happy with what we’ve done.\\n\\nAnd we’re ready to do more if they need it, because we’re ready to march.\\xa0 The Admiral can tell you: We are sitting there with 9,000 ventilators and we’re ready to march when we see that.\\xa0 We can move quickly.\\xa0 As soon as we see that need, we can move very quickly.\\xa0 We’re ready to march.\\xa0 We built a great system.\\n\\nThe problem is, the Democrats — like a guy like Chuck Schumer, who’s a total lightweight, by the way; I’ve known him for a long time.\\xa0 He’ll say, “Why don’t you put a military man in charge?” \\xa0A military man?\\xa0 I have all military men.\\xa0 This man is doing an incredible job.\\xa0 We have two admirals, numerous generals.\\xa0 We have the Army Corps of Engineers.\\xa0 We have FEMA.\\xa0 We have this whole force that like nobody has ever seen before.\\xa0 We have a great military operation and they’ve done an incredible job.\\n\\nAnd honestly, people should respect — because nobody has ever seen anything like what we’ve done.\\xa0 And what they end up — what — forget about me; don’t worry about me.\\xa0 I get — I will only get bad — if I say, “How many ventilators do you need, Governor?”\\xa0 “A thousand would be great.”\\xa0 I said “Nope, I’m going to send you 10,000.”\\xa0 And then you’ll call up from the media.\\xa0 You’ll say, “How did Trump do?”\\xa0 “We’re not happy.\\xa0 He didn’t send us enough ventilators.”\\xa0 Because that’s called politics.\\n\\nBut if you look at what’s happening, that — and I’m even surprised.\\xa0 The governors are saying all good things.\\xa0 But the Democrat governors, and a couple of RINOs — frankly, they’re RINOs.\\xa0 It’s all they are — one RINO, in particular.\\xa0 But the governors are saying great things.\\n\\nHe had a call that lasted two hours today.\\xa0 I heard about the call, not just from Mike.\\xa0 It was a perfect call.\\xa0 Now I’m sure you were on the call, even though you’re not supposed to be.\\xa0 I’m sure you were on the call — meaning some of the media was on the call, because they’re constantly reporting the call.\\xa0 If they’re honest, they will say it was a great call.\\n\\nOkay.\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Next question, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Here we go.\\xa0\\xa0Here we go.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You didn’t mention the hospitals that were built in New Orleans and Dallas today, but you have mentioned them a number of times previously.\\xa0 There seems to be some concern in Texas that they might lose the hospital in Dallas if it’s not used —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re never going to do anything that hurts Texas.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — if it’s not used yet.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re only — we’re only helping Texas.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How patients is there —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 By the way, the governor is doing a great job over there with the situation.\\n\\nAnd Texas is so big, you have some parts of the state that are affected, other parts that aren’t affected at all.\\xa0 You know, it’s an incredible place.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But do they keep this hospital, even if it’s unused?\\xa0 Or is the federal government going to shift those resources elsewhere?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, we’re going to use whatever we need, and we’re doing it totally in conjunction with the governor.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 We’re doing it in conjunction with your Texas governor, who’s done a fantastic job.\\xa0 Great.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I ask what — Governor Abbott also has set up checkpoints at the border to check people —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — coming in from Louisiana.\\xa0 We’ve seen checkpoints in Florida, other state borders.\\xa0 Americans are not really —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Very few people are coming through our border.\\xa0 And you’ll be happy to know we’re up to mile 161 of the wall.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No, no, I’m talking about internal borders between states.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, I see.\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Americans are not used to seeing —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But on the border between Mexico, we have 161 miles of wall.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 We’re not — but I’m talking about internal borders.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, good.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Americans don’t — they’re not used to seeing border checkpoints between states.\\xa0 How much longer — and is that something that states have to (inaudible)?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I mean, look, you — first, you want us to call eight governors and tell them to do something.\\xa0 And then you’re complaining that another governor is so strict that he actually checks the borders.\\xa0 I understand why he’s doing that: because he knows who he has and he doesn’t want people coming in if they should maybe, you know, not be to — to the liking of the doctors.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is the role — is the role of the federal government to decide when borders are closed —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I think it’s — look, he’s done a great job.\\xa0 He’s done a great job with this case, as have many other governors.\\xa0 But he’s done a great job.\\n\\nOne of the things I thought you were going to say is we’ve been very tough on our southern border, as you know.\\xa0 Very very tough.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And another one for Dr. Fauci.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And part of that is because of the fact that we have so much — you know, when you talk about 160 miles of new wall, nobody is coming through that.\\xa0 Nobody.\\xa0 Not even close.\\xa0 And we’re building it rapidly.\\xa0 We will have — early next year, we’ll have close to 500 miles of wall, which is what our goal was.\\n\\nPlease go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You mentioned Senator Schumer just a moment ago.\\xa0 He had a conference call today and he said that he believes that a COVID four relief bill will be necessary.\\xa0 Do you share that belief?\\xa0 And what would be contained in such a bill?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know necessarily, but I certainly want to listen.\\xa0 And what I want to do is two things: a real infrastructure, not a Green New Deal.\\xa0 You know, the carbon footprint.\\xa0 I’m not looking for the carbon footprint.\\xa0 We want to put people to work.\\n\\nBut a real — and, frankly, for so many years, we’ve let our infrastructure go to hell because we were wasting all our money in the Middle East and other places.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 I want to rebuild our country.\\xa0 I don’t want to rebuild — we’re tired.\\xa0 We’ve built — we’ve rebuilt, if you call it that — or destroyed, frankly.\\xa0 What we’ve done is so crazy.\\xa0 What we have done — the direction that this country has taken is so sad.\\n\\nBut we’re in the Middle East for $8 trillion.\\xa0 And if you want to fix a pothole in a highway, you can’t do it because they don’t want to give you the funds.\\xa0 So we want to have an infrastructure bill — a real one, like in the vicinity of $2 trillion — to completely rebuild our roads, our bridges, our highways, our tunnels, everything.\\xa0 And I’m totally open to listening to that.\\n\\nI’m also open to listening to and even putting forward — because we’re going to be putting something forward — more money for our citizens because they’ve gone through trauma.\\xa0 This has been trauma.\\xa0 This came out of nowhere.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 When — and I say it and I’ll say it again: We had the greatest economy in the history of the world.\\xa0 We had the most people working in the history of our country, almost 160 million people — far more than ever before.\\n\\nAnd then one day, our professionals correctly came to us and they said, “Sorry, sir, we have to close down our country.”\\xa0 And I said, “Say it again.\\xa0 Say it again.”\\xa0 “We have to close down our country.”\\xa0 And the entire world closed down because of this hidden enemy.\\n\\nNo, we — we are going to take good care of our people.\\xa0 It was not their fault.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 May I ask Dr. Birx to clarify something that she said on Saturday, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Yes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 May I ask Dr. Birx to clarify something that she said on Saturday?\\xa0 If I may, Dr. Birx —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Deborah?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — this is a question that comes from a radio colleague of mine, Tamara Keith.\\xa0 And on Saturday, it sounded like you said that for the next week people in high-risk areas should not even go to the market or the drugstore.\\xa0 Is that what you meant to say or is that accurate?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 You know, out of respect for every single healthcare worker that’s on the frontline, whether they’re a nurse, a doctor, a respiratory therapist, the phlebotomist, the persons who come in the rooms to clean — you know, out of respect for them, we as Americans should be doing everything possible.\\n\\nAnd what I meant was, if you can consolidate, if you can send one person, the entire family doesn’t need to go out on these occasions.\\xa0 We really need — this is a highly transmittable virus.\\xa0 We’ve been saying that we want every American to know that what they’re doing is making a difference, but we need to have solidarity of commitment from everyone to really — so, you know, maybe once every two weeks, we can do a grocery store and pharmacy shop for the entire family.\\n\\nSo it was really about: We have to do everything we can.\\xa0 I know — I see on the TV stations the level of human suffering in the hospitals.\\n\\nDr. Fauci and I and Admiral Giroir have spent our lives taking care of others.\\xa0 We need to take care of each other now as Americans and do everything that’s in those guidelines.\\n\\nAnd I know they’re tough.\\xa0 I know incredibly how tough they are.\\xa0 My grandchild of 10 months got a fever of 105 this weekend.\\xa0 I’m the doctor and I couldn’t get there.\\xa0 I mean, so I’m trying to explain to my daughter how to listen to her lungs.\\xa0 How to listen to her lungs and then the baby’s lungs.\\xa0 (Laughs.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So you did not get there?\\xa0 You did not get there?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 I did not go there.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good, I’m very happy about that.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 (Laughs.)\\xa0 Because of you two.\\xa0 (Laughs.)\\xa0 I mean, when you — you can’t —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 (Inaudible.)\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 — you can’t take that kind of risk with the leaders of the country.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Your grandson is okay?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Daughter.\\xa0 But she’s coming out of it.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s a lot of temperature, 105.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 But, you know, we’re all —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s a lot of temperature.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 — and that’s just an illustration.\\xa0 And I know you all are making sacrifices.\\xa0 And I guess I want everyone to take this seriously.\\xa0 So that was really a call of seriousness of how important this is and how we’re starting to see the impact.\\n\\nBut you can see what can happen when you come at this a little bit too late.\\xa0 And that’s why the message — before you see it, before you have to see your hospitals and your emergency rooms overwhelmed — it is on us, as a member of this community, of this country, to do everything possible to save one another.\\n\\nAnd so that was really what I was saying, and I will continue to say that because I do believe it’s making a difference.\\xa0 You can start to see it making a difference.\\xa0 But we have to do even more right now because that will predict where we are two or three weeks from now.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Deborah.\\n\\nAnd it is making a big difference.\\xa0 I saw where Governor Cuomo was a little bit upset today.\\xa0 Over the weekend, a lot of people outside and they were — they were pretty big groups of people.\\xa0 I saw that.\\xa0 I noticed that.\\xa0 And he wasn’t happy with that.\\xa0 And I could understand that.\\n\\nLook, we have a period — a short period of time –hopefully, it’s a short period of time to go. \\xa0And let’s get it done.\\xa0 Let’s get it done.\\n\\nKristen, did you have a question?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, I did.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Quick follow to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You’re so quiet today.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just got here.\\xa0 Apologies.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s because you have your own show now, right?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Laughs.) \\xa0No.\\xa0 Quick follow to the question about legislation.\\xa0 I know there’s discussion about a phase four —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — but are you also looking seriously at a second round of direct payments?\\xa0 And are you putting discussions on a potential phase four on hold for now while you pursue that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I was opposed to the way of distribution — money distribution — through, as you know, unemployment and through the state offices because they have very old com- — not all of them, but many of them — have 40- year-old equipment, as I’ve said.\\xa0 And it makes it very difficult.\\n\\nBut that’s what they’re looking — that’s what they to do.\\xa0 That’s the way it’s mandated to do.\\xa0 I thought it would be better if we did a direct payment system, but the Democrats really wanted it.\\xa0 And I think they had some — some help from a couple of people that I would have — had I spoken to them, I would have convinced them otherwise, I really believe.\\n\\nBut, so — but it’s getting out.\\xa0 And the federal government has done its job.\\xa0 All we can do is give this massive amount of money to the states.\\xa0 The states then are responsible to distribute it — a little bit like we’re talking about here.\\xa0 But the money will be right on time from the federal government, then the states have to do their job in getting it out.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Does there need to be a second round of those payments, do you think?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We could very well do a second round of direct.\\xa0 I would do it direct.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is that — is that under serious discussion right now?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s under — it is absolutely under serious consideration.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And in terms of Chuck Schumer, he also said he spoke to your chief of staff about potentially appointing a czar to oversee the supply chain.\\xa0 Is that something that you would consider doing?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we have people that are so talented.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Who is the point person for that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I know the people he suggested.\\xa0 They’re wonderful people.\\xa0 They worked here.\\xa0 They’re wonderful people.\\n\\nHe’s just doing that because it’s politics.\\xa0 Because you know what?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But who’s the point person right now, Mr. President?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We have many.\\xa0 Depending on what?\\xa0 In terms of testing, this gentlemen right here.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I can speak to that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 In terms — you know who the point person is?\\xa0 This gentleman right here.\\xa0 He’s the one in charge of the task force.\\xa0 But, Mike, you may want to tell him about the — because this is really a military operation.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Vice President, in terms of supply chain, in terms of getting out PPE —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Let — let me answer your question if I may —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — because it’s — it’s a very good question.\\xa0 And I spoke to Senator Schumer the night before last about just that.\\xa0 When the President signed a declaration of national emergency, he stood up FEMA as the lead agency implementing his policy to marshal a whole-of-government response.\\xa0 And, under FEMA, we provide federal support, the state manages the healthcare response and healthcare providers and first responders implement that response on a local level.\\n\\nOur lead on this issue in implementing it is Administrator Pete Gaynor.\\xa0 But the man managing all of the supplies — and you heard a presentation this weekend about our Air Bridge; what we also called a control tower — we literally, with Admiral John Polowczyk at the helm of our logistics effort, we have visibility now on all the supplies that are moving across this country and into this country from around the world.\\xa0 It really is extraordinary.\\n\\nI mean, when the President tapped FEMA to lead this effort, he — we essentially wanted to say we want to organize this in a military fashion.\\xa0 And we tapped, really, someone who is widely regarded as the number-one supplies and logistics military officer to do just that.\\xa0 He really is an extraordinary individual.\\xa0 Admiral Giroir has known him for a long time.\\xa0 And to be working with Admiral Polowczyk — we speak every morning.\\xa0 Our team reviews the data.\\xa0 We go over that with Administrator Gaynor and Admiral Polowczyk.\\n\\nWe talk about an extensive team that’s identifying supplies around the country and around the world.\\xa0 And then, as we were explaining to governors today, we work with the requests that are coming in from states, with a priority on the areas that are dealing with widespread outbreak — like the Greater New York City area, New Jersey, Louisiana — focus on Detroit, focus on Chicago and Illinois.\\n\\nAnd then what — what Pete Gaynor and Admiral Polowczyk are doing is directing those commercial distributors to send the resources directly to the frontlines of the battle against the coronavirus.\\xa0 It is an extraordinary system.\\n\\nAnd as I explained to the governors today, as I’ve explained to congressional leaders who’ve made a — what I think is a good-faith recommendation that we have — that we organize this in a manner of military logistics — it’s exactly what President Trump has done.\\xa0 And it’s what we’re doing every single day to make sure that healthcare workers, to make sure that the states that are dealing with a widespread outbreak of coronavirus can be confident that we’re going to spare no expense, leave no stone unturned, and use this extraordinary apparatus, centered in FEMA, to get the people of our country what they need, when they need it, to battle the coronavirus.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mike.\\n\\nAnd, Kristen, when Schumer makes a statement like that, he’s only doing it for politics.\\xa0 He knows.\\xa0 We have the best generals, the best admirals.\\xa0 We have the best people.\\xa0 These are incredible leaders.\\xa0 These are vibrant people.\\xa0 They’ve done such a good job.\\n\\nAnd again, you’ll get a tape of the conversation because I’m sure some of the governors probably had their favorite reporter listening to the conversation, even though they weren’t supposed to.\\xa0 But that’s happened before.\\n\\nJust so you understand, we had a call today that was a beautiful call — everybody friendly, everybody happy.\\xa0 They also know, in some cases, we’ll get them a little bit more.\\xa0 And if they need it, we’ll get them a lot more, depending on where this monster is going.\\n\\nBut when Schumer does that, take a look — take a look at the past —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, he’s not the only one, to be fair, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, you know, you’re going to have to tell me who.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There are other people who have raised that — that point.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0They certainly don’t\\xa0— well, yeah, some Democrats, because they view this as a campaign issue, they want to make Trump look as bad as they can because they want to try and win an election that they shouldn’t be allowed to win, based on the fact that we have done a great job.\\n\\nWe built the greatest economy in the world.\\xa0 I’ll do it a second time.\\xa0 We got artificially stopped by a virus that nobody ever thought possible.\\xa0 And we’ve handled it, and we’ve built a team, and we’ve built an apparatus that’s been unbelievable.\\n\\nTake a look at the swine flu.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 That’s H1N1.\\xa0 Take a look at that.\\xa0 And it’s not the other way around, by the way.\\xa0 It’s H1N1.\\xa0 Take a look — you know what I mean by that.\\xa0 Take a look at the swine flu.\\xa0 It was a disaster; 17,000 people died.\\xa0 The other administra- — they didn’t even know — it was like they didn’t even know it was here.\\xa0 And that was peanuts compared to what we have, in terms of the power, the magnitude of what we’re going through.\\xa0 This is attacking 182 countries, simultaneously.\\n\\nSo Schumer is just all about politics.\\xa0 I’ve known him almost all of my adult life.\\xa0 And he’s — he’s a disgrace.\\xa0 In many ways, he’s a disgrace.\\xa0 And he knows it’s (inaudible).\\xa0 He just wants to do that.\\xa0 But he knows the job we’re doing.\\n\\nEverybody is amazed at the job we’re doing.\\xa0 And the public is starting to find out.\\xa0 They’re starting — you know, one of the reasons I do these news conferences — because if I didn’t, they would believe fake news.\\xa0 And we can’t let them believe fake news.\\xa0 They see us up here.\\xa0 They see us with admirals.\\xa0 They see us with this talent.\\xa0 They see the job that Mike Pence has done, which has been an unbelievable job.\\xa0 An unbelievable job.\\n\\nI put him there.\\xa0 I thought he’d do well.\\xa0 He did great as the governor of Indiana, and I thought Mike would do well.\\xa0 He’s done much better than well.\\xa0 And he gets along with people, I think, much better than I do.\\xa0 Because I like people being 100 — Mike can put up with things that — sometimes I say, “It’s amazing that he can put up with it.”\\xa0 But he’s done an incredible job and so has the entire team.\\n\\nThis is a military operation.\\xa0 And again, we built 2,900 beds in Javits Center.\\xa0 We — we built medical centers in New York.\\xa0 In Chicago, we built 1,000 beds — much more now — in McCormick Place.\\xa0 That’s their big convention hall, the equivalent of Javits convention hall.\\xa0 Big McCormick Place. Fantastic place.\\n\\nBy the way, the mayor of Chicago — at least on the phone — is extremely happy with what we’re doing.\\xa0 She’s thanking us.\\xa0 Has a great relationship with Mike.\\xa0 Thanking us.\\n\\nAnd I just wish the politicians would say to you what they say to us.\\xa0 Really.\\xa0 And it’s a good question.\\n\\nDo you have one?\\xa0 Yeah, please.\\xa0 And we’ll get to you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, Mr. President.\\xa0 A national security question and then a question about Governor Cuomo.\\xa0 On the national security front, to the extent that you can comment on this: Your administration is making heavy preparations to move against the cartels in Latin America right now.\\xa0 And I — could you expand —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You said Latin America?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Could you expand on the reasoning of why now?\\xa0 Are their supply and logistics especially weak?\\xa0 Is it political?\\xa0 What’s the reasoning?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 It’s a good question.\\xa0 We’ve moved a tremendous number of boats and ships to the area of — you know, different areas of exactly where you’re talking about — because we are tired of drugs pouring into our country from other places.\\xa0 And we’re tired of seeing drugs pouring into different parts of Latin America, South America, and just coming into our country.\\n\\nNow we’ve got them stopped at the border and they’re trying to do it by sea.\\xa0 So we stop them at the border with — and, frankly, with the help of Mexico.\\xa0 Mexico, right now, has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border.\\xa0 They never had any soldiers. They’re doing that because I’ve asked them to do it.\\xa0 That’s the only reason they’re doing it.\\xa0 They have 27,000 soldiers.\\n\\nSo now they’re trying to bring it in by boat and by ship — the drug lords and the people doing drugs — and trying to destroy our country from inside with drugs.\\xa0 And we’re hitting them very, very hard.\\xa0 And that’s why we’re doing that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are there other illicit activities that U.S. assets are targeting or —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Say it?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is it beyond narcotics?\\xa0 Are there other illicit activities that U.S. assets are targeting?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, there are — there are the activities of human trafficking, and especially with respect to women.\\xa0 And, as you know, proportionally, it’s mostly women.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible) —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And it’s a horrible thing.\\xa0 It’s a horrible thing.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — just particularly opportunistic?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And there’s never been a time like it.\\xa0 And it’s because of the Internet.\\xa0 And this is all over the world. But, for the most part, they’re coming through — in this country, they’re coming through the southern border.\\xa0 But we’re hitting them very hard.\\xa0 They have tremendous illegal trafficking in women — and children also, but mostly in women. And it’s illegal.\\xa0 And it’s horrible.\\xa0 And it’s disgraceful.\\xa0 And I’ve seen things that are an absolute disgrace.\\xa0 And we’re trying to knock them out, and we’re knocking them hard.\\n\\nAnd again, I want to thank the President of Mexico because he has really stepped up to the plate.\\xa0 Twenty-seven thousand soldiers.\\xa0 They’ve never had any soldiers on our border.\\xa0 And I did that because the Democrats will not approve anything to stop — because they want to have open borders.\\xa0 They want to have all these people flowing through our border.\\xa0 And, in many cases, they’re sick.\\xa0 They have problems that we — you don’t want to know about.\\xa0 Or they’re criminals, in many cases.\\xa0 Not in all cases, but in many cases.\\xa0 And they don’t want to have bor- — they want to have open borders.\\xa0 They want to have sanctuary cities.\\xa0 So they protect criminals.\\xa0 And I don’t want to have it.\\n\\nAnd Joe Biden does want to have that also, as you know, because he said that during numerous debates.\\n\\nI want to have strong borders, and I don’t like protecting criminals with sanctuary cities.\\xa0 But we’re doing it for drugs. We’re doing it for human trafficking.\\xa0 We’re doing it because you have to do it.\\xa0 We either have borders or we don’t have a country.\\n\\nAll right.\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On Governor Cuomo, why did he move —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, on the question of antibody testing — which is FDA approved now, but not widely available yet — I know the Admiral said, by May, expect to have millions available.\\xa0 How are you going to prioritize who’s going to get the antibody tests?\\xa0 And what does — what is that going to show you?\\xa0 Do you think that’s going to be immunity?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 I mean, I have an answer, but I’d rather have the Admiral answer that.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIRIOR:\\xa0 So, let me clarify — and I know you probably understand this — is the antibody test does not tell you if you have the active virus in your nose.\\xa0 If you’re positive for the antibody, it strongly implies — it means that you have had the virus before.\\xa0 And to the degree that we know of medical knowledge, you will probably — highly probably — be protected against getting the virus again in the future.\\n\\nSo I want to make something clear: There’s no antibody test approved.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 “Approved” is not a word we talk about.\\xa0 There is a test or two that has received emergency use authorization, and many, many — many others out there that have not gone that way yet.\\n\\nAnd I want to take this opportunity to caution: There is a very consolidated effort between the FDA, CDC, NIH to validate some of the tests that are on the market right now, because it is very important that they actually do what they say they do.\\xa0 And we have reason to believe that not all of them are going to perform well.\\xa0 I don’t know the primary source, but the Financial Times just reported that the UK had 17.5 million antibody tests that they bought, and none of them work.\\n\\nSo we’re not going to get in that situation.\\xa0 We’re going to be very careful to make sure that when we tell you you’re likely immune from the disease, you’re really — that test really said that.\\n\\nNow, I will also make a statement, and I’m — there’s a lot of work on here, and I’m very excited about it.\\xa0 As opposed to the test for a novel virus, the antibody-type tests are very sophisticated technology, but they’re old technology.\\xa0 This, we expect to have many tens of millions of tests the first month that we are really sure that the test makes sense.\\n\\nSo this — this allows for surveillance screening — and Dr. Birx is one of the world experts — to understand is 1 percent, 5 percent, 30 percent of Americans have been infected.\\xa0 But it also allows us to have very widespread — tens and tens of millions of people screened with a finger prick on the spot.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And by when?\\xa0 Just to be — by May you’re saying this will happen or when —\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 So — so we’re — science doesn’t run on rails.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 So we need to make sure that the FDA, the NIH — which they’re actively doing right now — assure that the tests that they’re testing really do perform the way they should.\\n\\nAnd if things work out the way we believe they will, we will have millions on the market by May — in a sophisticated way, in a prospective way — that we get the surveillance we need.\\xa0 We can test people to see if they’ve been exposed, immune, and go back to work.\\xa0 And a combination of that kind of test with the current kind of tests we have now is how America opens back up again.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And how do you prioritize who gets those tests?\\xa0 I mean, tens of millions — we’re a country of 300 million.\\xa0 How do you determine who you’re going to have have that test?\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 Well, we are having active discussions under the leadership of Dr. Birx and the task force.\\xa0 But you can imagine how that is, right?\\xa0 But with tens and tens and tens of millions of tests per month that are available, you could really do wide- — very widespread testing.\\n\\nBut let me just give you an example.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Which nobody else can do, by the way.\\xa0 No other country can do it.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 I’ll just give you one example.\\xa0 It would be very important to know if the virus is still circulating here — whether, for example, a healthcare worker or a long-term-care nursing home worker is immune from the virus and can’t carry it.\\xa0 Very, very important to protect our elderly in that situation.\\xa0 But also, if you haven’t been exposed, to make sure that you really take precautions and maybe take care of the people who don’t have the virus — and you don’t have the virus.\\n\\nSo there are very — it’s complex, but it’s not complicated on how you go about looking at this in different segments of society.\\xa0 And I don’t want to take too much more time to the podium, but antibody tests are a different thing.\\xa0 They’re coming — we’re highly confident that this can be scaled very rapidly and provide us a bit of information we just don’t have now.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Jeff, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, may I follow up on what you said?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 A few more.\\xa0 We’ll do a few more.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 May —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And then Mike is taking over, and you’re going to see some incredible work that’s been done.\\n\\nGo ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 May I please follow up on what you said with regard to Captain Crozier before?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You said you didn’t want to punish him for having a bad day.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He had a bad day or a bad — bad week.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Would — does that mean —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But I — I don’t — yeah, I want to — I’m going to look into it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What does that mean —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And I also — I also think our Navy Secretary — he’s a highly respected man.\\xa0 So sometimes that happens with people, and I’ll — I’ll take a look at it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But what does — what do you mean by that?\\xa0 Would you consider reinstating him?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He had a bad day.\\xa0 When he sends a letter out and he sends copies all over the place and it’s not a classified letter.\\xa0 And it was very disconcerting to the families of the people on the ship — were very disconcerting.\\xa0 So, number one, they get worried and scared.\\xa0 It was weak.\\xa0 We don’t want weak.\\n\\nBut I’m going to take a look because he’s — I think he — you know, looks to me like he’s an outstanding guy.\\xa0 I looked — I looked at his whole — just a little while ago, I looked at his file.\\xa0 And people have bad days and we’ll take a look at it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I guess my question is: What would you consider doing for him?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’ll take a look.\\xa0 I want to look, I want to speak also to the Secretary.\\xa0 I also want to speak to the Secretary of Defense, who is Mark Esper, who is doing a fantastic job.\\xa0 And we’ll — you know, maybe I can help the situation out.\\n\\nI mean, you guys are saying, “Why is the President getting involved and going…”\\xa0 Well, I like to solve problems.\\xa0 It’s a problem.\\xa0 You know?\\xa0 I — I don’t want to see men hurt, women hurt.\\xa0 I don’t want to see people hurt unnecessarily.\\xa0 Maybe we can solve it easily where, you know, it’s not life changing.\\n\\nBut he did — he did a bad thing, sending a letter out and many, many copies, as you know.\\xa0 I don’t know, I heard 28 copies.\\xa0 I heard a lot.\\xa0 That’s a lot of copies.\\xa0 Plus, the letter was five pages long.\\xa0 I haven’t read the letter, but I think it was five pages long, single spaced.\\xa0 That’s a lot of writing.\\n\\nYou know, he’s the captain of a ship.\\xa0 He’s the — he’s a very important person of a very expensive ship, a nuclear-powered ship.\\xa0 He shouldn’t be writing letters like that.\\xa0 But it happens.\\xa0 Sometimes, I’ll write a letter that I say, “I wish I didn’t send it.”\\xa0 Not too often, but it happens.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I follow up on that?\\xa0 Mr. President, can I follow up on that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Yeah, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A quick follow-up on that, because the Acting Navy Secretary — and I know you were asked about this, but I just want to try one more time.\\xa0 He did say, in remarks to soldiers on the USS Roosevelt, that Crozier was, quote, “too naïve or too stupid” to be in command if he didn’t think that writing that letter was a bad idea.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I don’t know want to comment on what he said.\\xa0 I — I understand.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you wish he had used different language, Mr. President?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s — it’s tough language, but I don’t want to — let’s not get into that.\\xa0 It’s tough language.\\xa0 Now, there are some people that think, “Oh, wow, he says it like it is.”\\n\\nLook, he made a mistake.\\xa0 He should not have sent that letter or he should have gone through his chain of command, which is the typical way of doing it.\\xa0 You know, he’s in the military.\\xa0 He’s a very important person in the military.\\xa0 He knows it better than anybody in this room what he should have done and I’m sure he feels he made a mistake.\\n\\nBut I’m going to look into it, and I’m going to see — maybe we can do something, because I’m not looking to destroy a person’s life who’s had an otherwise stellar career, as I understand it.\\xa0 I looked at his file just now because I’ve been seeing what’s going on.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Potentially reinstate him?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 If we can save — if we can save a person’s career — I don’t mind going after a person if they did something wrong.\\xa0 And, you know — but this was a mistake.\\xa0 He made a mistake.\\xa0 I’m not justifying what he did.\\xa0 He made a mistake.\\xa0 He shouldn’t be sending letters.\\xa0 He’s the captain.\\xa0 He’s a very important person in the military.\\xa0 You don’t send letters and then it leaks into a newspaper.\\xa0 Of all newspapers, that was a beauty.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 So you just don’t do that.\\xa0 So, it was a mistake.\\n\\nBut I may get involved.\\xa0 I’ll call Secretary of Defense and find out a little bit about it.\\xa0 And if I can help two people — two good people — I’m going to help them.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, your tone seems to have changed a little bit since Saturday.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Say it?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Your tone seems to have changed a little bit on the captain since Saturday.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 On the captain?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Has —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, it hasn’t.\\xa0 I mean, look —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But is it the news coverage or did somebody speak to you on his behalf?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, ready?\\xa0 I — I said — when you asked me and when the question was asked the last time, I said, “Shouldn’t have sent the letter.”\\xa0 I haven’t changed.\\xa0 He shouldn’t have sent the letter.\\xa0 And it should’ve — if there’s a letter, it should go classified and it should go to his superior.\\xa0 And he shouldn’t be jumping over his superior.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Why did you look at his file, sir?\\xa0 Did somebody ask you to?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So, I’m — it hasn’t changed, in that regard.\\xa0 The only thing that has played right up here with me is that I looked at his record.\\xa0 And he’s been an outstanding person.\\xa0 If he wasn’t, I wouldn’t even be talking about this.\\xa0 He’s been an outstanding person.\\xa0 He’s had a very exemplary military career.\\n\\nI mean, you know, he started off as a helicopter pilot.\\xa0 They called him “Chopper.”\\xa0 His name was “Chopper.”\\xa0 He was a great helicopter pilot.\\xa0 It’s a tremendous skill.\\xa0 I know a lot about helicopters.\\xa0 And then he went to F-16s or F-18s, and he was a tremendous pilot.\\xa0 And then — he’s very smart.\\xa0 He studied nuclear energy and he was fantastic — and very few people have the aptitude, they have the mentality to do that.\\xa0 Nuclear energy is very complex.\\xa0 Very — it’s very hard.\\xa0 Very few people can do it.\\xa0 And he did it well.\\n\\nAnd then he became the captain of a nuclear ship.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 He became — of a — a replacement costs — if you look at replacement costs: $18 billion of replacement cost.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 So he’s got — on a replacement-cost basis, an $18 billion ship.\\xa0 You know, the President Gerald Ford — very expensive.\\xa0 That’s, you know, the nearest thing I can think of.\\xa0 But they’re spending money on that one like nobody’s ever seen.\\n\\nSo, he made a mistake.\\xa0 He made a mistake.\\xa0 And maybe we’re going to make that mistake not destroy his life.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Does that mean you would reinstate him, Mr. President?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, a couple of more.\\xa0 A couple of more.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you mentioned medical professionals and compared them to soldiers going onto the battlefield.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Many doctors and medical workers today — some of them seeing pay cuts.\\xa0 They’re going into a sort of environment where they’re concerned about their own health, their family’s livelihood —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I know.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — if something were to happen to them.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Very much on my mind.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 As part of this phase four, are you going to prioritize —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It doesn’t have to be phase four.\\xa0 I think it could be a separate phase when it’s all over.\\xa0 Right now, I don’t think they want to think about it.\\xa0 These people don’t want to think about it.\\xa0 These people are incredible.\\xa0 They’re not thinking about, “How much am I getting paid?”\\xa0 These people are incredible.\\xa0 I’ve seen it.\\xa0 I see the spirit.\\xa0 I hear about it all the time from Mike, from the Admiral.\\xa0 I hear about it all the time.\\xa0 These people are incredible.\\n\\nWhen it’s all over, I do want to seriously think — maybe in the form of bonuses.\\xa0 These people are — what they’ve done is incredible.\\n\\nI just — I just admire the attitude and I’ve said it.\\xa0 I just — they walk into those hospitals and they are seriously — you know, one of the things that came up with the Comfort, the ship, is that when we — we fulfilled the request of Governor Cuomo and Governor Murphy — and they’re going to be splitting it.\\xa0 But, you know, a lot of the things happen to ships when you do the — you know, it’s a lot of — they didn’t want to do this.\\xa0 In fact, they specifically didn’t want to do this: have patients that were affected with this horrible disease or whatever — the plague — because, frankly, it’s a plague.\\xa0 That’s exactly what it is.\\xa0 You’d read about it in the old days.\\xa0 The plague.\\xa0 And that’s exactly what it is.\\n\\nBut we’re doing it.\\xa0 But when I see the bravery of these people walking through doors without their stuff — I mean, they’re half — they’re just getting — they’re not standing outside, “Hey let’s get ready.\\xa0 Let’s…”\\xa0 They’re running through doors, putting on the stuff.\\xa0 It’s not even on.\\xa0 I think it’s incredible.\\n\\nI’m telling you, the nearest thing I can think of is soldiers in battle and soldiers going right into battle, because that’s what they’re doing.\\xa0 It’s really — in many ways, it’s the same thing.\\n\\nAll right.\\xa0 How about one more?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, one more question.\\xa0 Mr. President, you may have seen this: The Masters Tournament has been rescheduled to November.\\xa0 Two questions: A, is that an outgrowth of your conversation that you had with sports commissioners on Saturday?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Could be.\\xa0 I hope it’s rescheduled.\\xa0 I hope — I hope football is able to start.\\xa0 I hope baseball can get to play a little bit.\\xa0 I hope basketball can maybe do their playoffs.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What about the — Mr. President?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I mean, hey, I have no — I have no interests or anything other than I want what’s good for the country.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What about the U.S. Open, which you’ve attended many times?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, a lot of people are tired — yeah, a lot of people are tired of looking at games that are five years old.\\xa0 I looked the other day, I saw somebody, I said, “Wow, he looks great.”\\xa0 I forgot.\\xa0 I said, “Oh, that was nine years ago.”\\xa0\\xa0 You know, I said, “He’s really in great shape.”\\xa0 Well, not in a great shape now, but he was in great shape then.\\xa0 It was nine years ago.\\n\\nYou know, you get tired of looking at 9-year-old baseball games and — and playoff games that took place 12 years ago.\\xa0 I don’t have much time to do that, frankly, but that’s what people are doing, and they want to see sports.\\xa0 Sports are a great thing for this country.\\n\\nAnd I hope football can start.\\xa0 And I told them, “I think you might be able to.”\\xa0 They may very well be able to.\\xa0 I hope they can start and I hope they can start with people in the stands.\\xa0 You know, we’re not going to be separated.\\xa0 But you have seats.\\xa0 Those seats are meant for people to sit next to each other.\\xa0 And when this virus is gone, people are going to be sitting next to each other.\\n\\nAnd just for the restaurant industry, so they understand, when the virus is gone, people are going to be sitting next to each other.\\xa0 One man said, “I have a 200-seat restaurant.\\xa0 It’s been great.\\xa0 But if I go by these rules, those 200 seats goes down to 60.”\\xa0 I said, “No, no.\\xa0 You have a 200-seat restaurant.\\xa0 That’s what you have.”\\xa0 But we have to wait till the virus goes away.\\xa0 It wouldn’t even do well at 60.\\xa0 Frankly, there’s a warmth to it also.\\xa0 There’s a warmth.\\xa0 But not when we have the virus in the air.\\n\\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.\\xa0 So I’m going to let our Vice President take over.\\xa0 He’s got some really interesting numbers, statistics.\\xa0 And I want to thank the Admiral.\\xa0 I want to thank Tony and Deborah and everybody else.\\xa0 I want to thank everybody that’s working.\\xa0 And I really do — I see a lot of tremendous things happening.\\xa0 And the therapeutics — the call I had today was one of the most exciting calls I’ve had in a long time.\\n\\nAnd again, I want to wish my best to the UK and the family of Boris Johnson.\\xa0 And we just hope he’s going to be okay because he’s — he’s a fine guy.\\n\\nThank you very much, everybody.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you, Mike.\\xa0 Thanks.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nA few updates on the activity of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, then I’m going to ask Dr. Birx to speak about what we’re seeing in the numbers.\\n\\nWe know we are at the beginning of what’s going to be a very tough week in America.\\xa0 But as Dr. Birx will reflect, because the American people have been embracing social distancing, putting into practice the advice of state and local leaders and the President’s coronavirus guidelines for our country, as Dr. Birx will describe, we are not only seeing remarkable progress in Washington State and in California, where the numbers remain low and steady.\\xa0 That’s a great tribute to the people of both of those states and to all of their dedicated healthcare workers.\\xa0 But we’re also beginning — we’re beginning to see a leveling just at the very beginning.\\xa0 And she’ll reflect on those in just a few moments.\\n\\nA couple of quick updates: At the present moment, the President has approved 50 major disaster declarations and will likely be issuing a disaster declaration for the state of Minnesota before the end of the day.\\xa0 We’ve distributed more than $4.1 billion to states.\\xa0 And right after our incredible healthcare workers, we couldn’t be more proud of more than 21,000 National Guard that have been activated and are working in states all across the country.\\n\\nDuring my conference call today, I learned that Governor Brian Kemp is actually using the Georgia National Guard to sanitize and clean up nursing homes.\\xa0 But National Guard are being deployed in a variety of ways all across the country.\\xa0 And to them and to the families of all these citizen soldiers, you have our admiration and our respect.\\n\\nAs the President mentioned, our focus remains on the New York metro area, New Jersey, Louisiana, and then, Michigan and Illinois.\\xa0 We’re watching every area of the country, but those are the priorities today.\\n\\nAnd in that spirit, I spoke today, as the President did, with Governor Cuomo of New York.\\xa0 The President made the decision to open up the USNS Comfort to COVID patients.\\xa0 And he also informed the governor of New Jersey that we would be taking New Jersey COVID patients.\\xa0 So now there will be two facilities: one at the Javits Center that’s all COVID, and in the USNS Comfort that will be managing COVID patients.\\n\\nAt the present moment, there — by this evening, there will be 2,179 medical military personnel in New York City.\\xa0 And over the next two days, that number will rise to 3,000.\\n\\nSpeaking with the governor, speaking with Mayor de Blasio, the President and I were informed that while we have surged ventilators, we have surged personal protective equipment, that sending in some relief for healthcare workers was vitally important.\\xa0 And so, again, I want to emphasize that those are medical personnel — doctors and nurses and medical assistants — who are on the scene now and will continue to arrive to a total number of 3,000.\\n\\nI spoke to Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey.\\xa0 New Jersey is very much in the forefront of the coronavirus in America, today.\\xa0 We want to — want to commend the governor for his extraordinary leadership in the state.\\n\\nDuring our briefing today, we learned about the progress that they were making and also about the governor’s decision to temporarily reactivate retired healthcare personnel in the state.\\xa0 And just as a reminder of all that we’re dealing with, this weekend, Governor Murphy told me that New Jersey surpassed the number of lives that were lost on September 11th — to the state of New Jersey.\\xa0 And it breaks our heart to think of that.\\xa0 And our hearts go out to all of the families of the more than 10,000 Americans who have succumbed to the coronavirus.\\n\\nWe also — as the President said, we express our gratitude to governors in Oregon and Washington State yesterday for donating ventilators to help the states at the epicenter of the coronavirus.\\xa0 Governor Gavin Newsom of California donated 500 ventilators.\\xa0 And I just learned that those will be going — 200 to the state of Maryland, 50 to the District of Columbia, 100 to the state of Delaware, 100 to Nevada, and we’ll also be deploying the remaining 50 to the Northern Marianas Islands and to Guam.\\n\\nAnd we want to thank Governor Gavin Newsom.\\xa0 The State of California has provided extraordinary and compassionate leadership for their citizens.\\xa0 They’re making progress there.\\n\\nAs the governor said the other day, they’re not out of the woods yet, but the numbers speak for themselves.\\xa0 And the generosity of the people of California and the governor is gratefully received.\\n\\nBeyond that — before I recognize Dr. Birx, let me — let me just say that at the beginning of this challenging time, we want to — we want to challenge every American to continue to do what every American can do.\\xa0 And clearly, what we see in Washington and California, and what we are just beginning to see elsewhere, is put into practice the social distancing recommendations of the coronavirus guidelines for America.\\xa0 Listen to your state and local authorities.\\xa0 We really do believe that while this will be a week of heartache, it also is a week of hope.\\n\\nAnd as we see some of the cases beginning to level, just for a day or two, it is our hope that what we have seen begin in the greater New York area and even in Louisiana and elsewhere will become a trend.\\xa0 But it only becomes a trend if every one of us continues to take ownership and continues to do our part for this “30 Days to Slow the Spread.”\\n\\nWith that, I’ll recognize Dr. Birx for the latest data.\\xa0 And then we’ll take questions.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 I think you heard very clearly our concern in the New York-New Jersey metro areas; this also includes Connecticut and Long Island.\\xa0 As we talked about, we did see a significant increase in Sussex County over the weekend.\\n\\nThe weekend numbers are always difficult — I want to be clear on that — because sometimes case reporting is not as accurate over the weekend.\\xa0 So we’ll be watching very closely today’s numbers and Tuesday’s numbers.\\xa0 We’re also very, of course, focused on the New Orleans metro area, and that includes the three parishes of Jefferson, St. John the Baptist, and New Orleans proper, and, of course, the Detroit area, which is Oakland and Wayne.\\n\\nAs we mentioned before, we’re continuing to track very closely out of concerns of it potentially reaching logarithmic phase in the Chicago metro area, the Boston metro area, the D.C. and Baltimore metro area, Indianapolis, the Denver area, and two regions of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia and the Pittsburgh area, as well as Dallas and Houston in the Texas area.\\n\\nI had a very encouraging call because we also don’t want to miss anything.\\xa0 Remember, I showed you a lot of states were very much under 25 and 50 cases for 100,000.\\xa0 There were some — a few standouts that we were concerned about, which was Vermont, New Hampshire, Idaho, and Montana.\\n\\nWe had excellent calls today with their health commissioners and their — really were able.\\xa0 They’re on top of the situation.\\xa0 These were micro outbreaks that occurred due to ski events and weddings and nursing homes, and they were able to describe in critical detail the incidents and how they’re tracking and tracing.\\xa0 So they are still doing full contact tracing through those areas.\\xa0 And I just want to applaud these.\\xa0 This is both a rural and metro problem, and I really want to applaud how many of the states, that may have smaller populations, are approaching this.\\n\\nThat gives us encouragement of how we can talk about beginning surveillance activities.\\xa0 At the same time, we’re following these very clear outbreaks and ensuring that there’s full supplies based on the very granular data that we’re utilizing.\\xa0 And I just want to thank the mayors and governors who get us that granular data and allow us to make these deeper interpretation across all of the United States.\\n\\nWe know each governor is concerned about their areas, but these metro areas cover different areas.\\xa0 So the Philadelphia area also includes southern New Jersey and Delaware, and so we have to really look at things very much as both the metro and the communities that surround those metros.\\xa0 And so all of those people, we ask you again, throughout the United States, to follow these very clear guidance.\\n\\nI want to just recognize both HHS — and you heard about the work that Admiral Giroir is doing, the work that Dr. Hahn, and Administrator Seema Varma — Verma are doing, and also Administrator Engels in the work of HRSA to really ensure that our federally funded clinics are actively engaged in all of these aspects.\\n\\nBut I also want to recognize the military: the Medical Corps, the Nursing Corps, and the Medical Subspecialty Corps.\\xa0 These were my brothers and sisters for 29 years.\\xa0 It is highly unusual for the active force to be called into a domestic situation.\\xa0 I think that shows you how seriously we’re taking this at the federal government level.\\xa0 In my 29 years in the military, I was never deployed domestically.\\xa0 So this is showing you how serious of an event we take this.\\xa0 If the military is deploying domestically, it is another reason for every American to be following these guidelines.\\n\\nFinally, CDC quietly launched a new website.\\xa0 It’s — if you go to CDC.gov and you go to “COVID-19,” you can find their surveillance data.\\xa0 This surveillance data is bringing together our influenza-like illnesses with their syndromic management databases so that you can track the respiratory disease across the United States.\\xa0 The states are used to using this system.\\xa0 It’s in emergency rooms.\\xa0 It’s in hospitals.\\xa0 It’s in doctors’ offices.\\xa0 And it gives you insight, and you can see very clearly influenza A peak, you can see the influenza B peak, and now you can start to see the respiratory disease from this current outbreak.\\n\\nThese are the systems that exist within the United States that will be strengthened in order for us to do comprehensive surveillance.\\xa0 So I just want to assure the American people: While we’re working on these outbreaks, we’re also working on bringing new systems together that have a comprehensive look across the country, building on the strong work of CDC as a public health institution so that we can work county by county, community by community, state by state to really understand where this virus is and where it will be, but also as an early alert for us in the future.\\n\\nSo I just want to assure the American people that as we’re working on the crisis of today, we’re looking to the future to ensure we have the systems in place to bring those early alert systems together while we work on the antibody testing and while we work on continuing, spreading, and increasing the diagnostic capabilities that you see presented here.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Deb.\\xa0 And Admiral Giroir spoke several times when the President was with us, so he’ll be here for questions as Deborah Birx will.\\n\\nBut Doctor — Dr. Fauci, your thoughts.\\xa0 And then we’ll — we’ll take some questions.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 No — no, actually.\\xa0 We’re —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 I just wanted to — okay, I will.\\xa0 (Laughs.)\\xa0 It related to something I said yesterday about that somewhat paradox of everything going up at the same time that the feeding into this engine of this virus is starting to show some signs.\\n\\nSo Governor Cuomo today reported an interesting data from New York, namely that the number of hospitalizations, the number of admissions to intensive care, and the number of requirements for intubations over the last three days have actually started to level off.\\n\\nSo, again, everybody who knows me knows I’m very conservative about making projections, but those are the kind of good signs that you look for.\\xa0 You never even begin to think about claiming victory prematurely.\\xa0 But that’s the first thing you see when you start to see the turnaround.\\n\\nThat doesn’t mean we don’t have a lot of work to do.\\xa0 That tells me — instead of saying, “Hm, that’s pretty good,” it’s, “We got there through mitigation.\\xa0 We cut off the stream of people who ultimately required hospitalization, required intubation, required all of the kinds of extreme methods.”\\n\\nSo we just got to realize that this is an indication — despite all the suffering and the death that has occurred — that what we have been doing has been working.\\n\\nSo the call that I say every time I get to this podium is, “Just keep it up,” because this is going to get us out of it.\\xa0 This is our best and only great public health tool.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And aren’t we starting to see that across many states?\\xa0 We’re seeing the level of hospitalizations and deaths is lower than what we anticipated.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Well, you’re going to see it most dramatically, Jon, in a place like New York where you see it goes up at peak, and then it will hopefully — and I think it will — come down.\\n\\nWhen you have places like Seattle, which did a — and Washington State — who did a really good job from the beginning, it never really did that.\\xa0 So they were able to keep it down.\\xa0 And on the charts that Dr. Birx showed, when you saw California and Washington State, they were fortunate they did a good job that it never really got out of hand.\\n\\nSo, again, this is a big country and you have a number of different metropolitan areas.\\xa0 I think, if we do it right, you’re going to see those who have not peaked will not peak, and those who have peaked — the New Orleans, the New York, New Jersey, Chicago, Detroit, and others — you’re going to see the same thing if we keep our foot on the accelerator.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Fauci, a quick follow-up.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Further questions for the team?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m following up Dr. Fauci’s comment earlier about what it’s like going to be coming back to normal and until there’s a vaccine that — there’ll be gradual steps towards restoring normalcy.\\n\\nUnder that — you know, short of a vaccine — does putting 80,000 people, fans, spectators in a sports stadium or 25,000 politicos in an arena for a political convention this summer make a lot of sense?\\xa0 Do those sorts of things require a vaccine to fully protect the American populace?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 No, I don’t think that you’re going to have to say that the country cannot get back to a real degree of normalcy until you absolutely have a safe and effective vaccine.\\xa0 It will be really evaluating the kinds of things.\\n\\nAnd that’s the reason why — it was discussed up here — why it’s so important to have an antibody test so you know what the penetrance is in society.\\xa0 And then we have a situation where we don’t ever want to get to have to mitigate.\\xa0 We want to be able to contain.\\xa0 And by the time we have to face what’s going to happen with this going back to normality, we will have in place the capability of identifying, isolating, contact tracing so that it never gets out of hand.\\n\\nUltimately, the showstopper will be obviously a vaccine where you can vaccinate people and you won’t have it.\\xa0 There’s going to be another issue that’s going to be important and it has to do with somewhat of a comparison, for example, with influenza.\\n\\nWe go through multiple cycles of influenza.\\xa0 There’s always a degree of background immunity in the population.\\xa0 I mean, that will ultimately happen if we get a situation where we get back to normal.\\n\\nNow, I hope we don’t have so many people infected that we actually have that herd immunity, but I think it would have to be different than it is right now.\\n\\nSo, again, remember, when you say “normalcy” — I mean, we could get back normally, economically and otherwise, without necessarily saying we’re going to forget about the virus.\\xa0 We have to pay attention to this because we’ve had a very bad experience with this virus.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Fauci, can I follow up on that, please?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I have a quick follow-up.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 And this is for the Vice President, for Dr. Birx, and Dr. Fauci.\\xa0 But —\\n\\nTHE VICE President:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — can you give us a sense of — and I know you don’t want to make any projections — but where we are with the numbers?\\xa0 Because we saw that horrible number today.\\xa0 More than 10,000 deaths now in the U.S.\\xa0 Are we on track for those best-case scenario numbers that you had laid out, the hundred thousand?\\xa0 Or are we potentially coming in lower than that at this point, given some of what you’re seeing?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 You know, it just gives me an opportunity to thank and respect the modelers who have really worked on this, because there’s — a large number of them have worked very hard on — and done a lot of predictions.\\n\\nAnd what we did is did — we did predictions of predictions.\\xa0 We like to integrate data.\\xa0 And so that’s where you come up with these numbers.\\xa0 I think Dr. Fauci and I both strongly believe that if we work as hard as we can over the next several weeks, that we will see potential to go under the numbers that were predicted by the models.\\n\\nAnd I think that is really two things: It is the extraordinary compliance of the American people and the diligence that they have mitigated with.\\xa0 Because remember, we are doing this strictly by behavior change.\\xa0 It’s very hard to change trajectory of viruses on just behavior change.\\xa0 We have had difficulty in our past doing that.\\xa0 So that’s what we’re doing and that’s what the American people are doing.\\n\\nBut the other side of that is the incredible insights that Washington State and others are providing on how to better care for the patients in the hospital.\\xa0 So those two pieces are coming together that could have a dramatic impact on the predictions of the mortality from this disease.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 So, I’m glad you asked that question because I’ve said it a couple of times here.\\xa0 I want to say it again.\\xa0 Repetition is good.\\xa0 Is that models are good; they — they help us to make projections.\\xa0 But as you get data in, you modify your model.\\xa0 And I’ve always said data always trumps models.\\xa0 Always.\\n\\nSo what I feel, and I believe that Dr. Birx also feels, that I don’t think anyone has ever mitigated the way I’m seeing people mitigate right now.\\xa0 This has never happened in this country before.\\xa0 So I am optimistic — always cautiously optimistic that if we do what I’ve been talking about over the past few minutes, we can make that number go down.\\n\\nI don’t accept every day that we’re going to have to have 100- to 200,000 deaths.\\xa0 I think we can really bring that down, no matter what a model says, because when the data comes in, they’ll start to say, “You know, maybe you are essentially overshooting the model.”\\xa0 And I think that’s where we can go.\\xa0 That’s the reason why I like to always get up and tell the American people: It’s the virus doing what the virus wants to do, and it’s we, as a society, doing what we can do.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And let me just amplify that from a layperson’s perspective: The American people are doing it.\\xa0 I mean, the initial data, what we’ve seen in California and Washington, support the fact that the American people are doing these things, which is nothing short of loving your neighbor.\\n\\nI mean, the truth is, the threat of serious illness for most Americans is relatively low.\\xa0 But the threat of serious illness for seniors with underlying health conditions or anyone with an immunodeficiency is very high.\\n\\nAnd when we see Americans putting these principles into practice the way you all have been, it really means you’re considering others more important than yourself.\\xa0 And I have to tell you, for the President, for me, and for all of us, it’s deeply inspiring.\\xa0 We just need to continue to do it for all of these 30 days, and we’ll bring that number down.\\n\\nHow about a couple more?\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, Mr.\\xa0Vice President, when will you know — when do you think that you will know whether or not you will have to extend those 30-day guidelines, or if 30 days will be enough?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, the experts told us that somewhere around the middle of this month would be the peak.\\n\\nAnd as we begin to see a couple of days that might be the beginning of leveling, we’re going to — we’re going to watch that carefully and we’re going to bring that information to the President.\\xa0 But for now, the decision is, and the request of every American, is to continue to put into practice all of the President’s coronavirus guidelines, “30 Days to Slow the Spread.”\\n\\nAnd for all of you in areas that have been impacted broadly by the coronavirus: Listen to what your state and local authorities are asking you to do.\\xa0 It will protect your health, your family’s health, and it will save lives.\\n\\nLet’s do a couple more, and for our panel, if you’d like.\\xa0 Jeff.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This is more of a personal question.\\xa0 But, Dr. Birx, can you tell us if your granddaughter is okay?\\xa0 And —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 I’d like to hear it too.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Well, thank you.\\xa0 Due to her — the great care of my 91-year-old nurse mother and my daughter, she’s down to like 100 to 99 now.\\xa0 But it was three days of 104 and 105, which is — you know, babies can do that, but it’s very scary, especially when I couldn’t assure myself that she was fine.\\n\\nSo it was just some sleepless nights for me, and I think them, as they kept her fever down.\\xa0 So thank you for asking.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Did she have this — the virus?\\xa0 Or —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Oh, no.\\xa0 I’m sure it’s roseola or something.\\xa0 They have not been out of the house.\\xa0 They are not allowed out of the house.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 They’ve got two granddaughters under — one, two and a half almost; and one only 10 months.\\xa0 And my 91-year-old and 96-year-old.\\xa0 So no one is allowed in that house or out of that house because there’s too much precious cargo inside the house.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 How about — how about one more — one more question, and we’ll let you all —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 For whoever wants to answer this, it’s technical question.\\xa0 So FEMA says that it is in the process of distributing 90 percent of each state’s allocated supplies for the National Strategic Stockpile.\\xa0 And that allocation is determined based on population by the last census in each state.\\xa0 And the other 10 percent, it says, is going to frontline healthcare workers serving in the federal response efforts.\\nSo where — where are those healthcare workers in the federal response?\\xa0 And do you envision a scenario in which you could start giving states more supplies from the National Strategic Stockpile?\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You know, it’s a really good question.\\xa0 And let me say, the Strategic National Stockpile — and I’m going to have Admiral Giroir speak about his piece of that — is — has been largely deployed.\\xa0 We are continuing to replenish it in part with a small portion of what’s coming in from around the world.\\xa0 You’ve heard about our air bridge — now more than 50 flights that have been scheduled that are bringing millions of supplies into the United States.\\n\\nWhat we’re doing is taking less than 10 percent of that, put it into the Strategic National Stockpile so we have that to basically provide for states on an as-needed basis.\\xa0 But the other 90 percent that — that system that I just described earlier when the President was here — is working with the six major medical distributors in the country to deploy those resources to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Louisiana, Michigan, Illinois, the exact priority that you just heard Dr. Birx describe and that the data informs.\\xa0 And those decisions are being made every single day.\\n\\nAnd so while — while — if a hurricane hits Florida, or tornadoes or flooding tear through the state of Indiana, we’re very accustomed to FEMA coming in, drawing from the National Stockpile, and providing specific resources.\\n\\nIn this case, with a nationwide effort, what President Trump directed us to do was literally marshal the resources of the full economy to be able to make sure that we can meet the needs for personal protective equipment, ventilators, and all manner of supplies.\\xa0 And we’re doing that, in a small way, through the Strategic National Stockpile, but in the largest way, through that control tower system that Admiral John Polowczyk is running for us that is deploying those resources and making sure they’re going straight to where they need to go.\\n\\nAnd as I said earlier, those decisions are being informed by the data, and they’re literally being made by our team at FEMA on a daily and sometimes hourly basis.\\xa0 And we’ll continue to keep you informed, as we did today, about where some of those are going.\\n\\nBut let me let Admiral Giroir finish that answer.\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 I don’t really have much more to add to that.\\xa0 The Vice President is certainly well informed about that.\\xa0 And I want to assure you that all the sourcing around the world, if it’s there, we’re putting it in our supply chains.\\xa0 We’re buying more.\\xa0 Manufacturers are stepping up to the plate.\\xa0 And this is going not just by percent allocation, but it’s going to the exact places that need it, in the quantities that they need to take care of patients.\\n\\nAnd we want to make sure — this is a two-way street.\\xa0 We get the — get the data in from individual hospitals to know exactly what their burn rate is, exactly what they need.\\xa0 And we want to make sure that they feel comfortable that they’re going to have supplies, because they will.\\xa0 Because part of this is about potential shortages in other place — some places.\\xa0 Most of it’s about a fear of a shortage.\\n\\nIf I’m a physician in an ICU, and I’m not sure that it’s going to be there, that’s going to scare me.\\xa0 It’s going to scare my nurses.\\xa0 So we want everyone to have that assurance that we will provide you what you need over weeks, periods of time, exactly to your need.\\n\\nAnd Admiral Polowczyk and his team — and, again, it’s all military in there.\\xa0 I mean, he is the logistics guy for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, right?\\xa0 This is what he does.\\xa0 He is a wizard.\\xa0 He has a — there are more stars around me in the DOD part of the military than I’ve generally seen outside of the Pentagon.\\xa0 This is really being run as a military operation.\\n\\nI’m in the U.S. Public Health Service.\\xa0 So we’re part of HHS.\\xa0 The Surgeon General and I have the honor of running that service.\\xa0 We are shoulder-to-shoulder in the field, in the military hospitals with everyone else.\\xa0 There are only 6,100 of us; 3,000 are doing direct patient care on a daily basis.\\xa0 We take care of the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Prisons, those in detention at the border, et cetera.\\xa0 That’s what we do.\\n\\nThe other 3,000 — over 2,000 of those are in the field already, taking care of patients directly, and we have more going out the door every day.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And if I could just to follow up on that very quickly then.\\xa0 Is it even worth then governors writing into FEMA if they’ve already received their 90 percent allocation and you’re getting data directly from the hospitals to ask for more at this point?\\n\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 This has been a very cooperative interaction.\\xa0 I bet I talk to five governors a day, and we talk out — we talk out the issues and understand what they — what they perceive in their state.\\xa0 They often help us — help point us to particular areas that may — that they feel need more attention or that needs more communication.\\xa0 So it’s been very productive.\\xa0 I — you know, I have to look up what governor goes to what state because I’m not — that’s not my world.\\xa0 But it’s been a very productive interaction.\\xa0 So I think all of this is necessary.\\n\\nI’m on almost every governors call with the Vice President.\\xa0 They’re very meaningful.\\xa0 They’re impactful.\\xa0 They’re informative.\\xa0 They’re communicative.\\xa0 We talk to each other.\\xa0 But then we do get down to the individual hospital level, because when the rubber meets the road, you got to know what the docs, nurses, respiratory therapists — the people who clean the rooms, who are an important part of the team; I want them to come to every work saying, “You know, it’s not that I clean the room, I’m saving lives today.”\\xa0 And they are saving lives by keeping the viruses off the surfaces and reducing transmission.\\n\\nSo you’ve really got to get that granular.\\xa0 And we’re to a point with Admiral P’s — you have two admirals with the worst pronounced names in the world — so, Admiral P, Admiral G.\\xa0 But Admiral P’s team really has this covered down to the individual hospital.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And let me say, just by way of closing, because I thought — I thought that last question was helpful.\\n\\nWe’re interacting with governors every day, seven days a week, and we welcome that.\\xa0 And while there are some resources in the Strategic National Reserve — we spoke about ventilators; we have some 9,000 ventilators on standby — we also have this vast array through the commercial system that when we hear from governors, we’re identifying the needs.\\xa0 They’re working every day to identify their hospital capacity.\\n\\nWe went over governors today saying, “We need to know — we need to know what your capacity is, what your normal capacity is, what your surge capacity is.\\xa0 We need to understand what your equipment complement is across the state.”\\xa0 And governors have been doing this.\\xa0 They’ve been assembling that information.\\n\\nBut I want to tell you the governors across this country in both political parties have been doing a remarkable job.\\xa0 And the President is grateful and I’m grateful.\\n\\nAnd I just want to know that those healthcare workers that they’re serving, and the families that those healthcare workers are serving, can be confident that we are going to do whatever it takes to get them what they need, when they need it.\\n\\nAnd every governor is working in that regard, every hospital administrator is working in that regard, and the opportunity that we have — because the American people are stepping up so strongly and putting others ahead of themselves — in most cases, they’re acting in a way that that puts the health of others first.\\xa0 We’re — we’re more confident today than ever before that we’re going to be able to provide our healthcare providers and the states that are impacted by the coronavirus with the resources and the support they need to meet this moment.\\xa0 And we’re just going to continue to work our hearts out and make that a reality.\\n\\nYou know, I — but I have to end with just a reference to the healthcare workers.\\xa0 You’ve heard these doctors talk about them.\\xa0 They’re all healthcare people.\\xa0 You’ve heard about the President talk about them.\\xa0 You all have seen them.\\xa0 And to think what these healthcare workers, doctors, and nurses, and medical assistants are doing every day — it inspires us to get up early, to stay up late, to keep working to make sure they have what they need to be able to continue to do their job courageously.\\n\\nAnd I know I speak on behalf of every American when I say how grateful we are for each and every one of you.\\xa0 And in this very special Holy Week, I know millions of Americans are praying for our healthcare workers.\\n\\nI saw a picture that I sent out last night on Twitter.\\xa0 It was an article about a series of cities where doctors and nurses had paused to pray for the patients and the families that they were ministering to.\\xa0 And I just want to say to all those healthcare workers: I know there is a chorus of prayer going up every day for all of you.\\xa0 And with your continued courageous service, and with God’s help, we’ll get through this and we’ll get through it together.\\n\\nThank you all.\\n\\nEND\\n\\n7:51 P.M.

       "  'text': 'James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\\n\\nApril 5, 2020\\n6:59 P.M. EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, thank you very much, everybody.\\xa0 All these people have been working very, very hard today, I’ll tell you.\\xa0 For a long time, they’ve been working.\\n\\nBut before I begin, I want to express our nation’s well wishes to Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he wages his own personal fight with the virus.\\xa0 All Americans are praying for him.\\xa0 He’s a friend of mine.\\xa0 He’s a great gentleman and a great leader.\\xa0 And he’s — as you know, he was brought to the hospital today, but I’m hopeful and sure that he’s going to be fine.\\xa0 He’s a strong man, a strong person.\\n\\nToday, every patriotic American heart beats in solidarity with the incredible people of New York and New Jersey.\\xa0 They’ve really become a very hot zone, but some very good things are happening.\\xa0 In New York, the first time where the deaths were less from the previous day.\\xa0 That’s the first drop so far.\\xa0 So maybe that’s a good sign; it could be.\\xa0 And the hospital levels are starting to perhaps decrease.\\xa0 It’s been very short, but perhaps decrease.\\n\\nSo we wish Governor Cuomo and all of the people in New York great.\\xa0 And, New Jersey, your governor is doing a great job.\\xa0 He’s doing a great job in New Jersey.\\xa0 They got hit very hard.\\n\\nI just want to say that the full power of the American government and American enterprise — it really is.\\xa0 This is an all-out military operation that we’ve waged, and especially over the last number of weeks.\\xa0 Fifty states and territories have now been approved for major disaster declarations, which is very unusual.\\n\\nThanks to the Army Corps of Engineers, New York City’s Javits Center is now one of the largest hospitals in the United States.\\xa0 It’s designated for treatment of the virus patients and staffed by hundreds of federal medical personnel deployed from two Army hospital units, and they’re doing a great job.\\xa0 This was something that we didn’t expect to do, but they needed help in New York and we sent federal troops — not only troops, we also sent a lot of very talented doctors, nurses, first responders.\\xa0 People are now running Javits.\\n\\nAlso, as you know, the USNS Comfort, which is in New York — there’s been a lot of publicity about that coming in and all.\\xa0 That was not supposed to be for the virus at all, under any circumstances. But it looks like, more and more, we’re going to be using it for that.\\xa0 So we’ll see.\\xa0 That was supposed to be for people having other medical problems, but it’s very interesting because there are virtually no cars on the road, no motorcycles on the road, no — no anything on the road.\\xa0 Things that would normally be taken care of, we don’t see anymore.\\xa0 So we haven’t seen that in a long time.\\xa0 It’s, perhaps, a positive.\\n\\nBut the ship is ready.\\xa0 And if it has to, if we need it — if we need it for the virus, we will be using it for that.\\xa0 They’d prefer not, for obvious reasons, but if for any reason they need it, it’s ready, willing, and able.\\n\\nWe have the best doctors, the best military leaders, and the best logistics professionals anywhere in the world.\\xa0 And we’re orchestrating a massive federal response unlike anything our country has ever seen or done.\\xa0 We’ve never done anything like this.\\xa0 And, more and more, we’re using our medical people because of the fact that jurisdictions, states — in particular New York, New Jersey, the Connecticut area.\\xa0 Long Island now has become a hotspot — part of New York.\\xa0 We’re sending a lot of things, a lot of supplies, and now we’re sending personnel where it’s needed.\\xa0 Military personnel.\\n\\nAs of Tuesday, we’ll have deployed over 3,000 military and public health professionals to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and other parts of our country — 3,000 — and that number is going up.\\xa0 And we hope we’re seeing a leveling off in the hottest spots of them all.\\xa0 So we’ll see.\\xa0 You’ll be seeing that over the next few days.\\xa0 Let’s see what happens.\\xa0 But we’re prepared.\\n\\nIn the last seven days, FEMA has airlifted critical supplies and protective equipment from every corner of Earth.\\xa0 They’re coming from all over the planet, including from within the United States, where the equipment isn’t as necessary.\\n\\nSince last Sunday, cargo planes have delivered almost — listen to this — 300 million gloves, almost 8 million masks, and 3 million gowns.\\xa0 And many more fully loaded cargo planes are right now on the way.\\xa0 Three big ones landed today.\\xa0 And these supplies are being distributed directly to the hospitals and healthcare providers all across the nation so that that massive amount of material that we’re getting in is being delivered all over the country.\\n\\nTomorrow, we’ll deliver an additional 600,000 N95 masks to New York City to take care of the needs of the public hospital system.\\xa0 It was requested — Mayor de Blasio.\\xa0 We’ve been working great with Mayor de Blasio, getting him a lot of stuff.\\xa0 He’s working very hard; I can tell you that.\\xa0 And we’re working, really, very hard with New York City and with New York State.\\n\\nAnd at the request of Congressman Lee Zeldin, out in Long Island, we will also be delivering another 200,000 N95 masks to Suffolk County, where they need it very badly.\\xa0 So we’re getting that out on an emergency basis.\\xa0 It should be there tomorrow.\\n\\nWe’ll also be deploying millions of N95 masks to other locations that Admiral Polowczyk will detail shortly.\\xa0 The Admiral will be up in just a couple of minutes.\\n\\nOver the last 24 hours, FEMA has delivered an additional 500 ventilators to New Jersey.\\xa0 Five hundred.\\xa0 And again, the governor has been very thankful.\\xa0 We’re working very hard with New Jersey, including building hospitals.\\n\\nWe’ve also sent an additional 200 ventilators to Louisiana — a definite hotspot.\\xa0 Three hundred to Michigan — working very well, I think, with the governor.\\n\\nAmazingly, 600 will be going or have gone to Illinois.\\xa0 And, I mean, there’s a governor — I hear him complaining all the time — Pritzker.\\xa0 I hear him; he’s always complaining.\\xa0 And yet, I just said, “Give me a list of a couple of the things we’ve done in Illinois.”\\xa0 And we’re building a 2,500-bed hospital in McCormick Place; that’s the big convention center in Chicago.\\xa0 And we’re helping to staff it and probably will end up staffing it because he’s not able to do what you’re supposed to be able to do as a governor.\\xa0 He has not performed well.\\n\\nAnd we’re also sending 100 ventilators to Massachusetts.\\n\\nSo we have 600 to Illinois.\\xa0 We have 100 to Massachusetts.\\xa0 We have 300 to Michigan.\\xa0 We have 200 to Louisiana.\\xa0 We have 500 ventilators — 500 — going to New Jersey.\\xa0 And this is being done by FEMA.\\xa0 It’s being delivered by FEMA.\\xa0 And it’s — that’s some job.\\xa0 Just think of that.\\xa0 When you think about 500 ventilators, a ventilator is a big deal.\\n\\nWe’re also establishing a federal medical station in the Washington, D.C., area to help Washington, D.C., and working very closely with the mayor and everybody in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nAt the same time, Governor Inslee — we appreciate this — of Washington State has returned 400 ventilators, which can now be deployed elsewhere in our country.\\xa0 So the State of Washington has done very well.\\xa0 They won’t be needing some of the ventilators that have been sent — about 400.\\xa0 That’s a lot.\\xa0 And we appreciate that he’s able to give them back.\\xa0 He feels confident that they are in good shape for the coming weeks, until we can declare a final victory.\\n\\nIn the days ahead, America will endure the peak of this terrible pandemic.\\xa0 Our warriors in this life-and-death battle are the incredible doctors and nurses and healthcare workers on the frontline of the fight.\\xa0 We pledge to them our eternal gratitude and everlasting support.\\xa0 They make all of us very proud.\\xa0 Our country is very proud.\\xa0 We have people — they love our country.\\xa0 The world loves our country, most of it.\\xa0 Probably all of it; they just don’t say it.\\n\\nI can report today that the United States has now tested and given results — gotten results of 1.67 million people.\\xa0 That’s far more than any other country has been able to do.\\xa0 And you remember, we inherited a broken system.\\xa0 So a lot of this has been developed.\\n\\nBy Tuesday, 1,200 brand-new rapid point-of-care testing kits has been produced by Abbott Laboratories.\\xa0 A great company.\\xa0 And they’ll be distributed to all of our public health labs — that’s a 15-minute test; even less — as well as the Indian Health Service, the CDC, and the Strategic National Stockpile.\\n\\nSo we’re going to have 1,200.\\xa0 And on a weekly basis, we’re making a lot more.\\xa0 They go very fast.\\xa0 They’re very accurate tests.\\xa0 And other countries are wanting them.\\xa0 So, at the right time, we’ll be able to do that.\\xa0 But right now, we’re getting them to all of ours.\\n\\nSo we’ve done 1,670,000 tests.\\xa0 Think of that: 1,670,000 tests.\\xa0 And we have a great system now.\\xa0 We’re working with the states in almost all instances, but we have a great system.\\n\\nAnd the other thing that we bought a tremendous amount of is the hydroxychloroquine — hydroxychloroquine — which I think — as you know, it’s a great malaria drug.\\xa0 It’s worked unbelievably.\\xa0 It’s this powerful drug on malaria.\\xa0 And there are signs that it works on this.\\xa0 Some very strong signs.\\xa0 And, in the meantime, it’s been around a long time.\\xa0 It also works very powerfully on lupus.\\xa0 Lupus.\\n\\nSo there are some very strong, powerful signs, and we’ll have to see.\\xa0 Because again, it’s being tested now.\\xa0 This is a new thing that just happened to us — the “invisible enemy,” we call it.\\n\\nAnd, if you can, if you have a — no signs of heart problems, the azrithromycin [sic] — azithromycin — which will kill certain things that you don’t want living within your body — it’s powerful drug — if you don’t have a problem, a heart problem, we would say: Let your doctor think about it.\\xa0 But as a combination, I think they’re going to be — I think they’re two things that should be looked at very strongly.\\n\\nNow, we have purchased and we have stockpiled 29 million pills of the hydroxychloroquine — 29 million.\\xa0 A lot of drugstores have them by prescription, and also — and they’re not expensive.\\xa0 Also, we’re sending them to various labs, our military.\\xa0 We’re sending them to the hospitals.\\xa0 We’re sending them all over.\\n\\nI just think it’s something — you know the expression, I’ve used it for certain reasons: “What do you have to lose?”\\xa0 What do you have to lose?\\xa0 And a lot of people are saying that when — and are taking it — if you’re a doctor, a nurse, a first responder, a medical person going into hospitals, they say taking it before the fact is good.\\xa0 But what do you have to lose?\\xa0 They say, “Take it.”\\n\\nI’m not looking at it one way or the other, but we want to get out of this.\\xa0 If it does work, it would be a shame if we didn’t do it early.\\xa0 But we have some very good signs.\\xa0 So that’s hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.\\n\\nAnd, again, you have to go through your medical people, get the approval.\\xa0 But I’ve seen things that I sort of like.\\xa0 So what do I know?\\xa0 I’m not a doctor.\\xa0 I’m not a doctor.\\xa0 But I have common sense.\\xa0 The FDA feels good about it.\\xa0 They’ve — as you know, they’ve approved it.\\xa0 They gave it a rapid approval.\\xa0 And the reason: because it’s been out there for a long time and they know the side effects and they also know the potential.\\xa0 So, based on that, we have sent it throughout the country and we have it stockpiled — about 29 million doses.\\xa0 Twenty-nine million doses.\\xa0 We have a lot of it.\\xa0 We hope it works.\\n\\nDriven by the goal of the brightest minds in science — we have the brightest minds in science, but we’re driven by the goal of getting rid of this plague, getting rid of this scourge, getting rid of this virus.\\xa0 These brilliant minds are working on the most effective antiviral therapies and vaccines.\\xa0 We are working very, very hard.\\xa0 I have met many of the doctors that are doing it.\\xa0 These are doctors that are working so hard on vanquishing the virus.\\n\\nThey’re staying — we strongly recommend staying at home, practicing vigorous hygiene, and maintaining social distance, so you’re — you’re just not going to catch it.\\xa0 It’s the most effective weapon in this war.\\n\\nAnd I will tell you, the — we are committing to the — to you.\\xa0 We’re committing to the people of our country like few administrations, few people, few professionals have ever committed before.\\xa0 They are — they are working so hard.\\xa0 I see them.\\xa0 I see them before my eyes, exhausted — people that I’m dealing with every day, exhausted.\\xa0 They haven’t left their offices.\\xa0 They haven’t left their hospitals.\\xa0 We meet with them.\\xa0 We see them.\\n\\nAnd tremendous strides have been made.\\xa0 I think the vaccines — we’ll have a report on that.\\xa0 But the vaccines — we’re working together with other countries.\\xa0 We’re also working with other countries — many other countries.\\xa0 And we all want everyone else to be first.\\xa0 We’re very happy.\\xa0 But we are very far down the line on vaccines.\\xa0 We’ll see how that all works.\\xa0 Johnson & Johnson is doing a great job, working very hard.\\xa0 A vaccine would be great.\\xa0 Therapy — a therapy and therapeutics would be great.\\xa0 We’ll see what happens.\\xa0 In the meantime, you may listen to what I said about the two drugs mentioned.\\n\\nMy administration is rapidly implementing the largest emergency economic relief package in American history.\\xa0 You’ve seen what’s been happening.\\xa0 Billions of dollars in small- business loans have already been processed through Paycheck Protection Programs.\\n\\nSo we went out on Friday and, literally, it’s become so popular.\\xa0 It’s been worked with the banks.\\xa0 They get it to the small business.\\xa0 It’s all about employment.\\xa0 It’s all about jobs.\\xa0 We want you to keep your jobs.\\xa0 It gives small business funding to keep the workers on the payroll.\\xa0 And we’re sending direct cash payments to millions of Americans and rushing aid to the hardest-hit industries.\\xa0 We’re saving industries.\\xa0 We will be — you’ll be seeing it.\\xa0 And if we do more, we’re going to do more, and we’re going to try and get directly to people that are hit so hard.\\n\\nBut we’re going to take care of our workers.\\xa0 We’re going to take care of our citizens.\\xa0 We’re going to take care of our small businesses.\\xa0 We’re going to take care of our large businesses: the airplane industry, the — the airline industry.\\xa0 A lot of great industries that we have that are in trouble because of what took place over the last short period of time.\\n\\nThese are industries that were doing better — for the most part, doing better than ever.\\xa0 The airlines were doing great.\\xa0 Oil was doing great — oil and gas.\\xa0 And the energy industry was doing phenomenally well, and it got hit like nobody has ever been hit before.\\xa0 Just about like no industry has ever been hit before.\\xa0 There’s never been anything like this.\\n\\nBut we see light at the end of the tunnel.\\xa0 Things are happening.\\xa0 Things are happening.\\xa0 We’re starting to see light at the end of the tunnel.\\xa0 And hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, we’ll be very proud of the job we all did.\\xa0 We can never be happy when so many people are dying, but we’re going to be very proud of the job we did to keep the death down to an absolute minimum — the least it could have happened with this terrible, terrible virus.\\n\\nIn closing, I also want to note today is Palm Sunday and the beginning of Holy Week for Christians in America and all around the world.\\xa0 While we may be apart from one another, as you can see from our great churches, our great pastors and ministers are out there working very hard.\\xa0 But we may be apart — we can use this time to turn to reflection and prayer and our own personal relationship with God.\\n\\nI would ask that all Americans pray for the heroic doctors and nurses, for the truck drivers and grocery store workers, and for everyone fighting this battle.\\xa0 I had mentioned yesterday, where I see the nurses rushing into hospitals, and they’re putting on their outfits, and they’re putting on their masks and goggles, in some cases.\\xa0 They’re rushing into war.\\xa0 They’re rushing into war.\\n\\nAnd I see people from apartment houses screaming and shouting and singing their praises.\\xa0 It’s an incredible thing.\\xa0 They’re warriors — these doctors and nurses.\\xa0 They’re running into buildings, and they’re literally putting it on as the doors are opening.\\xa0 They’re putting all their stuff and running inside.\\xa0 And they’re running inside to tremendous danger.\\xa0 Tremendous danger.\\n\\nBut, most of all, I’d like to ask for your prayers for the families who have lost loved ones.\\xa0 Ask God to comfort them in their hour of grief.\\xa0 It’s a great hour of grief for our nation, for the world.\\n\\nThis morning — I was talking 151.\\xa0 For four days, I said 151.\\xa0 A hundred and fifty-one countries.\\xa0 This morning, it’s 182 countries.\\xa0 It jumped up a lot.\\xa0 So, as of this morning, it’s 182 countries are under attack from this monster.\\n\\nWith the faith of our families and the spirit of our people, and the grace of our God, we will endure, we will overcome, we will prevail.\\xa0 We have learned so much.\\xa0 We will be stronger than ever.\\n\\nAnd I just want to thank everybody.\\xa0 I want to thank the incredible professionals on the task force also.\\xa0 We had a big meeting today.\\xa0 We — were calls all day long to so many different people.\\xa0 And I think our package to get everyone working when we’re ready is really turning out to be successful.\\xa0 We may have to make it larger because it’s been really successful.\\xa0 But all of that comes back to this country.\\xa0 We want to get them back.\\xa0 We want to get our people back to work.\\xa0 Everybody wants to be back.\\xa0 We want to open up our country as soon as possible.\\n\\nSo, with that, I’m going to ask Dr. Birx to say a few words, and she’s got some charts to show you.\\xa0 And thank you very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 As you can see from the hopeful signs in Italy and Spain, where we see, finally, new cases and deaths declining, it’s giving us hope of what our future could be.\\n\\nWe wanted to give you an update on where all of the states were.\\xa0 We’re looking at this as states normalized per 100,000 citizens.\\xa0 It looks very similar to last week.\\xa0 We wanted to update you.\\xa0 We’ve been covering throughout the week the states that were moving on this map.\\n\\nYou can see very clearly where New York is as a state, although this is very much still centered in the New York metro area.\\xa0 New Jersey is the orange line.\\xa0 The green line is Louisiana.\\xa0 That’s followed by Massachusetts, and then Connecticut and Michigan are together in those lines towards the bottom.\\xa0 And then, of course, Washington, D.C., is now visible on this map, which was not visible before.\\xa0 And the yellow line towards the bottom is Washington State.\\n\\nNext slide, please.\\n\\nSo this just summarize all of the states we’re tracking very closely at the county level.\\xa0 So we’re tracing and tracking not only the epidemic at the state level, but understanding what’s happening in county by county with new cases and, of course, also the deaths.\\n\\nWe’re also triangulating that with all of the laboratory data.\\xa0 And just to tell you how we’re kind of doing that: For New York, which you can see at the top, their serology is now about 36 percent positive.\\xa0 They were in the 40s.\\xa0 So, day over day, their percent positive is finally starting to decline.\\xa0 New Jersey’s is increasing, however.\\xa0 They’re now up to 42 percent of the specimens that come to the laboratory are positive.\\xa0 Louisiana, 25 percent.\\xa0 Massachusetts, 20 percent.\\xa0 Connecticut and Michigan, 20 percent.\\xa0 District of Columbia, 15 percent.\\xa0 Washington, 8 percent.\\xa0 And then, Illinois and Colorado are at about 16 percent.\\xa0 Pennsylvania, which is also new to the graphic, is it about 12 percent.\\n\\nNext slide, please.\\n\\nSo, if we could go back one — I’m sorry.\\xa0 If you go back one slide.\\xa0 One more.\\xa0 All of the states here, those are 38 of the states.\\xa0 Thirty-eight of our states have less than 50 cases per hundred thousand.\\xa0 They are testing.\\xa0 Their laboratory results are consistent with that.\\xa0 Their seropositivity rate for their laboratories are less than 5 percent.\\n\\nSo this is how we’re tracking and triangulating both case reporting, mortality or fatalities, and also triangulating that with the laboratory.\\n\\nThe New York metro area, New Jersey, Louisiana, and a series — and Washington State — have all tested at a rate greater than Italy and Spain.\\xa0 I know many of you are tracking that. Remember, many of us, we pushed out a lot of those assays at the beginning, over the last two to three weeks.\\xa0 And I want to just thank Admiral Giroir and HHS, who’s been working very closely to make sure that the states that were having an outbreak had access to all of their assays.\\n\\nNext slide, please.\\xa0 And then next one.\\n\\nSo just to give you an idea of how we’re looking at this, we look at cases every day.\\xa0 I want to just thank my data team.\\xa0 They spend all evening compiling data.\\xa0 I get it about 2 o’clock in the morning.\\xa0 And it looks at all of these metro areas by their granular counties.\\xa0 So we can see the counties that have new cases.\\xa0 That also helps us identify the hospitals and understand what hospitals will need ventilators or PPE.\\n\\nSo, this is the Detroit area; it’s Oakland and Detroit. Wayne County.\\n\\nNext slide.\\n\\nWe also then — also track mortality.\\xa0 It gives us insight into how many clients are in the ICU and need care.\\xa0 And we want to make sure that we’re meeting the needs both on cases and really appreciating the frontline healthcare workers that are really saving many people’s lives.\\n\\nNext slide.\\n\\nThis just gives you an idea from New Orleans.\\xa0 We are now also tracking St. John the Baptist Parish also.\\xa0 But this was the New Orleans and Jefferson County, and really tracking those on a case-by-case basis to look for changes over time.\\xa0 And next slide is their mortality.\\xa0 And you can see it’s starting to stabilize.\\n\\nSo this is how we’ve been tracking and tracing the epidemic as it moves through states and counties and communities.\\xa0 But as we started, we just wanted to note again: We do see hopeful signs in Spain and Italy.\\xa0 They have completed nearly four weeks of mitigation with people really doing social distancing, staying at home, ensuring they were washing their hands.\\xa0 If they have to go out to the grocery store, they’re extraordinarily careful; they send one person from the family.\\n\\nAnd so we can really see that beginning to work, and we’re very hopeful that, over the next week — although we’ll see rising number of cases of people who lose their lives to this illness — we’re also hopeful to see a stabilization of cases across these large metro areas where the outbreak began several weeks ago.\\n\\nSo thank you for your attention.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Admiral?\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 What I thought I would do is update on the average first, and then follow up on Dr. Birx and how we’re geographically aligning the supply chain.\\n\\nSo the average: We had three additional flights come in today, bringing a million gowns, 2.8 million N95 masks, 2.8 million surgical masks, 11.8 million gloves, 18.6 thousand gowns on three flights.\\xa0 And that material will be pushed out across the nation, delivered to hospitals, nursing homes across the country.\\n\\nDr. Birx went through the geography.\\xa0 And so, over the last few days, I’ve been aligning the supply chain to those areas, and then reaching down into those areas and extracting data from those areas on PPE burn rates.\\n\\nSo, for example, I spent the weekend talking to the chief operating officer of Detroit, Hakim Berry, for example, and talked to the leadership at Detroit Medical Center, Audrey Gregory; talked to the health officer at Oakland County, Michigan; and then also with the Chicago health officer, Dr. Allison Arwady.\\xa0 So, reaching down to the — to a level to understand their needs.\\n\\nSo we’re geographically aligning the supply chain.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 So you can see Dr. Birx went through these counties, and we’re getting down to the county level.\\xa0 And then aligning it by priorities of point of care: public hospitals, first, VA hospitals, private hospitals, nursing homes, first responders, acute care.\\n\\nOver the coming days, we will be making a push to the geographic areas that Dr. Birx mentioned — increasing the volume through the supply chain to those areas to give them weeks, not just days’ worth of supply — primarily using our industry partners that we are directing: Cardinal, McKesson, Medline, Owen & Minor, Henry Schein, Concordance Healthcare — directing them to put product to the hospital door, the nursing home door, the first responders, directly to them.\\n\\nWe’re also working to push out millions of doses of hydrochlor- —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Hydroxy.\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 Hydroxychlorine [sic].\\xa0 Right.\\n\\nWe are working the distribution there to push the same thing to the same impacted areas, working to get it into hospitals and to every pharmacy.\\n\\nAnd so my team is back there right now working the arrangements to make — make that to the hospital front door and primarily to the local pharmacies so a doctor can write those prescriptions and you can get it prior to having to go to a hospital.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Great job.\\xa0 Thank you very much, Admiral.\\xa0 Mike, please.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Robert Wilkie, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, good.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I know you didn’t see him.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good.\\n\\nSECRETARY WILKIE:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 My last appearance here, I mentioned that the President had given the Department of Veterans Affairs very specific instructions to be as aggressive as possible in response to the virus crisis, not only to protect veterans but also to help the American people.\\n\\nAs many of you know, we have three primary missions at VA: One is to support veterans health.\\xa0 The other is to provide veterans with benefits.\\xa0 And the third is memorial services.\\xa0 But we have a fourth mission, and that is to support the nation in times of national emergency, both in war and in peace.\\n\\nWe provide a bridge from the federal government to the states and localities during these emergencies.\\xa0 As a result of that, I have ordered our veterans hospitals to begin preparing more than 1,500 beds to make them available both at the ICU and the acute-care level to the states and localities across the country.\\xa0 As a result of that, we have opened up approximately 100 beds in the metropolitan New York area, in Brooklyn, and in Manhattan, and East Orange, New Jersey.\\n\\nWe will be informing the governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, tomorrow, that we will give him access to our VA Medical Center in Shreveport, Louisiana, to come to the aid of the people of the Pelican State.\\n\\nI’ve also given instructions to initiate the fourth mission in Michigan.\\xa0 We will be providing the people of Michigan access to hospital beds in both Ann Arbor and in Detroit.\\xa0 We’ve also provided a pharmaceutical trailer to be used by the governor of Michigan, at Cobo Hall, to support the citizens of Michigan who will be coming into that facility for medical care.\\n\\nWe have also informed the state — the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that we will be helping them in their efforts to protect their most vulnerable citizens in two of their nursing homes.\\n\\nSo, in accord with the President’s instructions, the 400,000 men and women of the Department of Veterans Affairs are in this fight.\\xa0 We are in the fight not only for the nine and a half million veterans who are part of our service, but we are in the fight for the people of the United States.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\\n\\nSECRETARY WILKIE:\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nMike?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 And you all have just heard from several members of the President’s White House Coronavirus Task Force, and we are — we are truly blessed to have the kind of leadership that we have.\\n\\nAnd whether it be Admiral Polowczyk, who is organizing the distribution of tens of millions of supplies; whether it be Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci, who are analyzing the data literally hour by hour; or whether it be that whole-of-government approach that you stood up, Mr. President, calling on every agency of government, including the VA, HHS, and every agency — I hope the American people know, at this President’s direction, we are — we are sparing no expense.\\xa0 We are doing whatever it takes.\\xa0 We’re marshaling the full resources of the federal government to respond to the challenges facing communities impacted today by the coronavirus and making sure every community in America has the support.\\n\\nWe’ve also — as the President has said so many times, we forged a seamless partnership with states around the country.\\xa0 As the President just reflected, by this Tuesday, with another 840 military medical personnel arriving in New York City, there will be some 3,000 Department of Defense and HHS personnel on the ground to supplement and to provide relief to healthcare workers, really, at the epicenter of the coronavirus in the New York City area.\\xa0 And you just heard the VA is opening up — opening up bed space.\\n\\nIn New Jersey, I spoke, at the President’s urging today, with Governor Murphy.\\xa0 Five hundred ventilators, announced today, being built on the supplies that we have already provided.\\xa0 We were able to coordinate with him to extent all federal coordination on testing in New Jersey through May the 30th, if the need is there, and also opening up VA beds.\\n\\nI spoke with Governor John Bel Edwards in Louisiana and was encouraged to hear from him that, as you heard Dr. Birx say, that new cases were down slightly.\\xa0 In fact, we’re seeing a trend of some leveling among all the governors I spoke to today.\\xa0 And I know what the Secretary of the VA just announced — about opening up VA facilities — has been a priority for Governor Edwards, but I assured him we’re going to continue to send resources and supplies and personnel to support their healthcare.\\n\\nIn Michigan today, I spoke to both the governor, Gretchen Whitmer; and Mayor Mike Duggan of the city of Detroit.\\xa0 Governor Whitmer and I spoke about a new program in Detroit that will make hydrochloroquine available for 3,000 patients through the Henry Ford Hospital.\\xa0 They’ll be tracking, in a formal study, the results of that.\\n\\nBut at the President’s urging, I assured her that we’re more than prepared to make hydrochloroquine broadly available to pharmacies and doctors’ offices across the Detroit area as they deem appropriate.\\n\\nI also heard from Mayor Mike Duggan, as I told you, Mr. President.\\xa0 And he was so grateful to the FDA, not only for approving the Henry Ford Hospital tests that will be exploring hydrochloroquine, but also for the rapid approval of the 15- minute test.\\xa0 In fact, Mayor Duggan told me that he was able to use the 15-minute test this weekend to test 150 first responders who had been sidelined because they’d been exposed to the coronavirus.\\xa0 They all got the 15-minute tests.\\xa0 They’re all back in the line of duty.\\xa0 And the mayor couldn’t have been more grateful.\\n\\nIn Illinois, I spoke with Governor J.B. Pritzker, as well as Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago.\\xa0 As you just heard, not only have we sent 600 ventilators to the State of Illinois, but I assured — I assured the governor, I assured the mayor that while the principal focus that we have in the next several days is on the rising cases in the Greater New York City area and Louisiana, that Michigan and Illinois are in the forefront of our thinking.\\xa0 And at the President’s direction, we’re going to make sure the people of Illinois and the people of Michigan have the resources, equipment, and support that they need.\\n\\nThe governor did express great appreciation for the fact that our Army Corps of Engineers had constructed 500 beds at McCormick Place, and before the end of this week would construct another 2,500 beds for an overflow healthcare facility in Chicago.\\n\\nIn fact, Mr. President, Mayor Lightfoot told me that the Army Corps was just outstanding in the job that they have been doing in constructing that extra bed space.\\n\\nAs I close, let me just — let me just express, as the President did, our profound appreciation for Governor Kate Brown and Governor Jay Inslee.\\xa0 The State of Oregon and the State of Washington are leading by example.\\xa0 Oregon sent 140 ventilators to New York City.\\xa0 They looked at their circumstances and concluded that they could spare those at the point of the need. And because of the low and steady numbers in Washington State and in California, Governor Inslee today announced that they were sending 400 ventilators back to the Strategic National Stockpile.\\xa0 And those will be deployed at the point of the need.\\n\\nYou know, not only are California and Washington State low and steady but, frankly, as I talked to governors and mayors today, I want to say to the American people that we — we are beginning to see the glimmers of progress.\\xa0 The experts will tell me not to jump to any conclusions, and I’m not.\\xa0 But like your President, I’m an optimistic person and I’m hopeful.\\n\\nAnd the truth is, we’re starting to see cases and, most importantly, losses and hospitalizations begin to stabilize.\\xa0 But make no mistake about it: I want to say to the American people, if that holds, if that’s happening, it’s because of what all of you are doing.\\xa0 It’s because the American people are putting into practice the coronavirus guidelines for America.\\xa0 You’re listening to your state and local officials.\\xa0 You’re practicing social distancing.\\xa0 You’re using drive-throughs instead of going into restaurants.\\n\\nAnd so on behalf of your President and all of us who are working, really, at every level, I just want to say: Thank you, America.\\xa0 Thank you for responding.\\xa0 Thank you for putting other people’s lives in the forefront of your thinking, and putting it, again, over and above your own inconvenience and difficulty.\\n\\nBecause of your efforts, there is, as the President just said, light at the end of the tunnel.\\xa0 And I’m absolutely convinced: With the continued cooperation, patience, persistence, and prayers of the American people, we’ll get through this, and we’ll get through this a lot sooner than we first thought it would take.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mike, very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, if I could start with the Admiral, if that’s all right with you, sir.\\xa0 I wanted to ask you about the air gap flights, sir.\\xa0 There were the two flights that came through — or the three flights.\\xa0 Where did they come from, sir?\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 They came from Asia.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Asia.\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 And then, you were mentioning all these supplies being dropped off — the masks, the gowns, the hydrochloroquine.\\xa0 How are you guys making sure that there’s not a run on these products?\\xa0 You know, you drop them off at hospital A and that people just don’t rush and go grab every mask, gown?\\n\\nAnd then a question for you, sir, after that.\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 So, it’s going to the loading dock, and there’s an invoice.\\xa0 And so those people that are responsible for that loading dock and that invoice, they’re going to make sure that there’s not going to be a run on the bank.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You’re not worried about a run on any of these supplies?\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 No.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 I appreciate it.\\n\\nMr. President, first, did you have a chance —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They do get orders for a lot more than sometimes we think an area needs.\\xa0 Generally speaking, we like to either negotiate that down or give it to them as they want.\\n\\nSo we’ve had a lot of orders that we think are high, but we generally like, if we have it — if we have, for instance, with the medicines and with other things, we like to give it to them.\\n\\nEvery day, we’re building up and building it up very rapidly, and deploying it.\\xa0 But we do get orders from some of the states where we don’t think they need it.\\xa0 We try and get it for them what they want anyway.\\n\\nOkay?\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And you mentioned the Prime Minister off the top.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Any chance to speak to him today, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I didn’t speak to him, no.\\xa0 I did get a call from the ambassador.\\xa0 And, hey, it’s a big — it’s a big move, going to the hospital.\\xa0 That’s a big thing.\\n\\nHe’s a great gentleman, so I — you know, I just hope he’s okay.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And then also, you mentioned the nurses, the doctors, the people that you see celebrating.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sorry, the people that are gearing up and getting ready — the people that are applauding and celebrating them.\\n\\nHas there been any talk on any level whatsoever of some sort of either compensation fund or protection for nurses, doctors?\\xa0 Because there’s been a lot of fear.\\xa0 There’s been some people that said, “I can’t risk my family’s livelihood.\\xa0 I can’t go back to the ER.”\\xa0 Has there been any discussion —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re talking about it, and we’re talking about doing something for them.\\xa0 But we’re really looking at the conclusion.\\xa0 We want to just — we don’t want to focus on that now.\\xa0 They’re incredible.\\xa0 There’s — they’re not saying, “We’re not doing it.”\\xa0 They go in with good equipment, with great equipment, and with stuff that’s not so good.\\xa0 And sometimes they catch it wearing the best stuff you can buy — brand new, the best stuff.\\n\\nThis is a very tough enemy.\\xa0 But these are amazing people.\\xa0 No, we are talking about something, but we’re really thinking about, let’s get it finished first before we do that.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, the Surgeon General, this morning, was talking about the coming week being among the hardest and saddest weeks of our lives.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 A tough — tough week.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 He was talking about this being our Pearl Harbor, our 9/11 moment.\\xa0 You all are talking about glimmers of hope and stabilization.\\xa0 How are the American people supposed to bridge those different descriptions that they’re getting from this administration?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t think they’re so different.\\xa0 I think we all know that we have to reach a certain point, and that point is going to be a horrific point in terms of death.\\xa0 But it’s also a point at which things are going to start changing.\\n\\nWe’re getting very close to that level right now.\\xa0 And the next week and a half, two weeks are going to be — I think they’re going to be very difficult.\\n\\nAt the same time, we understand what they represent and what that time represents, and hopefully we can get this over with because this is a very horrible thing for the world.\\xa0 Hey, look, we’re one country out of 182 now that have — 182 countries.\\n\\nI have a friend of mine — said he didn’t know we had so many countries in the world.\\xa0 A hundred and eighty-two countries are now affected by this.\\xa0 So we want to get it over with.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And with those numbers, sir — could I just ask one follow-up —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — on those numbers that you were talking about earlier?\\xa0 How does that change the projections that you were making earlier this week of 100,000 to 240,000 deaths?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we hope we can stay under those numbers.\\xa0 Those are numbers of death.\\xa0 And we hope we can stay under those numbers.\\xa0 That would be terrific.\\xa0 And as far under those numbers as possible.\\n\\nNow, if we did nothing, you know that number too.\\xa0 But the American people really stepped up; so did the professionals.\\xa0 They just really stepped up.\\xa0 So we’re hoping to stay under those numbers.\\n\\nAnd that means the minimum and the maximum, but we’re hoping to stay under the minimum number.\\xa0 You know what that number was.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 But do the numbers that you were talking about today, have they changed those projections?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I would say the answer is “yes,” but I would also say that we’re not going to know really in terms of a final toll until we get out to the end.\\xa0 And we’re probably, possibly, not so far away.\\xa0 We’re getting closer.\\xa0 But it’s our goal to stay as far under that minimum number — the minimum number as possible.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 That’s what we want to do.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, as President of the United States, your words carry enormous weight in this country and around the world.\\xa0 And while you acknowledge you’re not a physician, you do promote these medicines extensively here.\\xa0 How do you not go so far as to be giving medical advice?\\xa0 And you said, yesterday, you might take some of these medicines, even though you don’t have symptoms. \\xa0Are you still planning to do that?\\xa0 And how do you calibrate being enthusiastic —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and not playing doctor?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Because I want people to live and I’m seeing people dying.\\xa0 And I see people that are going to die without it.\\xa0 And you know the expression.\\xa0 When that’s happening, they should do it.\\xa0 What really do we have to lose?\\n\\nWe also have — this medicine has been tested for many years for malaria and for lupus, so it’s been out there.\\xa0 So it’s a very strong, powerful medicine, but it doesn’t kill people.\\xa0 We have some very good results and some very good tests.\\xa0 You’ve seen the same test that I have.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But for those without symptoms, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 In France, they had a very good test; they’re continuing.\\xa0 But we don’t have time to go and say, “Gee, let’s take a couple of years and test it out.\\xa0 And let’s go and test with the test tubes and the laboratories.”\\xa0 We don’t have time.\\xa0 I’d love to do that.\\xa0 But we have people dying today.\\xa0 As we speak, there are people dying.\\xa0 If it works, that would be great.\\xa0 If it doesn’t work — we know, for many years, malaria, it — it’s incredible what it’s done for malaria; it’s incredible what it’s done for lupus.\\xa0 But it doesn’t kill people.\\n\\nThat’s one of the things with a vaccine.\\xa0 When we have a vaccine, we have to do tests because when you inject that vaccine, when they take whatever ever it is they have to take, we have to make sure it doesn’t have a horrible impact, destroy somebody.\\xa0 Good?\\xa0 So we have to test it for a long period of time.\\xa0 This one, not so much because it’s been out there.\\n\\nNow, I’m not acting as a doctor.\\xa0 I’m saying, “Do what you want, but there are some good signs.”\\xa0 You’ve read the signs, I’ve read the signs.\\xa0 With the other one, there’s some very good signs also.\\xa0 Different — going together works very well.\\xa0 But there may be an indication that if you have a problem with your heart, you shouldn’t take what we call the Z-Pak.\\xa0 You shouldn’t take it, and that’s okay.\\n\\nBut I would love to go to a laboratory and spend a couple of years testing something.\\xa0 We don’t have time.\\xa0 We don’t have two hours, because there are people dying right now.\\xa0 If it does help, great.\\xa0 If it doesn’t help, we gave it a shot.\\xa0 We gave it a shot.\\xa0 That’s the way I feel.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Were you serious about taking it, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You know, we passed something — yeah, I would — I would be very serious about taking it.\\n\\nWe passed something that I’m very proud of.\\xa0 It’s called Right to Try.\\xa0 For 45, 50 years, they’ve been trying.\\xa0 It makes so much sense.\\xa0 We have the greatest doctors and labs and lab technicians, the greatest medicines, the greatest minds in the world.\\xa0 Everybody admits it.\\xa0 And when we’re close to having something, or when we have something that tests incredibly well, you couldn’t use it for years because they would take years and years to test.\\n\\nSo with the help of also Democrats — I got it bipartisan, but they’ve been trying to get this passed for — for decades. You know that.\\xa0 It’s called Right to Try.\\xa0 So a person would be diagnosed terminally ill from something.\\xa0 And in the old days, meaning before a year ago, they would say, “Do you think I could try this — this pill, this whatever, this medicine that’s testing so well?”\\xa0 “No, you can’t do that.\\xa0 You can’t do that under no circumstances.”\\xa0 They’d leave for Asia, they’d leave for Europe, they’d leave for — if they had money.\\xa0 If they had no money, they’d go home and die with no hope.\\n\\nWe got a thing called Right to Try.\\xa0 If somebody is very ill, terminally ill, they’re going to die.\\xa0 They — and it was very complex.\\xa0 It wasn’t as easy as it sounds because there were huge liability problems.\\xa0 The drug companies didn’t want to do it because they didn’t want it on test results — because these are very sick people, so they didn’t want to bring down their test results.\\xa0 The insurance companies had tremendous problems.\\n\\nI got everybody in the room, I said, “Look, we’ll sign a waiver.”\\xa0 The person taking it will say, “We’re not going to sue.”\\xa0 The family is not going to sue the drug company, not going to sue the insurance company, not going to sue the state, the city, or the federal government.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 It’s called “exculpation.”\\xa0 And we got it done.\\xa0 It’s a very simple agreement.\\xa0 I don’t know why nobody ever thought of it, but they never thought of it.\\xa0 I did.\\xa0 And we got it done.\\n\\nNow we have Right to Try, which is actually, in my opinion, much more difficult than what we’re talking about here.\\xa0 But if there’s a medicine or something, a possible cure, or something that’s looking good and somebody has something that’s going — they’re going to die or they’re very sick, they take it.\\xa0 And, you know, we’ve had some unbelievable results.\\xa0 Unbelievable results.\\xa0 And it also gives the people hope.\\n\\nYes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, but the doctors who are treating coronavirus patients, they have the medical expertise to determine whether or not they should prescribe hydroxychloroquine.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s true.\\xa0 And many of them do.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And there are already clinical trials in place —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — looking at hydroxychloroquine.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, why not —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They should be finished in about a year.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Why not just let the science speak for itself?\\xa0 Why are you promoting this drug?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m not.\\xa0 I’m not.\\xa0 I’m just saying —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You’re coming out —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — very simply.\\xa0 I’m not at all.\\xa0 I’m not.\\n\\nLook, you know what I’m trying to do?\\xa0 I’m trying to save lives.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, you come out here every day — right, sir? — talking about the benefits of hydroxychloroquine.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I want them to try it.\\xa0 And it may work, and it may not work.\\xa0 But if it doesn’t work, it’s nothing lost by doing it.\\xa0 Nothing.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What do you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Because we know — long term, what I want, I want to save lives.\\xa0 And I don’t want it to be in a lab for the next year and a half as people are dying all over the place.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But it’s already out there.\\xa0 Doctors are already able to prescribe it off label.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 So what do you accomplish?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 All I’m doing is saying — well, I’ll tell you what I accomplish.\\xa0 We bought massive amounts of it — 29 million doses of it.\\xa0 We have it coming from all of the labs.\\xa0 We’re actually now doing it here, because in case it does work, we want to have it.\\xa0 And we’ve given it to drugstores, we’re — we’re sending it all over.\\xa0 FEMA is doing it.\\xa0 FEMA is doing it.\\xa0 We’re doing it through different channels, many different channels, including the companies that make it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s a very special thing.\\xa0 Now, it may not work, in which case, hey, it didn’t work.\\xa0 And it may work, in which case, it’s going to save a lot of lives.\\xa0 Now, a lot of people say, if the people walking in prior to getting it, if they take it, it has a profound effect.\\xa0 Well, maybe it does and maybe it doesn’t.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Where is the conclusive medical evidence of that, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t want to wait a year and a half to find out.\\n\\nAnd only CNN would ask that question.\\xa0 Fake news.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, I have one for you on oil —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 A bunch of fakers.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — but, first, I was hoping to ask Dr. Birx a question.\\xa0 The President just said that — based on the most recent data, that you’ve seen some change in the projection.\\xa0 I’m wondering if you could — you obviously have a week’s more worth of data since the, sort of, 100,000 to 240,000 potential death figures that you gave us last week.\\n\\nSo I’m wondering, with all the caveats that this is, sort of, based on — continuing social distancing — that we might see — you know, if one city pops, things could change dramatically.\\xa0 What — what are the, sort of, range that you’re now looking at in terms of total death impact?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 I think the most important thing right now is when we were talking about why we are hopeful.\\xa0 We’re hopeful because last time I was here, I wasn’t able to really tell you that Italy and Spain were coming across their apex and coming down the other side.\\xa0 And I think, to me, that’s extraordinarily hopeful.\\xa0 They just completed four weeks of really strong mitigation.\\xa0 And I think that’s our word to the American people, is we can look like that.\\xa0 Two other countries look like that now — two other countries with a very similar experience to our experience, with higher case numbers and higher mortality.\\n\\nSo that’s what the promise is.\\xa0 The promise is: If we do this, we could potentially be better.\\xa0 Now, Dr. Fauci and I today got another update from another independent modeler, and the numbers came in close to that hundred thousand number.\\n\\nAgain, but we believe — Dr. Fauci and I — that if every American follows the guidelines — six feet, washing hands, not social gathering — that will have an even greater impact.\\xa0 And the other side of the equation certainly is our remarkable healthcare providers, our respiratory therapists, our laboratory technicians, our nurses and doctors.\\xa0 They’re saving lives every day.\\xa0 And so that changes the number too.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I also think that Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx are very impressed with the American people.\\xa0 And I’m not going to put words in anybody’s mouth — I would never do that — but I am, and I will say that they are doing maybe a better job than we all thought even possible.\\n\\nWhen you look at streets in New York where there’s nobody in the street, no cars, no nothing — I see it.\\xa0 You know, I’ve seen those streets for a long time and they’re packed all the time.\\xa0 And now you see there’s nobody.\\xa0 You look at other places; you look at what’s going on in California where they’re doing a fantastic job.\\xa0 They really are.\\xa0 The governor is doing great.\\xa0 I’m proud of them.\\xa0 I’m proud of a lot of people — proud of a lot of people on the other side.\\xa0 You know, of a lot of people.\\n\\nReally — I’m really delighted to work with people that, frankly, on other issues, I didn’t get along so well with.\\xa0 We disagree on this or that; we don’t have to go into that now.\\xa0 But we’re getting along with a lot of people.\\xa0 And they’re happy with us.\\xa0 We’re happy with them.\\n\\nBut I really believe that the American people are doing a better job than anybody would have thought even possible, and that’s one of the reasons we can even be talking about the kind of number that we hopefully will be talking about, which is at the minimum level instead of the maximum or beyond.\\xa0 It’s not even the maximum — it’s much beyond a maximum level, which would be horrific.\\n\\nYes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Oh, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr.\\xa0 President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Secretary Esper mentioned the Department of Defense might be moving in the direction of using face coverings.\\xa0 Former Vice President Biden had mentioned that he was going to be using a mask whenever he goes out now.\\xa0 Are we getting to a point where we might see members of the Coronavirus Task Force also wear face coverings?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it was voluntary, as I saw it yesterday.\\xa0 And certainly, if they’d want to, I would — I would encourage it.\\xa0 I would have absolutely no problem with that if they wanted.\\n\\nWe had a long meeting today.\\xa0 There’s good separation.\\xa0 But the task force meets and I would certainly have absolutely no problem if they wanted to.\\xa0 I think, frankly, it’s something, at least for a period of time, where it might be advisable.\\xa0 And you know, it’s advisory.\\xa0 And we’ll see what happens.\\n\\nYes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr.\\xa0 President.\\xa0 On Project Air Bridge, we’ve seen reports that Chinese shipments, testing kits, and PPE have turned out to be faulty to some capacity.\\xa0 We obviously don’t have overstock.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Not here.\\xa0 No, not here.\\xa0 No, no, no —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No, but to Spain, in particular.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, no, you’ve seen in Spain and you’ve seen in different — they’re not sending faulty things to us.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So we’re not concerned that any of the PPE we’re importing is defective?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, we test it.\\xa0 We look at it.\\xa0 We check it out.\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 (Inaudible.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 One of the things we’re doing to prevent that is using those six companies that are the ones in the major supply chain.\\xa0 We’re actually going to facilities, looking at product, inspecting it, and clearing it before it comes here.\\xa0 So you’ve — we’ve heard those things.\\xa0 That’s why — that’s why we’re doing that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 A follow-up for the doctors if possible\\xa0—\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And we’re also sending it to other — from other locations.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Right.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0 And when it comes to the ventilators, which are very complex, we are now building — we have now, under construction, literally thousands of ventilators.\\xa0 So — but so far, I think our projections on ventilators have been right.\\xa0 They’ve been correct.\\n\\nDid you have something?\\xa0 For who?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, for yourself and for Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci if they want to take a crack at it.\\xa0 Some of the models that you guys were using — the IHME model, in particular, has been very accurate when it comes to projecting deaths over the last couple of days.\\xa0 But there’s a couple of other metrics that they seem to be pretty far off on — specifically hospital beds.\\xa0 Are you guys, you know, happy with the models you’re currently using?\\xa0 Is there any need to adjust those?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it’s turning out that we need less hospital beds.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Right, but —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s what you’re talking about.\\xa0 And that’s what we — well, we may have models, but we’ve been sort of saying that.\\xa0 In New York, we were saying we think you’re going to need less.\\xa0 Now, let’s hope that continues.\\xa0 But right now — I heard Governor Cuomo this morning, and he was saying less hospital beds, also less death.\\xa0 That was a very big thing.\\nFirst time — less death today than yesterday, right?\\xa0 That’s a big thing.\\xa0 But also less hospital beds.\\xa0 That means less patients because basically it’s less patients.\\xa0 And we were saying that.\\xa0 And it also means less ventilators.\\xa0 So there’s a lot of — a lot of very positive things happening.\\n\\nOkay.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 With Prime Minister Johnson hospitalized —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — I noticed a few minutes ago you were standing right next to Vice President Pence.\\xa0 Are you considering staying away from each other just to make sure we have continuity of government in the executive branch?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We have — we have this tiny platform and I’d love it to be wider.\\xa0 You’re staying away from each other.\\n\\nMike, you were tested?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Like recently.\\xa0 So was I, a couple of days ago.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But what I mean: You keep interacting with groups of people —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We are.\\xa0 We are.\\xa0 We are. \\xa0You know, here we are on this platform.\\xa0 And — but I get next to him, I don’t breathe.\\xa0 I’m only kidding.\\xa0 We are — we are sometimes forced into positions that I’d rather — I’d rather be away, but it’s — you know, you’re all looking for questions.\\xa0 Mike is a very big part of this; I am.\\xa0 It’s very difficult maintaining like, this distance on this little area.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I just wanted to ask really quickly, under what circumstances you would consider leveling imports — tariffs on imports of oil to the United States.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, if the oil price stays the way it is because of people that really want to see it go up — when I say get — we want to save a great industry.\\xa0 We built a great industry in this country.\\xa0 If they don’t get along, I would do that.\\xa0 Yeah, I would do tariffs, very substantial tariffs.\\xa0 Because we’re independent now; we have our own oil.\\n\\nAnd if I did the tariffs, we essentially would be saying,\\n“We don’t want foreign oil.\\xa0 We don’t want any foreign oil.\\xa0 We’re just going to use our oil.”\\xa0 And that would help to save an industry.\\xa0 And, you know, it’s become a tremendous job producer.\\xa0 And it’s great to be independent.\\xa0 We’re independent.\\xa0 Our energy is now independent.\\xa0 We produce more oil than — oil and gas than anybody else, than any other country.\\xa0 And that all took place over the very recent time.\\n\\nNow, in the meantime, I’m seeing 91 dollars — 91 cents a gallon out on the road.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 A lot of people are happy.\\xa0 I see very inexpensive jet fuel.\\xa0 We’re trying to save the airline industry.\\xa0 But I want to save our great energy industry and that’s what we’re doing.\\n\\nYeah.\\xa0 So I would — I would absolutely do that.\\xa0 And what we’ll do — the price will still be very low — but what we’ll do is we’ll save — and, very importantly, we’ll save tens of thousands of jobs.\\n\\nOne of the other things we’re doing is having oil shipped to our strategic oil reserves.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 And, you know, we’re buying it for the right price and we’re shipping it.\\xa0 In some cases, we’re storing it for nothing.\\xa0 They’re there.\\xa0 We’re filling up our reserves with this very inexpensive oil.\\xa0 Nobody thought they’d ever see a price — this is like from the 1950s, where they had big dollars, okay?\\n\\nSo, no, I would use tariffs if I had to.\\xa0 I don’t think I’m going to have to because Russia doesn’t benefit by having this and Saudi Arabia doesn’t benefit by having it.\\xa0 They — you know, oil and gas are their major sources of income.\\xa0 So it’s obviously very bad for them.\\n\\nBut we have to — we have an industry that’s a very important industry and it’s really formed beautifully.\\xa0 It was the virus that killed it because what happened is it’s down 40 percent from the day this happened — 40 percent.\\xa0\\xa0 Otherwise, it would be doing phenomenally well.\\xa0 So that’s it.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, can we get an idea of a timeline for those people that are waiting for the stimulus checks — how many more days they may have to wait?\\n\\nAnd then, Speaker Pelosi, today — or I think last night said, in the next bill, that they would like to see additional stimulus checks made.\\xa0 Have you guys thrown around an amount of how much money —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, but I like the concept of it.\\xa0 I think it’s good.\\xa0 We’re talking about a different way of doing it, but I like the concept.\\n\\nI like the concept of infrastructure.\\xa0 Our country has to be rebuilt.\\xa0 They spent all this money in the Middle East — $8 trillion.\\xa0 We’re up to now $8 trillion in the Middle East.\\xa0 We got to rebuild our country.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 We have to rebuild our roads, and our schools, our bridges.\\xa0 We have to rebuild our country.\\xa0 So, I like an infrastructure bill.\\n\\nI also like money going directly to people.\\xa0 It’s not their fault that this happened.\\n\\nAnd I do think this — especially the faster we can get it open, our country — can you believe we’re talking about our country, getting our country open?\\xa0 The faster we get it open, the bigger the boom, the bigger the rocket ship going up.\\xa0 I think it has a chance to go really quickly, relatively quickly.\\xa0 I’d like to see very quickly, but we’ll see.\\n\\nBut part of the stimulus and part of what we’re doing, that will help it.\\xa0 And the nice part is we’re paying practically zero interest rates.\\xa0 You know we’re paying very little.\\xa0 It’s one of the reasons I like the infrastructure bill, because we’re borrowing — we have a strong dollar.\\xa0 And the advantage to a strong dollar is everybody wants to invest in this country.\\xa0 They all want to buy our dollar.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On the direct payments, sir: Just in terms of timeline, are we talking still two weeks?\\xa0 Are we talking ten days?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think so.\\xa0 Yeah, from what I’m hearing that’s —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Two weeks.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Two weeks?\\xa0 Okay, two weeks.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, a couple of weeks.\\xa0 That’s what I’m hearing.\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 I wanted to follow up on the hydroxy question.\\xa0 Thanks for the numbers.\\xa0 Has there been any tension with the medical staff on that?\\xa0 Are they in agreement with all these numbers?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, we — we discussed it with the staff.\\xa0 We discussed it with FDA.\\xa0 Well, the FDA approved it.\\xa0 So, you know — which is another point.\\xa0 I mean it’s been approved by FDA, which is very important.\\xa0 If it wasn’t approved by FDA, then I couldn’t do this.\\xa0 But FDA has approved it, the hydroxy.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And also, if this turns out not to work, are hospitals and doctors going to be exculpatory from the federal government under the Right to Try?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’ll see if it works.\\xa0 No, it’s not going to — it’s not going to hurt people.\\xa0 It can help them, but it’s not going to hurt them.\\xa0 That’s the beauty of it, you see.\\xa0 It can help them, but it’s not going to hurt them.\\xa0 What do you have to lose?\\n\\nOkay, a question?\\xa0 Yeah, in the back, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, you know, obviously we know anyone can spread the disease, right?\\xa0 Unwittingly.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So why even have a few businesses open?\\xa0 Why not just shut everything down?\\xa0 There are grocery stores that are open, fast food places.\\xa0 Why even take a little chance?\\xa0 Just shutter them all down for — temporarily.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re going to have to — we’ll answer that question later.\\xa0 All I can say is that right now things are looking now things are looking really good and opening up with a bang will be a great thing.\\xa0 And there’s nobody going to be happier than me.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just to follow up on your comments about the ventilators —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — the IHME model suggests that 32,000 ventilators will be required by the peak in mid-April.\\xa0 GM is not expected to have ventilators ready before —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thirty-two thousand will be what?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Required across the country.\\xa0 GM -–\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 In addition to the ones that we’ve already sent?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just in — in general.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Don’t forget, we have almost 10,000 — a little more 9,000 right now.\\xa0 And those are ready to rock should we need them.\\n\\nAnd we had to keep it.\\xa0 You understand that: flexibility.\\xa0 So that if we need them in New York — which we might not — if we need them.\\xa0 But they’re ready to move.\\xa0 We have — we’re all ready.\\xa0 Military — it’s a military operation.\\xa0 We are ready to move.\\xa0 They’ll be moved immediately into whatever section of the country we need.\\n\\nWould you like to answer that by the way?\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCYZK:\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\xa0 So, correct.\\xa0 FEMA is working on plan to be able to move ventilators.\\xa0 So, for example, if DOD gave another 500 ventilators, they’re on the move to being staged at Fort Dix, to be able to rapidly deploy them to locations.\\xa0 And to include — you know, you heard the President mentioned states giving to states, things like that.\\xa0 So there’s — there’s the ventilators that aren’t in use that conceivably we could rapidly move as well.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Right, but you mentioned that there were thousands that are currently being made.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So I just wondered if there was any update with GM and Ford just because they —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, but they’re not going to be long.\\xa0 They’ve started.\\xa0 GM, Ford, we have many — we have 11 companies — approximately 11 companies — building them.\\xa0 And we’re going to have a stockpile for future — hopefully, we never have to use them.\\xa0 They should have — the hospitals, the states should have bought a stockpile.\\xa0 They didn’t do that.\\xa0 So we’ve made up for it.\\n\\nBut if we have extras — other countries need them.\\xa0 I mean, you see UK needs them badly, France needs a badly, Italy needs them badly.\\xa0 They need them.\\xa0 So, it’s complicated.\\xa0 It’s a big piece of equipment.\\xa0 It’s expensive.\\xa0 And we’ll be able to help other countries after we take care of our needs.\\n\\nYes, please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, thank you, sir.\\xa0 On infrastructure spending, as you have remarked —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I actually choose you, but that’s okay.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Oh, I’m sorry.\\xa0 I’ll let —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’ll let him go.\\xa0 That’s all right.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 On infrastructure, you have remarked about how empty the roads are.\\xa0 Is there any thought, is there any way to speed up infrastructure?\\xa0 I mean, the beltway in Washington, it takes forever to do any road repairs, because of all the traffic —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I know.\\xa0 And because they don’t do construction techniques that work and that are better.\\xa0 I mean, I see a highway and that’s — which is what I do.\\xa0 I do construction — what I did.\\n\\nI see highway that’s good but it’s got a bad top, and it’s got a big base — concrete base underneath.\\xa0 And I’ll see them come in — I don’t want to say where, but I could tell you; I could give you plenty of examples — and they rip the hell out of it.\\xa0 They take out the base.\\xa0 They take out everything.\\xa0 Now they pour a new base that isn’t as good, isn’t as deep, isn’t as thick.\\xa0 The concrete base was fantastic — the footing.\\xa0 It takes forever.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What I mean is —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Wait a minute.\\xa0 It takes forever.\\xa0 And instead of scraping out the asphalt, or whatever may be the top — scraping it off and putting the new asphalt down, putting the new median in.\\xa0 They could have done it.\\n\\nAnd then they open the highway and it starts to crack.\\xa0 The reason is because it hasn’t been set.\\xa0 And they spend 10, 15, 20 times more money than they have to.\\xa0 I never believe, when I watch these people doing highways and doing roadways and doing work, how they take the most expensive solution.\\xa0 And the bottom line: The job itself is far worse.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So that’s — that’s what I’m getting at, is taking advantage of the fact that so many people are staying at home —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — not on the roads.\\xa0 Is there a way to do it more cheaply and efficiently?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, yeah, but hopefully they’re not going to be staying at home for long.\\xa0 Hopefully, this will be out and we’re not going to have that kind of time.\\xa0 If we have that kind of time, we made a big mistake.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 How many rapid tests has the federal government already deployed across the country?\\xa0 And which regions received those tests?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Who has that information?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I can speak about that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, Mike.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Deb can follow up.\\n\\nThe 15-minute test has really been a breakthrough.\\xa0 I’ve reflected on the progress that they’ve made in Detroit to put first responders back on duty with the Abbott Laboratories test.\\xa0 Abbott Laboratories started last Tuesday producing about 50,000 tests a day.\\n\\nAnd there’s — I’m informed of that there are about 18,000 of these machines already all across the country.\\xa0 I mean, they are — they’re actually the same machines that you use to get a strep test quickly when you go to the doctor.\\xa0 But now Abbott is surging these new 15-minute coronavirus tests out to healthcare professionals and healthcare facilities around the country.\\n\\nIn addition, as the President said, FEMA has purchased 1,200 of these devices.\\xa0 We’re distributing them to all 50 states and the Indian healthcare system, and then we’ll be distributing the tests.\\n\\nDr. Birx, is there anything to add further on that?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 That’s perfect, sir.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So (inaudible) these tests?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Let me ask Admiral Polowczyk about the 1,200 devices.\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 I didn’t hear the question.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Have they received the 1,200 or what’s the timetable?\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 I believe they’re on the shelf at Abbott — a good majority of them.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Tuesday they go out.\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\xa0 So, I don’t have the exact numbers.\\xa0 I think there is some manufacturing in there, but the large balance of them are on the shelf.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Some have gone out, by the way, but the big bulk of them go out on Tuesday.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, in some of these previous briefings, you referred to the federal government as the backup.\\xa0 Today, there’s definitely a different approach here, I think —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — with the distribution.\\xa0 The sense of it, in listening to your presentation today, is that you are embracing taking a leader role for distribution.\\xa0 Is there a change?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, there’s not a change, but we’re supposed to be the backup.\\xa0 But like in Illinois, the governor couldn’t do his job so we had to help him.\\xa0 We’re sending 600 ventilators.\\xa0 We’re building a hospital in McCormick Place.\\xa0 We’re doing it.\\n\\nSo we have some people that were not able to do.\\xa0 We have other people that needed a little help.\\xa0 We had — in New York, we had to give a lot of help, but we’ve worked very well with Governor Cuomo and with Mayor de Blasio.\\n\\nBut, no, we are meant to be the backup, but we’ve taken on a much bigger role than that, and that’s okay.\\xa0 I have no objection to it.\\n\\nNow, in some cases, it’s worked so well, where they’re actually now seeing — they think they’re over — over the big problem.\\xa0 And they’re actually calling us and they’re saying, “You can take your equipment back now.”\\xa0 But we’re really deployed as a backup, but I feel we’re much more than that.\\xa0 They’ve done a much better job.\\n\\nI will say this: I don’t think that the people that have represented this country, the federal government — whether it’s the Admiral and the generals and all of the people that we call to the fore — I just — they’re heroes for what they’ve done.\\xa0 What they’ve been able to do in a short period of time — they took a system that was broken, just like we did the military.\\xa0 Our military was broken.\\xa0 Our military was depleted and it was broken, and we’ve rebuilt our military.\\xa0 We’ve rebuilt this whole system too.\\n\\nAnd I — in a way, Kelly, I appreciate your question because, you know, you’re hearing all of the things that we’re — the millions of masks, the hundreds of thousands of gowns.\\xa0 And they’re surgical — you know, they’re protective gowns at the highest level.\\xa0 We’re getting it to the various states.\\xa0 And most of the governors are very happy.\\n\\nNow, a lot of times, you know, it’s politics.\\xa0 Maybe I do the same thing, I don’t know.\\xa0 But they’ll try and act not so happy.\\n\\nI will tell you, when I speak to them or when the Vice President speaks to them, they’re singing the praises of all of these people.\\xa0 So I always take umbrage when — when somebody says something about what we’ve done.\\n\\nNow, to do this — to do this should have taken —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And does the buck stop with you next, sir?\\xa0 Is that what has happened?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 To do what we’ve been able to do and to build it to a level, it should have taken a year.\\xa0 It should’ve taken two years.\\xa0 They did it in a matter of weeks.\\xa0 And we’re helping states.\\n\\nNo, it’s them.\\xa0 As an example, New York had the right to buy 16,000 ventilators.\\xa0 They could have bought them.\\xa0 They didn’t.\\xa0 I understand why they didn’t.\\xa0 It was a very expensive purchase.\\xa0 You know, a very expensive — and that’s a lot: 16,000.\\xa0 And they chose to do something else with their money.\\xa0 I understand that.\\xa0 The problem is when something like this comes along, which you don’t expect.\\n\\nLook, 1917 — that’s a long time ago — perhaps 100 million people died.\\xa0 That’s a long time ago.\\xa0 So people don’t think it’s going to happen.\\xa0 I would have, frankly — I mean, did anybody in this room think a thing like this could happen?\\xa0 But it happened. \\xa0And we built up a force.\\xa0 This is a military operation, as it turned out — it really is — with FEMA, with the Army Corps of Engineers.\\n\\nI mean, Army Corps of — and you were very gracious on that point.\\xa0 The Army Corps of Engineers is building 2,500 units of beds and everything else now.\\xa0 And then Governor Cuomo called and he wanted it to go COVID, meaning, for the problem.\\xa0 And we said, “Well, it wasn’t supposed to be that way, but we want to get it done.”\\xa0 And we’ve moved military personnel, so now military personnel are operating it.\\n\\nAnd I’ll tell you what’s — what’s good.\\xa0 It hasn’t been very full.\\xa0 That’s a good thing, not a bad thing.\\xa0 It hasn’t been.\\xa0 Now, maybe over the next week, something will happen, but it hasn’t been.\\n\\nBut we have — because it’s better than the other alternative where we run out.\\xa0 But they built actually 2,900 beds.\\xa0 And we have — also, we built four medical centers in New York.\\xa0 We’ve built four hospitals, four medical centers, and a lot more than that.\\n\\nIt’s such an honor to have done it.\\xa0 But the people that did it are amazing and they have to be appreciated by the states, not me.\\xa0 They don’t have appreciate me at all.\\xa0 I don’t care about me.\\xa0 They have to appreciate the generals, the admirals, the doctors, the nurses.\\n\\nI mean, we’re bringing now 3,000 people in that are medical professionals that are coming from all over the country to help New York City, help New York State, and help many other places.\\n\\nI just think it’s incredible what they’ve done, and I don’t think that they’ve been appreciated.\\xa0 Me, you can forget about. Me, you can forget —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Really, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Yeah, I rea- — I actually mean it.\\xa0 They have to be appreciated.\\n\\nGo in the back, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, when you said that you’re seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, and yesterday you said —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I do.\\xa0 I do.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I see light at the end of the tunnel.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But yesterday —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 If I didn’t, I would not be — I would not be very thrilled with what we’ve done.\\xa0 No, I see light at the end of the tunnel.\\xa0 I think indications are some of the numbers coming out today.\\xa0 I think, you know, we had a very good meeting today.\\xa0 We’re seeing things that we don’t even report because we think it’s too early to report.\\n\\nNo, I think, you know, we’re seeing things happen that are very good.\\xa0 And we also know — all of us, including the medical professionals — that we have to open our country up.\\xa0 We have to get go- — we have to open our country up.\\xa0 No country was designed for this, where you close it.\\xa0 We’re in the midst of the greatest economic boom in history for any country.\\xa0 Our country had the greatest economic boom in history.\\xa0 We had the most people working that we’ve ever had, almost 160 million people. \\xa0And then from 160 million, they want nobody to leave the house.\\n\\nYou know, you could use the term “cold turkey.”\\xa0 Right? That’s called “cold turkey.”\\xa0 Countries are not designed — this country is not designed for that.\\xa0 We have to get our country back.\\xa0 And I think it’s going to come back, and I hope it’s going to come back very quickly.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So my question, sir —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A question, sir —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, the First Lady has been tweeting and encouraging people to wear face masks.\\xa0 Has she —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s good.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Has she been talking to you about this —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, she feels that way.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — encouraging you to wear one?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 She feels that — I — I would wear one.\\xa0 I mean, I just — generally, I’m not in a — like, I should — would you like me to wear one right now and answer your question?\\xa0 That would be a little awkward, I guess.\\n\\nBut, no, I mean — again,\\xa0I would wear one if it was — if I thought it was important.\\n\\nShe — she thinks — she likes the idea of wearing it, yeah.\\xa0 She does.\\xa0 A lot of people do.\\xa0 Again, it’s a recommendation, and I understand that recommendation and I’m okay with it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What about your family in New York?\\xa0 Are they going to be wearing them?\\xa0 Are you encouraging them to wear them?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Wouldn’t be surprised.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can we hear from Dr. Fauci, Mr. President?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 What would you like to know?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If we’re going into this most difficult of times, how can the American people, sort of, emotionally prepare for that?\\xa0 And while the President is talking and is eager to see the country reopen, how do we balance the mitigating factors that still need to take place before we get to that point?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 Doctor?\\n\\nAnd, by the way, he — he’d like to see the company [sic] open too.\\xa0 I mean, you know —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Everyone would, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He’s called “an American who loves our country.”\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Okay, so part of the answer to your question, I think, relates to two other questions I heard.\\xa0 And I think it came from the back about how can you, on the one hand, have said yesterday that this is really going to be a bad week at the same time that we’re talking about the light at the end of the tunnel.\\n\\nIt seems to be inherently contradictory, but it really isn’t.\\xa0 And it has to do with what we explained before about the lag in when you look at the indications that Dr. Birx and the President was talking about, where you see a flattening out of cases, and you don’t see the realization of what that means until two weeks later.\\xa0 So right now, we’re seeing, as we all said correctly, that this is probably going to be a really bad week.\\xa0 That is a reflection of what happened two and a half weeks ago.\\n\\nSo if we start seeing now a flattening or stabilization of cases, what you’re hearing about potential light at the end of the tunnel doesn’t take away from the fact that tomorrow or the next day is going to look really bad.\\xa0 So we’ve got to make sure we realize we’re always talking about a two-and-a-half-week lag.\\nSo I want to make sure — because I think a couple of people asked that question.\\xa0 It’s really not incompatible with what we’re saying.\\n\\nNow, with regard to what do we tell the American people,\\xa0what — Kelly,\\xa0what we’ve been telling them all along, that the — the only tool, but the best tool we have is mitigation.\\xa0 We know it worked in other countries, and we’re seeing how it’s working here.\\xa0 So if we really want to make sure that we don’t have these kinds of rebounds that we’re worried about, it’s mitigation, mitigation, mitigation.\\xa0 That’s the answer.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 When new cities or new states come on the chart —\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — what’s the message for people in those places that have not been the focus?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 It’s the same thing.\\xa0 It’s mitigation mitigation, mitigation.\\xa0 In fact — (laughs) — (looks for chart) — here’s the famous Vice President chart — is that this is the minimal of what we should be doing.\\xa0 You know, everyone should be doing that.\\n\\nAnd everything on here, one way or the other, points to physical separation, whether it’s no crowds, whether it’s six feet, whether it’s staying away from theaters and restaurants or what have you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And churches and places of worship?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Exactly. \\xa0Exactly.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Doctor, are you worried at all about people becoming complacent?\\xa0 Are you worried — I mean, because a couple of days of this, I think people are about ready to go nuts staying in their house.\\xa0 And I’m just curious, are you worried at all that after, you know, seven days from now, people are going to say, “Look, I gave it my best shot.\\xa0 I got to get out”?\\xa0 I mean —\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 You know, I wouldn’t say I’m worried about it because I don’t think it’s going to happen.\\xa0 I mean, from what I’ve seen — and I mentioned it the other day — my own experience is that people really understand the responsibility that they have for themselves, for their family, and for the country.\\xa0 So this is about all of us.\\xa0 This isn’t just about us.\\xa0 Because if everybody does their part, you are going to not have those kind of rebounds that we’re worried about.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Fauci, how many additional asymptomatic cases do you think there are currently in the United States?\\xa0 There’s 330,000 more confirmed cases.\\xa0 How many asymptomatic, given what we’ve learned in recent days?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 You know, we don’t know.\\xa0 And even among us, good friends that we are — (laughs) — we — we differ about that.\\xa0 I mean, it’s somewhere between 25 and 50 percent.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 More than —\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Yeah, in other words, about the people —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — the current level?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, about the people that are out there.\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nAnd trust me, that is a estimate.\\xa0 I don’t have any scientific data yet to say that.\\xa0 You know when we’ll get the scientific data, when we get those antibody tests out there and we really know what the penetrance is.\\xa0 Then we can answer the questions in a scientifically sound way.\\xa0 Right now, we’re just guessing.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And we’ve made great progress with the antibody testing.\\xa0 Fantastic progress.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And would you also weigh in on this issue of hydroxychloroquine?\\xa0 What do you think about this?\\xa0 And what is the — what is the medical evidence?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Do you know how many times you’ve answered that question?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But I’d love to hear from the doctor.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Maybe 15.\\xa0 Fifteen times.\\xa0 You don’t have to ask the question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 He’s — he’s your medical expert, correct?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He’s answered that question 15 times.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Fauci, why are you not wearing a facemask?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 What do you mean? \\xa0Why am I not wearing a face mask now?\\xa0 Okay, there are a couple of reasons.\\xa0 One of them is that part of the — in fact, the major reason to wear a facemask is to protect you from infecting you.\\xa0 I had my test yesterday, and it’s negative.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0That’s a very — a very good answer.\\xa0 All right, I think that really could be it.\\xa0 That was a very — I love that answer, especially on the facemask.\\xa0 I thought it was very good.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, on the equipment issue, records show that federal agencies did not begin —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, stop it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — did not begin —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Who are you with?\\xa0 By the way, who are you with?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 With the Associated Press, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Who you with?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The Associated Press.\\xa0 Agencies didn’t begin bulk —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s another beautiful — that’s another beautiful (inaudible) —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — bulk purchases of respirators and N95 masks until mid-March.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Are you ready?\\xa0 Are you ready? \\xa0Let me just\\nanswer your question because I know exactly — you know, the same question you ask all the time.\\xa0 Ready?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s the first time I’ve asked this, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They have done an unbelievable job in delivering —\\n\\nFor the Associated Press, which is, you know, not so great, not like it used to be.\\n\\nThe people that you’re looking at — FEMA, the military — what they’ve done is a miracle.\\xa0 What they’ve done is a miracle in getting all of this stuff.\\xa0 What they’ve done for states is incredible.\\xa0 And you should be thanking them for what they’ve done, not always asking wise-guy questions.\\n\\nThank you very much, everybody.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nEND\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\n\\n8:21 P.M.

       "  'text': 'James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\\n\\nApril 4, 2020\\n4:15 P.M. EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s a busy time.\\xa0 Very busy time.\\xa0 And let me begin by again expressing our support, solidarity, and love for the people of our great country.\\xa0 We’re fighting for you and we’re enduring all of this together.\\xa0 And we will soon prevail together.\\xa0 We’re making a lot of progress.\\n\\nWe appreciate all of the great assistance from the governors and people within the states.\\xa0 The relationships have been, really, very good.\\xa0 I spoke with Governor Cuomo.\\xa0 We’re working very hard to get additional things to New York as quickly as possible.\\n\\nWe — as you know, we took care of the hospital, including personnel — the 2,500 beds that we build just recently at Javits, including personnel.\\xa0 And we opened it up to COVID, and that’s something that we also did in Louisiana, and we’re doing it in Dallas.\\n\\nSo we have a lot of not only hospitals being built, but now we’re manning the hospitals because states are, in many cases, unable to get additional people to work.\\xa0 It’s — it’s just an incredible situation.\\xa0 There’s never been anything like this.\\n\\nOne of the most important issues in battling this pandemic is coordinating the delivery of the crucial supplies throughout the nation based upon the most accurate information available.\\xa0 And we’ve got the best healthcare and disaster experts anywhere in the world, and everybody will tell you that, and we’re dealing with big parts of the world on helping them also through this horrible situation where 151 — still, 151 nations are going through it.\\n\\nWe’re working to ensure that the supplies are delivered where and when they’re needed, and in some cases, we’re telling governors we can’t go there because we don’t think you need it and we think someplace else needs it.\\xa0 And pretty much, so far, we’ve been right about that.\\xa0 And we’ll continue to do it.\\n\\nAs it really gets — this will be probably the toughest week between this week and next week.\\xa0 And there’ll be a lot of death, unfortunately, but a lot less death than if this wasn’t done.\\xa0 But there will be death.\\n\\nWe’re looking for an obvious focus in the hardest-hit regions.\\xa0 Some of them are obvious and some aren’t so obvious.\\xa0 They spring up.\\xa0 They come and they — they hit you like you got hit by a club, an area that wasn’t at all bothered.\\xa0 You look at what’s going on in New Jersey — the governor is doing an excellent job, by the way — but how that sprang up.\\n\\nEvery decision that we’re making is made to save lives.\\xa0 It’s really our sole consideration.\\xa0 We want to save lives.\\xa0 We want as few lives lost as possible.\\xa0 It’s therefore critical that certain media outlets stop spreading false rumors and creating fear and even panic with the public.\\xa0 It’s just incredible.\\xa0 I could name them, but it’s the same ones.\\xa0 Always the same ones.\\xa0 I guess they’re looking for ratings.\\xa0 I don’t know what they’re looking for.\\xa0 So bad for our country and so bad — the people understand it.\\xa0 You look at the levels and approval ratings, and they’re the lowest they’ve ever been for media. \\xa0It’s so bad for — for our country.\\xa0 So bad for the world.\\xa0 You ought to put it together for a little while, get this over with, and then go back to your fake news.\\n\\nDuring a national emergency, it’s just essential that the federal decision makers cut through the fog of confusion in order to follow the facts and the science.\\xa0 Many hospital administrators that we’ve been in touch with, even in the really hotspots — you know what they are — are communicating directly with us that their level of supplies are meeting essential needs.\\xa0 And at the current time, they’re really thrilled to be where they are.\\xa0 Whenever local shortages are reported, we’re asking states to immediately meet the demand.\\xa0 And we’re stockpiling large amounts in different areas — in different areas.\\xa0 And we’re going to be discussing that in a little while.\\n\\nBut we want distributions to be made on a fair basis.\\xa0 We have to take care of a large country, not just certain areas of the country.\\xa0 But no matter where we’re — we’ve been there and we’ve been there very strongly.\\xa0 I want to thank FEMA.\\xa0 I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers.\\xa0 I want to thank our military for what they’re doing.\\n\\nAnd we’re going to be adding a tremendous amount of military to help supplement the states — thousands of soldiers, thousands of medical workers, professionals, nurses, doctors.\\xa0 And it’ll be a large number.\\xa0 It’ll be — we’ll be telling them over the next very short period where they’re going.\\xa0 And they’re going into war.\\xa0 They’re going into a battle that they’ve never really trained for.\\xa0 Nobody has trained for this; nobody has seen this, I would say, since 1917, which was the greatest of them all.\\xa0 The greatest of this type of battle.\\xa0 Probably the greatest of them all. Right?\\xa0 1917.\\xa0 Up to 100 million people were killed.\\n\\nIn addition, we’re working directly with hospitals and existing suppliers and distributors to ensure that those with the greatest need are prioritized.\\xa0 And that need changes.\\xa0 One day it’s one state or one locale, one city.\\xa0 And then all of a sudden, they’re starting to do well.\\xa0 We had some very good reports coming out of the State of Washington, coming out of various parts of California — so, areas that we were getting ready to really hit hard.\\xa0 We can now go to other areas.\\n\\nIt looks like New York is going to be hit very hard.\\xa0 And Louisiana is just amazing the way it just sprang up.\\xa0 And everyone is doing a good job but they’re going to be hit hard.\\n\\nAreas in the country that are not experiencing large-scale infections are requesting supplies beyond what their present circumstances require.\\xa0 And we talk to them and we tell them and we explain it, and for the most part they’re good with it.\\xa0 We think we’re right.\\n\\nIt’s very understandable that officials would seek to get the most they can get for their communities, but the fears of the shortages have led to inflated requests.\\xa0 We have some states and areas where they’re just asking for far more.\\xa0 I mean, look, we had one state asking for 40,000 ventilators.\\xa0 Forty thousand.\\xa0 Think of it: 40,000.\\xa0 It’s not possible.\\xa0 They won’t need that many, and now they’re admitting they don’t need that many.\\xa0 But we’re getting as many as we can to them.\\n\\nAgain, nobody has ever seen anything like this in terms of ventilators, in terms of protective equipment and uniforms and outfits.\\xa0 But it makes it more difficult for distributors to prioritize the real need, and it could intentionally and, you know — look, they — everybody has proper intentions but they want to make sure they’re 100 percent.\\xa0 And sometimes, when they know they don’t need it, they want it anyway.\\xa0 It gives them that extra feeling of satisfaction, but we just can’t do that.\\xa0 It’s not even possible to think about it.\\n\\nAnd that’s why — and we’re a backup.\\xa0 Remember, we’re a backup.\\xa0 We’re the greatest backup that ever existed for the states, especially when we start getting into the hospital building business and getting into the medical center building business, where you see we built many hospitals — numerous hospitals in some states — and medical centers.\\n\\nThat’s why my administration has been requesting actual usage numbers directly from the states and hospitals to meet their needs, because we want to be ready when — when the brunt of it comes, which is coming quickly; you see it.\\xa0 You see it as sure as you can see it.\\xa0 And when the brunt of it comes, we want to be ready to hit the area that needs it.\\xa0 We don’t want to have spent everything in one area, and they don’t need it there to anywhere near the extent.\\n\\nSo let me be extremely clear about one point: We will move heaven and earth to safeguard our great American citizens.\\xa0 We will continue to use every power, every authority, every single resource we’ve got to keep our people healthy, safe, secure, and to get this thing over with.\\xa0 We want to finish this war.\\xa0 We have to get back to work.\\xa0 We have to get — we have to open our country again.\\xa0 We have to open our country again.\\xa0 We don’t want to be doing this for months and months and months.\\xa0 We’re going to open our country again.\\xa0 This country wasn’t meant for this.\\xa0 Few were.\\xa0 Few were.\\xa0 But we have to open our country again.\\n\\nI just spoke with the commissioners, leaders of, I would say, virtually all of the sports leagues: Rob Manfred, Commissioner of Baseball, Major League Baseball; Roger Goodell Commissioner of the National Football League; Adam Silver Commissioner of the National Basketball Association; Gary Bettman, Commissioner of the National Hockey League; Jay Monahan, Commissioner of the PGA Tour; Cathy Engelbert, Commissioner of the Women’s National Basketball Association; Dana White, the Ultimate Fighting Championship; Vince McMahon President of the WWE; Don Garber, Commissioner of Major League Soccer; Steve Phelps, President of NASCAR; Michael Whan, Commissioner of the LPGA; Roger Penske, Founder and Chairman Penske Corp.; and Drew Fleming, President of the Breeders’ Cup.\\n\\nAnd there were a couple of others on, and these are all the great leaders of sport.\\xa0 And they want to get back.\\xa0 They got to get back.\\xa0 They can’t do this.\\xa0 Their sports weren’t designed for it.\\xa0 The whole concept of our nation wasn’t designed for it.\\xa0 We’re going to have to get back.\\xa0 We want to get back soon — very soon.\\n\\nFor example — and I have to say, we’re using the Defense Production Act very powerfully.\\xa0 In some cas- — times directly; in many cases, indirectly.\\xa0 Just the threat of it is usually enough.\\n\\nBut FEMA and HHS have ordered 180 million — think of that — 180 million.\\xa0 Who ever heard of 180 million N95 masks?\\xa0 And we’re working now with 3M to see whether or not that all works out, but we want them to help our country.\\xa0 And I think it’s going to be okay.\\xa0 We’re going to soon let you know.\\xa0 But we need the masks.\\xa0 We don’t want other people getting it, and that’s why we’re — that’s why we’re instituting a lot of Defense Production Act, you could call it, retaliations because that’s what it is; it’s a retaliation.\\n\\nIf people don’t — if people don’t give us what we need for our people, we’re going to be very tough, and we’ve been very tough.\\xa0 Usually we don’t have to use it, but we’ve used it plenty.\\xa0 It’s turning out more and more, unfortunately.\\xa0 And it works very well.\\n\\nOur Supply Chain Logistics Task Force, led by Admiral John Polowczyk, who’s doing a fantastic job, will ensure they’re distributed to the healthcare and critical infrastructure workers in the areas with the most pressing requirements.\\xa0 That’s the 60 million masks that we’re talking about and the hundred and — 180 million N95 masks.\\xa0 A hundred and eighty million.\\xa0 Who ever heard of 180 million masks?\\n\\nAnd this is a incredible thing.\\xa0 A lot of times — and we have to stop playing this game — if a governor wants 200 ventilators, and I say, “No, we’re going to send you 1,000.\\xa0 We think you need more than 200,” and then the media meets with the governor and they say, “Oh, you got more.\\xa0 Well, it’s not enough.\\xa0 The President should have sent more.”\\xa0 So he’s asking for 200.\\xa0 We give him 1,000.\\xa0 They say, “How’s the President doing?”\\xa0 “He should have given more.”\\xa0 Because that’s politics.\\xa0 That’s politics.\\xa0 And that’s unfortunate, because we can’t play that game.\\n\\nAnd, you know, that’s one party doing it, and the other party is happy.\\xa0 But they’re all really happy because they should have been doing this work themselves for a long period of time.\\xa0 Many of their cupboards were bare.\\n\\nWith respect to the ventilators, FEMA and HHS continue to monitor the data on an hourly basis where provided by the states.\\xa0 In order to most effectively target the distribution of supplies, we’ve been asking states to provide us with daily updates on the number of ventilators and their utilization rates, because some states have more ventilators than they need.\\xa0 They don’t even like to admit it.\\xa0 They’ll admit it when everything is over, but that’s — it doesn’t help us very much.\\n\\nThis data is vitally necessary so that we can ensure ventilators are getting to the right place at the right time.\\xa0 FEMA, HHS, DOD are developing resources within the next 24 hours.\\xa0 They will have a whole different set of criteria.\\xa0 Every day, it’s different criteria.\\xa0 Every day, this horrible, invisible enemy changes a course.\\xa0 It changes course.\\n\\nIf you were fighting the normal fight, you’d know what’s happening.\\xa0 Here is: They hit one, they hit another, they hit another state.\\xa0 They hit areas that you didn’t expect.\\xa0 But we’re watching it and we’re capturing it.\\n\\nOur goal is to stay several days ahead of the needs in each state, but we can only do that if the cities and states utilize real-time local knowledge to provide timely and precise data about actual usage.\\xa0 So we have to be able to do that.\\xa0 And if a state has ventilators, as an example, that they know they’re not going to need, they should give them over and we should move them with the other ones.\\xa0 We have now 10,000 in our pipeline, and stockpiled 10,000 — close.\\n\\nAnd we’re moving some into New York, so we’re going to need some additional.\\xa0 We’re moving some into New York City and state, separately.\\xa0 And we’re bringing them to the point where they’ll need them.\\n\\nI can also report that, at my direction, 1,000 military personnel are deploying to New York City to assist where they’re needed the most.\\xa0 That’s the hottest of all the hotspots.\\xa0 New Jersey is right there.\\xa0 It’s right next to it.\\xa0 And I don’t know if that’s overflow, but New Jersey is — it’s a great state and it’s a very — it’s a crowded state also, where you have people on top of people.\\xa0 It’s always tough.\\xa0 But we’re bringing some of the ventilators.\\xa0 We got some for New Jersey just yesterday, and we’re going to bring them some more, including doctors.\\n\\nWe’re getting doctors, nurses, respiratory specialists, and other support workers.\\xa0 These are from the military.\\xa0 We’re taking people now out of our military.\\xa0 We’ve been doing it, but now we’re doing it on a larger basis.\\xa0 And I want to thank Secretary of Defense Esper, who will detail some of what we’re doing, tomorrow and Monday.\\n\\nAs the situation in Washington State continues to stabilize, we’re returning a 300-bed federal medical station to a different location — so where we need it.\\xa0 And we appreciate that.\\xa0 They won’t be needing it, and we appreciate them letting us know.\\xa0 We’re going to move it to a different location.\\xa0 It was already built.\\n\\nMany governors initially made large requests for federal support for their states in anticipation of a greater number of cases, but the residents of Washington State have done a really good job of following the federal distancing guidelines.\\xa0 They really have.\\n\\nI’m also pleased to report that Oregon will be spending and sending — they’re spending a lot of money because they really did stockpile well, and they’re also sending 140 ventilators directly to New York, which we appreciate.\\n\\nAnd I want to thank the Vice President for the great work he’s doing every day, dealing with our nation’s governors.\\xa0 Mike Pence has been working day and night on this, and we want to get it over.\\xa0 He’s got to get a little more sleep than he’s getting.\\xa0 He hasn’t been getting very much, I will tell you that.\\n\\nAnd we’re all in this together, and it’s a beautiful thing to see how people are joining forces to help one another.\\xa0 They really are.\\n\\nIn addition to our courageous doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers, I also want to thank the incredible food supply workers who are feeding our nation.\\xa0 I spoke just a little while ago to Senator Boozman.\\xa0 You know Senator Boozman; we all do.\\xa0 He’s a great senator.\\xa0 He’s a great person.\\xa0 We spoke just this morning, and we discussed how important it is to keep our farmers and ranchers, processors, and distributors in our nation’s prayers.\\xa0 And I want to thank the senator for the incredible job he’s been doing.\\xa0 And a lot of the senators and congressmen and everyone — everybody is working very hard.\\n\\nMy administration is working very aggressively to pioneer new medical countermeasures to treat and prevent infection.\\xa0 Working on a lot of things.\\xa0 We must utilize our nation’s scientific brilliance to vanquish the virus.\\xa0 We have to vanquish the virus as quickly as we can, because we have a lot of things happening in this country, and we have a great future, but we have to get back to work.\\n\\nThis week, the FDA established the Coronavirus Treatment Accelerator Program, which is expediting the development of new anti- — antiviral and other therapies, and they’re doing it on a very rapid basis.\\xa0 And I think we’re having some very good results.\\xa0 We’ll tell you about that.\\n\\nHHS continues to speed the development of therapies derived from human blood that have the potential to lessen the severity or shorten the length of the illness.\\xa0 And as you know, last Saturday, the FDA also gave emergency authorization for hydroxychloroquine.\\xa0 And the hydroxychloroquine is a — I hope it’s going to be a very important answer.\\xa0 We’re having some very good things happening with it, and we’re going to be distributing it through the Strategic National Stockpile.\\xa0 It’s going into the Strategic National Stockpile to treat certain patients.\\xa0 And we have millions and millions of doses of it; 29 million to be exact.\\n\\nIn addition to that, we’re making it and we’re also getting it from various other locations and countries.\\xa0 In one case, I called Prime Minister Modi of India this morning.\\xa0 They make large amounts of hydroxychloroquine — very large amounts, frankly.\\xa0 And I said — they had a hold, because, you know, they have 1.5. billion people, and they think a lot of it.\\xa0 And I said I’d appreciate it if they would release the amounts that we ordered.\\xa0 And they are giving it serious consideration.\\xa0 But they do make — India makes a lot of it.\\n\\nBut we have already 29 million.\\xa0 If you look — I mean, that’s a big number.\\xa0 Twenty-nine million doses.\\xa0 And we’ve got millions of doses that are being made here and many millions of doses that are made elsewhere that are being shipped here, and it will be arriving.\\n\\nWe’re just hearing really positive stories, and we’re continuing to collect the data.\\xa0 But I’ll just speak for myself: It’s been out for a long time. \\xa0It’s a malaria drug.\\xa0 It’s also a drug for lupus.\\xa0 And there’s a — there’s a study out that people with lupus aren’t catching this horrible virus.\\xa0 They’re not — they’re not affected so much by it.\\xa0 Now, maybe that’s correct; maybe it’s false.\\xa0 You’re going to have to check it out.\\n\\nBut there’s a lot of very positive things happening with that.\\xa0 That’s a game changer if that’s the case.\\xa0 Obviously, we continue to work on the vaccines, but the vaccines have to be down the road by probably 14, 15, 16 months.\\xa0 We’re doing great on the vaccines.\\xa0 I think Johnson & Johnson is leading — seems to be leading in terms of the studies, but we’ll see what happens.\\xa0 But I feel good about that, but that’s down the road.\\n\\nBut tremendous promise with — with what’s just been mentioned.\\xa0 In addition to that, Gilead Sciences has initiated a phase three that’s down the line, meaning clinical studies of the drug remdesivir.\\xa0 Now, it’s approximately 1,000 patients, which is a pretty — pretty good study.\\xa0 Other drugs are also being studied in patients.\\n\\nAnd this week, Oracle, a great company, donated a new web portal — Larry Ellison, amazing guy — and platform to the government to gather real-time data on how patients are responding to the various new treatments.\\xa0 And they have a very sophisticated site, we’ll be learning a lot from Oracle.\\xa0 And thank you to them.\\n\\nWe’re also spending economic dollars like you wouldn’t believe, and speeding economic relief to American workers, families, and businesses.\\xa0 Yesterday, the Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck Protection Program to help employees keep paying their workers.\\xa0 In 24 hours, the Small Business Administration, and over 1,200 lending partners, processed over 28,000 loans — it’s, so far, ahead of schedule — and billions and billions of dollars.\\n\\nIt’s worked out incredibly well, and I want to thank Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, and a lot of the big banks that have been involved, and a lot of the community banks.\\xa0 Community banks have really jumped on it.\\xa0 And it’s, so far, going way ahead of schedule.\\n\\nThe SBA also clarified that faith-based organizations, including houses of worship, are eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program — that’s great — as well as the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program that you’re familiar with, on the same terms as every other applicant.\\n\\nIf we run out of funding for the employee retention program, I will immediately ask Congress for more money.\\xa0 This is money that’s really going directly to the people that need it — the small businesses that need it and the workers that need it.\\n\\nFinally, I can — because when we open, we want to open strong, with businesses that are going.\\xa0 Remember, we had the greatest economy in the world, and then one day, we were told we got to shut it down, stop it, tell everyone to stay home, because of this horrible virus.\\xa0 And we did that, and we did the right thing.\\xa0 But now we have to open.\\xa0 We have to open our country.\\n\\nFinally, I can report that as of today, the State Department has successfully coordinated the safe return of more than 40,000 Americans stuck abroad on over 400 flights from 75 countries.\\xa0 Many of those countries were terrific in helping us, and I appreciate that very much.\\n\\nSome of them, I had to call the leaders of the country, most of whom I know.\\xa0 And once I did, they snapped, like you wouldn’t believe.\\xa0 They really helped us great.\\xa0 So I appreciate that.\\xa0 So we brought back 40,000 Americans who were literally stuck in some countries, with no chance of getting out, and we got them back.\\xa0 Four hundred flights, seventy-five countries.\\xa0\\xa0 Think of that.\\xa0 And those countries, in almost every instance, had a big problem with the virus.\\n\\nI want to thank the American people, most of all, for the selfless sacrifices that they’re making for our nation.\\xa0 I know it’s not pleasant, although some people have said they’ve gotten to know their family better, and they love their family more than ever, and that’s a beautiful thing.\\xa0 They’ve actually gotten to know them.\\xa0 They’re in the same house with their family for a long time.\\xa0 I guess it can also work the other way, perhaps, but we don’t want to talk about that.\\n\\nAnd I want to encourage everyone to keep following our guidelines on slowing the spread.\\xa0 Sustaining this war effort is — and that’s what it is; this is a war effort — is the patriotic duty of every citizen.\\xa0 While we may be more physically distant for a time, we’re closer together in the heart and in the spirit.\\n\\nAnd through this, great national unity is happening.\\xa0 We’re having a great unity developing that a lot of people didn’t think would be possible to develop like this.\\n\\nAnd we will conquer the disease and restore our nation to its full and glorious might.\\xa0 We’re doing really well, and I’m very proud of everybody out there.\\xa0 We’re very proud of you.\\xa0 It’s something that nobody could have ever projected.\\xa0 It’s been over 100 years that a thing like this has happened.\\n\\nAnd the problem with this one is the contagion.\\xa0 It’s so contagious.\\xa0 Nobody has ever seen anything like that where it’s so contagious.\\xa0 You can be feet away and just talking to somebody and catch it.\\xa0 You can catch it.\\xa0 You know how long it can live on surfaces.\\xa0 So things that nobody even thought of, the level of contagion.\\n\\nSo, we’re getting there.\\xa0 We’re going to make sure that it’s over soon.\\xa0 And just keep going.\\xa0 It’s not going to be long.\\n\\nAnd thank you very much.\\xa0 And with that, I’d like to ask Dr. Hahn to speak.\\xa0 And he’s been doing yeoman’s work at the FDA.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\xa0 Doctor, thank you.\\n\\nDR. HAHN:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 I’m going to speak about hydroxychloroquine and the efforts around that.\\xa0 Just to preface, I’d like to echo what the President said about the American people and the resiliency and the just terrific work.\\xa0 Mitigation is such an important part of our fight against the COVID-19 virus.\\n\\nLast week, as the President said, we issued an emergency use authorization to allow the donated hydroxychloroquine to come into the country and enter the general circulation.\\xa0 We are prioritizing this drug to come in for clinical trials, and also into general use for physicians, because as you know, physicians, based upon their interaction with the patients, their assessment of the risks and benefits can write a prescription for hydroxychloroquine if they think it’s appropriate for the patient.\\xa0 Being a physician, we do this all the time.\\xa0 And that assessment needs to be done between a patient and a doctor.\\n\\nAnd then the third portion is we wanted to make sure that these drugs were in the circulation — in the supply chain, so that people who have them or need them for the other indications — lupus, rheumatoid arthritis — had them available.\\xa0 So that was the purpose of the emergency use authorization.\\n\\nOne other thing I’d like to mention is that we, on Friday, stood up a formal convalescent plasma program.\\xa0 We have a great deal of enthusiasm for that.\\xa0 There are some reports that this is a benefit to patients in other countries who have had the COVID-19 virus.\\n\\nAnd what this means is taking plasma from patients who have had the virus and who have recovered, and transferring the immunity — the immunoglobulins, if you will — the immunity from that person to someone who’s sick.\\xa0 And we’re hopefully expanding that across the country.\\xa0 The Red Cross is involved in that program.\\xa0 And I think it shows a great promise.\\xa0 It needs to be studied like other things.\\xa0 But just like I said before, it provides hope.\\xa0 We don’t want to provide false hope, but definitely hope.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Tony, please.\\n\\nMR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Thank you very much, Mr. President.\\xa0 I’d like to just take a couple of moments to talk a little bit about the public health aspects and how it relates to what the President just said about the need for us to begin to at least think about returning to some degree of normality.\\xa0 And that has to do with what’s going to be happening as we end this week and we go into next week.\\n\\nYou will be seeing — and we should not be surprised because the kinetics of how this virus works — is that we’re going to be seeing that there are going to be deaths that are going to continue to go up.\\xa0 But as I mentioned to this group and to the general public multiple times, there really is a cascading of events where you have new cases, hospitalizations, intensive care, and deaths.\\xa0 So at the same time that we may be seeing an increase in deaths, we want to focus on the effective mitigation is really the number of new cases.\\xa0 And that’s what we’re going to be thinking about and looking about.\\n\\nSo we’re going to pay close attention to that, and hopefully the kinds of mitigations that we’re talking about are going to have the impact to allow us to begin to think about maybe changing a bit.\\n\\nSo the question arises is: Is the mitigation working?\\xa0 So let’s look historically and then just look at the reality of it.\\xa0 Clearly, in the countries — China included — that have implemented very strict kinds of programs of mitigation, clearly it works.\\xa0 In our own country, we’ve seen indication of that in Washington.\\xa0 Remember, Washington State was the first to get hit.\\xa0 But they put in a really good program of mitigation.\\xa0 And if you look at the charts that Dr. Birx showed the other day, they’re still down, they’re doing well.\\n\\nAnd the reason is — again, what I’ve said before, but I think it’s worth reiterating — that we have two opposing forces here: the virus, which wants to do what the virus wants to do.\\xa0 Viruses transmit from people to people.\\xa0 When people are separated from each other, virus does not transmit; it doesn’t go anywhere.\\xa0 And that’s the reason why something as simple as the physical separation — because if you look at the Vice President’s chart that he shows all the time here from this podium, every aspect of that, ending the COVID outbreak in 30 days, has some aspect of it, a physical separation — whether that’s avoiding crowds, whether that staying six feet away from people, whether that’s doing teleworking.\\xa0 All of it does that.\\xa0 That’s our most important tool.\\xa0 We’ll be talking about vaccines and drugs and things like that that will mitigate later.\\xa0 But this is what we really have to do.\\n\\nAnd I want to — I want to actually just plea, as I do multiple times from here, to the American public: You know, as sobering and as difficult as this is, what we are doing is making a difference.\\xa0 So we really need to continue to do that.\\n\\nI must tell you, I was just mentioning to the Vice President as we came in: Last night, when I wasn’t here, I went out with my wife and actually did a little powerwalking down Massachusetts Avenue — for those who live in Washington, know what I’m talking about — and we passed a couple of restaurants where people were getting takeout food.\\xa0 The restaurants were closed to people going in, but they were open to takeout.\\n\\nAnd I saw something that absolutely made me feel really, really good.\\xa0 They were separating themselves by at least six feet.\\xa0 In fact, some of the restaurants had little things on the floor that said, “Stand here” and then “Stand there.”\\n\\nAnd I think if we as a nation pulled together to do that, hopefully when we keep coming back here at these press conferences, we’ll be able to show you that that curve that we keep talking about is going in the right direction.\\n\\nAnd I’d be happy to answer questions later.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Okay, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you said earlier that the virus is springing up in areas you did not expect.\\xa0 Yesterday you said some states in the country are not in jeopardy.\\xa0 The fact that this is unpredictable, isn’t that an argument for every state to have one of these stay-at-home orders?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t think so.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Why?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Look, there are some states that are — you have great distance, natural distance.\\xa0 Big land, few people. And they’re in very good shape.\\xa0 And if there is a case, they can quarantine that person, or that person will be separated, will be brought to a hospital, a secure area.\\n\\nSo you do have different cases as opposed to a New York or Los Angeles.\\xa0 Los Angeles is doing incredibly well, by the way.\\xa0 But areas we have lots of people tight together.\\xa0 It’s a big difference.\\n\\nSo, no, it’s — they’re different — there are many different cases.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, You mentioned the military off at the top.\\xa0 So 1,000 troops going to New York, and then are we expecting other mass deployments around the country?\\xa0 And then is it just Army?\\xa0 Is it —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, not mass.\\xa0 Many of the places are really in great shape.\\xa0 They really have done a fantastic job.\\xa0 And we may add to the thousand.\\xa0 But New York will be getting about 1,000 military people — nurses, doctors, lots of other people — because that’s what they need.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So medical military?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Not — like not combat —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And that’s — medical.\\xa0 No, no, medical military.\\xa0 Medical military.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, you tweeted earlier today that you like the idea of a second coronavirus task force that was focused on reopening the economy.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thinking about it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So I was wondering if you were planning to go forward with that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thinking about it.\\xa0 Getting a group of people.\\xa0 And we have to open our country.\\xa0 You know, I had an expression: “The cure can’t be worse than the problem itself.” Right?\\xa0 I started by saying that and I continue to say it: The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself.\\xa0 We’ve got to get our country open.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, in terms of reopening, can you talk about your call with the sports commissioners?\\xa0 Did you say you’d like to see people back, fans back in arenas as soon as August?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Absolutely, I want — I want fans back in the arenas.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 By August, though, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think it’s — I think it’s — no.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is that safe?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Whenever we’re ready.\\xa0 I mean, as soon as we can, obviously.\\xa0 And the fans want to be back too.\\xa0 You know, they want to see basketball and baseball and football and hockey.\\xa0 They want to see their sports.\\xa0 They want to go out onto the golf courses and breathe nice, clean, beautiful fresh air.\\xa0 No, the —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 When do you think that people can be back, based on the science that you’re seeing?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I can’t tell you — I can’t tell you a date, but I think it’s going to be sooner rather than later.\\n\\nBut — and, you know, we’re not going to have to have separation for the rest of our times on the planet.\\xa0 We need it for this period of time.\\xa0 But eventually people are going to be able to occupy those seats and arenas, next to each other, like we have for all of my life and all of your life.\\xa0 They want to sit next to each other at restaurants.\\xa0 They don’t want to be, you know, six feet away.\\n\\nAnd some restaurant man called up, and he said, “You know, I’m worried because I have a small restaurant with not too many seats.”\\xa0 I think he said 120.\\xa0 And he said, “If I practice what this is, I’m down to 30 seats.\\xa0 I can’t make it.”\\xa0 I said, “Don’t worry about it.\\xa0 That’s for a short period of time. You’ll be back to your number of seats.”\\xa0 We can’t do that.\\xa0 Otherwise, you’re making everything — that means your stadium is half the size of what it was a month ago.\\n\\nNo, no, they’re going to be close together, but they’re going to be breathing air that’s not infected, that’s not going to kill people.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Since you’re not committing to packing the stadiums by August, what are your contingency plans —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I’m not committing to it.\\xa0 I’m not committing to it.\\xa0 We’re going to see where we are.\\xa0 That’d be great if we could.\\xa0 But we’re going to be back to good health soon, in my opinion.\\xa0 We’re making a lot of progress, and we’re making progress because, as Tony told the story about the restaurant and about how they were separated sort of automatically, people are doing that.\\xa0 People are doing that.\\xa0 They’re staying in their homes.\\xa0 They don’t want to go out.\\xa0 They’re doing what they know is the right thing to do.\\xa0 It’s — it’s not very complicated.\\xa0 It’s — in many ways, it’s a very beautiful thing to see.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But what are your contingency plans for the Republican National Convention?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We have no contingency plan.\\xa0 We’re having the convention at the end of August, and we think by the end of August, we’ll be in good shape.\\xa0 We have no contingen- — you know, it’s going to be in North Carolina, as you know, in Charlotte.\\xa0 And I think we’re going to have a great convention.\\n\\nI notice — I think we had an opponent, but I — I almost didn’t know who it was.\\xa0 He got .00001 percent of the vote.\\xa0 But I heard he dropped out three or four weeks ago.\\xa0 I’m not sure.\\xa0 Maybe you could tell me.\\xa0 That’s the kind of opponent I had.\\xa0 And hopefully we have another one just like that in Joe.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, this weekend, lawmakers are working on the next round release packages.\\xa0 What was not in the stimulus package that you signed last week that you would like to see in phase four?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think we’re going to need more money for the small businesses.\\xa0 It’s been working out so well.\\xa0 It’s been so efficient.\\xa0 The banks have been doing an incredible job.\\xa0 I think we’re going to need more money there, I think.\\xa0 You know, we’ll see.\\xa0 But based on the first — the first couple of days, it’s been incredible.\\n\\nI think that restaurants and entertainment — and that would be — include sports leagues, all forms of entertainment — go back to the original, where they get tax deductibility for what they’re doing and for people who come in and buy tickets or go out for meals.\\xa0 And corporations can then send people into these restaurants who are going to have a hard time, otherwise, opening, in my opinion.\\xa0 And that could be the same for the sports leagues.\\n\\nSo we want to see, for entertainment and for restaurants, deductibility so that corporations can take a deduction.\\xa0 They’ll send their executives, they’ll send people there, and they get a deduction.\\xa0 That is something that will really bring life back to the restaurants; I think make them hotter than before.\\n\\nYou know, they used to have it.\\xa0 And when they ended it, it was really never the same.\\xa0 It was never the same.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you just said that you want to see as few lives lost as possible in this pandemic.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s right.\\xa0 That’s right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But there are still eight governors, all Republicans, who have refused to issue these statewide stay-at-home orders.\\xa0 Your own experts, including Dr. Fauci, have said stay-at-home orders are the most effective way to stop the spread of this virus.\\xa0 So why not do everything possible —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, Tennessee just did it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and urge those governors right now —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — to do that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We have a thing called the Constitution, which I cherish, number one.\\xa0 Number two, those governors — I know every one of them — they’re doing a great job.\\xa0 They’re being very, very successful in what they’re doing.\\xa0 And as you know, I want the governors to be running things.\\n\\nNow, in some cases, we’ll supersede, but in this case it’s not —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you think they should, though?\\xa0 Do you think they should?\\xa0 I’m not asking for you to order them to, but —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think it depends — it depends on the individual state that you’re talking about.\\xa0 But they’re doing very well, and they’re doing a magnificent job in running their states.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, South Carolina has 1,700 cases right now of coronavirus.\\xa0 Utah has 1,255. \\xa0I mean, are these not states that you think should have those stay-at-home orders in place?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I think they’re doing a great job.\\n\\nWell, that’s a very small number relative to population.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s larger than some states that do have stay-at -home orders that are already in place.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s okay.\\xa0 It’s up to the — if I saw something wrong, I saw a massive breakout — of which that’s not — I would come down very hard.\\xa0 But —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Isn’t the key in this pandemic getting ahead of those numbers, though?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, not in that case.\\xa0 But in the case — I know the states you’re talking about.\\xa0 By the way, I think you’re up to 92 percent is covered.\\xa0 Ninety-two percent of the country is covered.\\xa0 And from a constitutional standpoint, they made the difference.\\xa0 They called the shots.\\n\\nYes, Jeff.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, just a question about messaging.\\xa0 You and the others here are saying people need to continue following the mitigation efforts, but you’re also saying, again, the cure must not be worse than the problem.\\xa0 Which is it?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I’m just saying we have to get this country open, Jeff.\\xa0 It has to get open.\\xa0 This country was not designed to be closed.\\xa0 So we have the greatest we’ve ever had, and then we’re paying people to stay home.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But you want it to be closed right now, right?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Think of it: We’re paying people not to go to work.\\xa0 How about that?\\xa0 How does that play?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I understand that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And they want to go to work, by the way.\\xa0 They don’t even want — they don’t want money.\\xa0 This country is great.\\xa0 But we’re paying people.\\xa0 We have to get back to work.\\xa0 That’s what I’m saying.\\n\\nGo ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, this is off topic.\\xa0 It’s about the announcement from last night.\\xa0 It’s a yes or no question, but not that we expect the answer to be yes or no.\\n\\nBut wasn’t Michael Atkinson doing the job of the Inspector General of the intelligence community, the job he was supposed to do, when he simply took the whistleblower complaint to Congress that hadn’t been taken previously?\\xa0 Wasn’t he doing the job that he was supposed to do, that American taxpayers were paying him to do?\\xa0 And why did you decide to terminate —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I thought he did a terrible job.\\xa0 Absolutely terrible.\\xa0 He took a whistleblower report, which turned out to be a fake report — it was fake.\\xa0 It was totally wrong.\\xa0 It was about my conversation with the President of Ukraine.\\xa0 He took a fake report and he brought it to Congress, with an emergency.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 Not a big Trump fan — that, I can tell you.\\n\\nInstead of saying — and we offered this to him: “No, no, we will take the conversation” — where, fortunately, we had that transcript.\\xa0 If we didn’t have a transcript with the kind of deception and dishonesty that were practiced by the Democrats, I might not be standing here right now.\\xa0 Okay? Fortunately, we had a transcript and it was a perfect transcript, because even the lieutenant colonel admitted it was correct.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nWait a minute.\\xa0 Wait a minute.\\xa0 You asked a question.\\n\\nSo he took this whistleblower — and I keep saying, “Where’s the whistleblower?”\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 “And why was the whistleblower allowed to do this?”\\xa0 Why was he allowed to be — you call it fraudulent or incorrect transcript.\\n\\nSo we offered this IG — I don’t know him; I don’t think I ever met him.\\xa0 I don’t think I — he never even came in to see me.\\xa0 How can you do that without seeing the person?\\xa0 Never came in to see me.\\xa0 Never requested to see me.\\xa0 He took this terrible, inaccurate whistleblower report — right? — and he brought it to Congress.\\n\\nWe offered to have him see my exact conversation.\\xa0 It was all about the conversation, by the way.\\xa0 That was the whole thing, was about the conversation.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 And then after he saw it, he must’ve said, “Wow,” because as I’ve said it many times and it drives you people crazy, it was a perfect conversation.\\n\\nSo instead of going and saying, “Gee, this is a terrible thing he said about the President’s conversation” — well, it was a fraud.\\xa0 I didn’t say that.\\xa0 And, by the way, you have the whistleblower.\\xa0 Where’s the informer?\\xa0 Right?\\n\\nAnd here’s another question: Remember before I did the — before I gave the transcript — in other words, before I revealed the real conversation — where’s the second whistleblower?\\xa0 Remember the second whistle —\\n\\nWait, wait, wait, wait.\\xa0 There was going to be a second whistleblower.\\xa0 But after I gave the conversation, he just went away.\\xa0 He miraculously went away.\\n\\nWhere’s the informer?\\xa0 Because there was going to be this informer.\\xa0 Maybe Schiff was the informer.\\xa0 You ever think of that?\\xa0 He’s a corrupt guy.\\xa0 He’s a corrupt politician.\\n\\nSo, listen, I say this: Where’s the informer?\\xa0 Remember, the informer was coming forward.\\xa0 But I gave — because, see, I did one thing that surprised everybody.\\xa0 This gentleman right here said, “Boy, that was a shocker.”\\xa0 I revealed the conversation.\\xa0 I got approval from Ukraine because I didn’t want to do it without their approval.\\xa0 And they said, “Absolutely.\\xa0 You did nothing wrong.”\\n\\nBy the way, President of Ukraine, Foreign Minister said, “He did nothing wrong.”\\xa0 And over that, with 196 to nothing vote by the Republicans — not one dissenting Republican vote — dishonest Democrats impeached a President of the United States.\\xa0 That man is a disgrace to IGs.\\n\\nAll right, let’s go.\\xa0 Next.\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 He’s a total disgrace.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, did you run by your decision to dismiss the Inspector General by Senator McConnell?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0 Okay, we’ll get off this because people want to talk about what we’re talking about.\\xa0 But let me just tell you something: That’s my decision.\\xa0 I have the absolute right.\\xa0 Even the fake news last night said, “He has the absolute right to do it.”\\n\\nBut ask him, “Why didn’t you go and see the actual conversation?”\\xa0 There was no rush.\\xa0 He said, “Oh we’d have to rush it.”\\xa0 He even said it was politically biased.\\xa0 He actually said that.\\xa0 The report could have been — you know who the whistleblower is, and so do you and so does everybody in this room, and so do I.\\xa0 Everybody knows.\\xa0 But they give this whistleblower a status that he doesn’t deserve.\\xa0 He’s a fake whistleblower.\\xa0 And, frankly, somebody ought to sue his ass off.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I just want to follow up, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 All right, it’s enough with the whistleblower.\\n\\nGo ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, the governor of New York today said that he is still desperate for ventilators and that he has accepted 1,000 of them from the Chinese government.\\xa0 Are you concerned that states —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, what he didn’t say is — okay, let me tell you what he didn’t say.\\n\\nTwo very good friends of mine brought him those whistleblower — brought him those ventilators, right?\\xa0 Two very good friends of mine — they brought them.\\xa0 If you’d like their name, I’ll give you their name.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But should states and cities have to rely on —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, but he — the governor didn’t —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — China and Russia for supplies?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — mention that.\\xa0 It came through the Chinese — the country of China.\\xa0 But they were given by two friends of mine, but he didn’t tell you that.\\n\\nNow, the governor also —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Who are your friends?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You’ll see when you read the letter.\\n\\nThe governor also asked for 40,000 — 40,000.\\xa0 He wanted 40,000 ventilators.\\n\\nNow, the governor, as you know, had a chance to get 16,000 a few years ago.\\xa0 He decided not to get that.\\xa0 The State of New York has asked for help.\\xa0 I’ve given him four hospitals, four medical centers.\\xa0 Then I gave him an additional hospital.\\xa0 Then I gave him military people to operate the hospital.\\xa0 They were not supposed to be COVID hospitals.\\xa0 The boat — the ship is not — an interesting thing happened with the ship.\\xa0 People aren’t in accidents because there’s nobody driving.\\xa0 There’s nobody taking motorcycle rides down the West Side Highway at 100 miles an hour.\\xa0 People are away.\\xa0 So people aren’t being injured.\\n\\nNow they’re asking whether or not we could open up the ship for COVID.\\xa0 We have given the governor of New York more than anybody has ever been given in a long time.\\xa0 I’ll just say — I was going to say “in history,” but in a long time.\\xa0 And I think he’s happy.\\n\\nBut I think that — because I watched what he said today, and it was fine.\\xa0 I wouldn’t say gracious.\\xa0 It wasn’t gracious.\\xa0 It was okay.\\xa0 I must tell you, Gavin Newsom has been gracious –Los Angeles, California, the job we’ve done, and all of California.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But why does that matter if they’re gracious or not gracious if they need the supplies?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It doesn’t matter.\\xa0 It doesn’t matter.\\xa0 But I think when we’ve given as much as we’ve given to New York, somebody should say —\\n\\nNice — I’ll tell you who’s been very nice: Mayor de Blasio has been very nice.\\xa0 He understands what we’ve given him.\\xa0 We brought him some more ventilators, too, yesterday.\\n\\nBut nobody has been given like New York.\\xa0 And I think — I know he appreciates it.\\xa0 He just can’t quite get the words out, but that’s okay.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So when he says — but when he says that he needs 40,000 —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, let me come back to Dr. Fauci’s comments on —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 To which one?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Fauci’s comments —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — on mitigation.\\xa0 On the reproductive value of the virus, the WHO had it up, I think, 2 to 2.6.\\xa0 Others had it a percentage point or two higher.\\xa0 Do we have a new number now based on those mitigation techniques?\\xa0 Have we managed to bring it down?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, Deb, I think maybe you should answer that, right?\\xa0 Dr. Birx, please?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And is the target to get below 1?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, sure — go ahead.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 You know, it’s an excellent question.\\xa0 And it’s why all of the modelers — and I really want to thank them again — they’re reevaluating all of their models in light of the level of the impact of the mitigation.\\n\\nRemember, none of us had really been through this before.\\xa0 So when we modeled school closures and distancing and staying at home, and all of these pieces, that had never really come into the model before.\\xa0 They’re working on that very diligently now.\\n\\nOf course, just to be clear, we won’t know how valid the models are until we move all the way through the epidemic.\\xa0 What we’re triangulating right now — and instead of working on R naught, we’re looking at testing and triangulating testing test- positive cases, hospitalizations, ICUs, and the whole — and, of course, the recoveries, because that’s also very important to us.\\n\\nI think it’s very important that the American people know that there are equal number of states with less than 5 percent positives despite high levels of testing.\\xa0 So there are states that are mitigating and making this work.\\xa0 There are also the states that you know of — the 18 states that have the larger outbreaks — and we’re watching them very carefully, triangulating for them all of the information to ensure that clients who come to the hospital are cared for.\\n\\nAnd then there are states in the middle that we’re trying to figure out, are they changing or not.\\xa0 Each of those states, and each of those epidemics within those states, may have a different R value.\\xa0 And that is what we’re trying to figure out.\\n\\nAnd it’s very variable on each of these factors, but the bottom line is — and I think going into this weekend, it’s really important for the American people to know this: Spain and Italy are moving through this.\\xa0 They are seeing their number of cases drop.\\xa0 They’re seeing the number of people in hospitals drop.\\xa0 We are about, on our models and on the actual data, about 12 days behind them.\\n\\nAt the same time, we see, in the United States, really good case studies of the impact at Washington State, of California, and then a series of smaller states where we’re trying to learn from them how to do surveillance.\\xa0 And with these new HHS, Abbott ID NOW kits — and I just want to thank Admiral Giroir for getting them out — being able to look at testing in a more comprehensive way so we can be doing surveillance and mitigation simultaneously so we can answer that very question.\\n\\nIt’s going to be very difficult to answer at this moment, across the United States, because each metro cluster is on a different pathway as they move through — move through the epidemic.\\xa0 And I think we just really ought to emphasize “through,” because we see Italy, we see Spain moving through.\\xa0 And we hope to be in that same position.\\n\\nAt the same time as the President said, he’s concerned about every single person that is succumbing to this virus.\\xa0 We all are.\\xa0 And that’s why we’re making sure that in this triangulation, they’re tracking minute by minute.\\xa0 When we say FEMA and HHS is tracking minute by minute the ventilator, hospital, and ICU bed need, that’s exactly what’s happening.\\n\\nAnd also being flexible and responsive.\\xa0 To have DOD take 1,000 healthcare providers out of their medical corps is a very big deal.\\xa0 I was in the medical corps for 29 years.\\xa0 We never did that.\\xa0 So this is saying we respect and understand the importance and value of the American lives and doing that.\\xa0 But the R values will be variable by state.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I just follow up?\\xa0 A week ago, we talked about a county-by-county —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Before I do that, you had breaking news last night — you know that; you saw that — where I think the probable presidential candidate for the Democrats will be Joe Biden, and he agreed that he was correct when I stopped people from China very early — very, very early — from coming into our country.\\xa0 And Dr. Fauci said that was a very big moment because it would be a much different picture we have right now had we allowed thousands and thousands of people from a specific area — I don’t have to go into it — from China, to come in highly infected.\\xa0 It would have been a very different thing.\\n\\nThe other thing — so I appreciate the fact that he did, because I was called “xenophobic,” “racist.”\\xa0 I was called many things when I did that very early.\\xa0 And I got a lot of credit for it in the Federalist.\\xa0 Because the Federalist covered the whole journey.\\xa0 And they said Trump was — I didn’t speak to the author — respected author.\\xa0 They said, “Trump was right at every single move.\\xa0 And on top of that, he was going through a fake impeachment,” a hoax.\\xa0 I was going through a hoax, when I made the decision.\\xa0 And that does take a little time and certainly a little thinking time.\\n\\nBut I appreciated the fact that Joe Biden announced last night that he now agrees that I was correct.\\xa0 You saw the report come out — that I was correct when I stopped people from China coming at a very early date.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, can we talk about the — Captain Crozier of the USS Roosevelt?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Which one?\\xa0 What?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Captain Crozier, who was removed.\\xa0 The captain who was removed as the commander of the USS Roosevelt.\\n\\nI don’t know if you saw the videos of sailors cheering for him as he left.\\xa0 Our reporting shows that some sailors have said that they are worried to reenlist because they are not convinced that commanders are taking care of their health and taking care of them.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What do you say to them?\\xa0 And does how removing —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I don’t know much about it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How does removing this captain —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I can only tell you this —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — take care of their health?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Here we have one of the greatest — here we have one of the greatest ships in the world.\\xa0 Nuclear aircraft carrier.\\xa0 Incredible ship with thousands and thousands of people.\\xa0 And you had about 120 that were infected.\\n\\nNow, I guess the captain stopped in Vietnam and people got off in Vietnam.\\xa0 Perhaps you don’t do that in the middle of a pandemic or — or something that looked like it was going to be — you know, history would say you don’t necessarily stop and let your sailors gets off, number one.\\n\\nBut more importantly, he wrote a letter.\\xa0 The letter was a five-page letter from a captain, and the letter was all over the place.\\xa0 That’s not appropriate.\\xa0 I don’t think that’s appropriate.\\xa0 And these are tough people.\\xa0 These are tough, strong people.\\n\\nI thought it looked terrible, to be honest with you.\\xa0 Now, they made their decision.\\xa0 I didn’t make the decision.\\xa0 Secretary of Defense was involved and a lot of people were involved.\\xa0 I thought it was terrible what he did to write a letter.\\xa0 I mean, this isn’t a class on literature.\\xa0 This is a captain of a massive ship that’s nuclear powered.\\xa0 And he shouldn’t be talking that way in a letter.\\xa0 He could call and ask and suggest.\\n\\nBut he stopped in Vietnam.\\xa0 A lot of people got off the boat.\\xa0 They came back and they had infection.\\xa0 And I thought it was inappropriate for the captain of a ship to do —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Were you consulted about his removal?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t want to — I don’t want to comment as to whether or not.\\xa0 But I agree with their decision 100 percent.\\n\\nIn the back, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Joe Biden actually just attacked you in a tweet.\\xa0 I don’t know if you have seen it.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He just what?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Attacked you.\\xa0 He just said that —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, he didn’t write anything.\\xa0 Look, he has people — he has professionals from the Democrats writing.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, let me just read what he said.\\xa0 He said, “Donald Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he is responsible for failing to prepare our nation to respond to it.”\\xa0 How do you respond to that, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, he didn’t write that.\\xa0 That was done by a Democrat operative.\\xa0 He doesn’t write.\\xa0 He doesn’t — he’s probably not even watching right now.\\xa0 And if he is, he doesn’t understand what he’s watching.\\n\\nBut just so you understand, it was very nice what they wrote.\\xa0 And, I don’t know — you know, they released it at a strange time.\\xa0 You know, sort of a strange time to release something like that.\\xa0 But he admitted I was right.\\n\\nAnd if you read the Federalist story, which most of you won’t because you don’t want to, but you’d learn something, because if you go — it goes to a chart, times.\\n\\nI was early.\\xa0 Dr. Fauci, I think — I don’t think he’s changed his mind, but he said it was a very important step when we stopped China from coming in from the specific area that was heavily infected.\\xa0 We’d have a whole different thing right now.\\n\\nSo I don’t really know what Joe Biden said.\\xa0 I don’t really care.\\xa0 And again, I see — every once in a while I’ll say something, I’ll make a speech, and then it’ll be critiqued and I’ll get this beautiful, brilliant critique.\\xa0 Joe Biden didn’t write that.\\xa0 Joe Biden didn’t write that.\\xa0 He wished he did, but he didn’t.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 Back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 I wanted to ask Dr. Fauci a quick question.\\xa0 China has warned of a resurgence of the virus.\\xa0 Has the U.S. developed a plan if, in fact, a second wave of the virus does, in fact, occur here in the country?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 Yes, we do.\\xa0 I mean, one of the things that obviously is parallel with thinking about the possibility, as I mentioned a little while ago, about mitigation allowing us to turn the corner very much on the front burner is what happens when we do, because the risk of there being a resurgent is real.\\n\\nSo what we need to do — and I believe I said this before but it’s worth repeating — that what we need to have in place, and we will have that in place, is that as you then pull back, you have to have the capability of, in a very pristine, precise way, do the kind of containment when you do see it.\\xa0 Because remember, when you get to mitigation, containment takes the backseat because you’re just struggling to mitigate.\\xa0 But when you get it down, you need to make sure it doesn’t resurge.\\xa0 That will require the ability to test, to identify, to isolate, and to do contact tracing.\\xa0 That’s what we have to have in place, and hopefully we will at the time that we then pull back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A question for Dr. Hahn from the FDA.\\xa0 You mentioned the plasma, sir.\\xa0 So these are — this is plasma that were infected, that now either recovered or are doing well enough, and then they’re transferring it to — is it family members?\\xa0 Can you walk us through — that’s working as, kind of, like a case-by-case basis to certain hospitals?\\xa0 What are the results from that?\\xa0 I was just not familiar with that one.\\n\\nDR. HAHN:\\xa0 So, this is a situation where someone who’s recovered from the virus and doesn’t have the virus in their system at all, you can take plasma — and this is a pretty routine procedure.\\xa0 You can actually donate a couple times a week, a couple times of month, frankly, and give that plasma.\\xa0 And that plasma contains the proteins in the blood that have the antibodies against the virus.\\xa0 You can take that, process it, and then give it to someone who’s ill.\\xa0 And so that allows you to transfer that immunity.\\xa0 It doesn’t have to be matched by family or anything like that.\\n\\nSince last Tuesday — the Tuesday before last — we’ve allowed academic centers and other laboratories and hospitals around the country to do this on a compassionate-use basis.\\n\\nWhat we did was we pulled this together in what’s called an Expanded Access Program and run it through the Red Cross because they’ve got the greatest system and capacity for doing this.\\xa0 And this allows us to scale up so that when people get sick, we can actually have these donated plasma packs given to the patients who are sick.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0 So are people — do people need to be donating plasma? Obviously, some of us don’t know if we’ve had it or recovered.\\xa0 I mean, what should people be doing?\\n\\nDR. HAHN:\\xa0 So, we’ve started with the Red Cross in this program.\\xa0 We made an announcement yesterday.\\xa0 We are planning to actually scale that up, and we’ll have more information this week.\\xa0 Because we want to make sure we have the systems in place.\\xa0 It’s a superb question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 All right, Jeff, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, can you clarify the situation with 3M right now?\\xa0 Germany said that it was an act of piracy that 200,000 masks were apparently diverted from Thailand to the United States, instead of to Berlin.\\xa0 Is that a miscommunication?\\xa0 Did that actually happen?\\xa0 And should 3M be fulfilling contracts for masks to other countries?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re very disappointed in 3M.\\xa0 They should be taking care of our country.\\xa0 And they can sell to others, but they should be taking care of our country.\\n\\nThe people that have dealt with them have dealt successfully with many companies over the last month.\\xa0 They don’t like the way 3M has treated our country.\\xa0 They don’t, frankly, like the representatives of 3M.\\xa0 And no act of pir- — you said piracy, right?\\xa0 Piracy?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 For Germans — the German order.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 There’s been no act of piracy.\\xa0 No, there’s been no act of piracy.\\xa0 It’s the opposite.\\xa0 3M has not treated our country well.\\xa0 And if they do, great.\\xa0 And if they don’t, they’re going to have a hell of a price to pay.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But the German order —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I say it that way.\\xa0 And I watched him on television, on something, talking about how “this is so hard to believe, so hard to fathom.”\\xa0 They ought to get their act together.\\xa0 Because I got involved and I looked at what happened, and they have not — 3M has not treated our country well.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can you just clarify about that German order though?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Was that diverted, sir, or was that not diverted?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’ll get you the information.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And can I ask one for Dr. Fauci?\\xa0 I was wondering about what you’re seeing as far as lupus patients, in regards to coronavirus.\\xa0 I know the President mentioned this earlier, but what does the medicine say?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 What is the question?\\xa0 Is that, “What is the incidence of coronavirus?”\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, I mean, if you lupus, do you have —\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — a greater chance of getting coronavirus or —\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 There is — right now, this is being looked at in a natural history study.\\xa0 We don’t have any definitive information to be able to make any comment that that — it’s an obvious good question, because it might be a way for us to get some interesting and potentially important data as to the role of those medications.\\xa0 But that’s something that is now being looked at, but we don’t have any data to be able to say anything definitively.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And I hope they use the hydroxychloroquine, and they can also do it with Z-Pak, subject to your doctor’s approval, and all of that.\\xa0 But I hope they use it because I’ll tell you what: What do you have to lose?\\xa0 In some cases, they’re in bad shape.\\xa0 What do you have to lose?\\xa0 It’s been out there for a long time, and I hope they use it.\\xa0 And they’re going to look at the — with doctors.\\xa0 Work with doctors.\\xa0 Get what you have to get.\\xa0 But we have it stockpiled, and it’s — we have a lot of it, and we’re getting more of it.\\n\\nAnd as I told you, I spoke to Prime Minister Modi.\\xa0 We’re getting more of it, but we have a lot of it.\\xa0 And I hope they use it, because it’s been used for a long time and therefore it’s passed the safety test.\\xa0 FDA has been terrific.\\xa0 Dr. Hahn, I appreciate it very much, too.\\xa0 But I’ve seen some results.\\n\\nNow, it’s early, I guess. \\xa0It’s early.\\xa0 But — and you should — they should look at the lupus thing.\\xa0 I don’t know what it says, but there’s a rumor out there that — because it takes care of lupus very effectively, as I understand it.\\xa0 It’s a, you know, a drug that’s used for lupus.\\n\\nSo there’s a study out there that says people that have lupus haven’t been catching this virus.\\xa0 You know, maybe it’s true, maybe it’s not.\\xa0 Why don’t you investigate that?\\n\\nAnd there’s also other studies, you know, with the malaria, that the malaria countries have very little — people that take this drug for malaria, which is very effective for malaria — that those countries have very little of this virus.\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 You’re going to check it out.\\n\\nBut I think people should — if it were me — in fact, I might do it anyway.\\xa0 I may take it.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 I may take it.\\xa0 And I’ll have to ask my doctors about that, but I may take it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, please go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, last week, the last couple of days, you’ve been really optimistic about Russia and Saudi Arabia coming together on a deal on oil.\\xa0 But in the last 24 hours, the OPEC-plus meeting has been pushed back.\\xa0 They’ve traded some really critical statements.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, OPEC can do whatever — look, I’ve been against OPEC all my life, because what is it?\\xa0 It’s an illegal — you could call it a cartel, you could call it a monopoly.\\xa0 You have a lot of different names for it.\\xa0 But it broke down very violently.\\xa0 Very violently.\\n\\nSo I don’t care about OPEC.\\xa0 I really don’t.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you’re not —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0 I couldn’t care less about OPEC.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you’re not less optimistic about —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Let me just say —\\xa0no, no.\\xa0 I think they’re going to settle it.\\xa0 You know why?\\xa0 Because they’re going to be destroyed.\\xa0 They’re destroying themselves if they don’t.\\n\\nRussia — it’s a very important — and we had a very good conversation, President Putin and myself.\\xa0 Very good.\\xa0 But Russia — a big part of their economic wellbeing is from oil.\\xa0 Well, oil is at a record low.\\xa0 Nobody has ever seen anything like it.\\xa0 It’s actually lower than you even think.\\xa0 And it’s to their advantage.\\xa0 Obviously, it’s to Saudi Arabia’s advantage.\\n\\nThey told me they’re discussing.\\xa0 Saudi Arabia went much further than that.\\xa0 He thinks that a deal is going to be made at 10 million barrels reduction, and maybe more than that.\\xa0 He actually indicated it would most likely be much more than that.\\xa0 So we’ll see what happens.\\xa0 I mean, we’re going to see what happens.\\n\\nBut as far as OPEC is concerned, I mean, I was against OPEC for years and years because I thought it was very unfair to our country.\\xa0 The beautiful thing is we have built one of the great — you know, one of the things we’ve done is created so much.\\xa0 We — we produce.\\xa0 We’re the number one producer in the world right now.\\xa0 I don’t like it for a different reason: because it’s going to hurt a lot of jobs in our country, this price.\\xa0 It’s going to hurt a lot of jobs.\\n\\nNow, with all of that being said, people are going to be driving, paying 90 cents a gallon.\\xa0 Did you ever hear of that?\\xa0 What’s that, 1952 or something?\\xa0 All right?\\n\\nSo from that standpoint — but you know what?\\xa0 I am a big believer in our great energy business, and we’re going to take care of our energy business.\\xa0 And if I have to do tariffs on oil coming from outside, or if I have to do something to protect — or thousands and tens of thousands of energy workers, and our great companies that produce all these jobs — I’ll do whatever I have to do.\\n\\nOkay, yeah, ma’am.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 You tweeted a little while ago about how sad it is for kids, they don’t have little league right now.\\xa0 But I’m wondering if you’re willing to share about your youngest son and how he’s dealing with life, and sheltering in place, not going to school, no sports.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, he’s a good athlete, and he loves soccer.\\xa0 And he — he’s like everyone else.\\xa0 I mean, everything shut down.\\xa0 He’s in his room.\\xa0 He’s happy, but he’s not as happy as you could be.\\xa0 He’d like to be playing sports.\\xa0 Barron.\\n\\nAnd let’s see what happens.\\xa0 But we have to get back.\\xa0 We have to get back.\\xa0 Remember that.\\xa0 We have to get back, and we have to get back soon.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, on the jobs report numbers —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Do you guys ever stop?\\xa0 Do you want to keep going for a little while?\\xa0 Huh?\\xa0 I mean, do you ever stop?\\xa0 How many times do you ask — and in many cases, it’s the same — actually, a lot of good questions.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 In the jobs report —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But keep going?\\xa0 Yes?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\xa0 This is what we do.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So you’re not going to blame me that I kept it going too long?\\xa0 People said, “Oh, he kept…”\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s Saturday, yeah.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 I mean, no, it’s amazing.\\xa0 I’m telling you, every hand went up.\\xa0 I thought we’ve gone through — and they’re all — every —\\n\\nI think every single hand went up the last time.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 We’ve got nowhere else to go.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You know what it shows you?\\xa0 It shows you that you love what you do.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 We do love what we do, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You do.\\xa0 No, you do.\\xa0 And some of you do it well.\\xa0 Not all of you.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No offense taken.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m not looking at you, by the way.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So we did get the jobs reports numbers yesterday.\\xa0 Obviously, that’s kind of a small portion because it’s only the first half of March.\\xa0 Was there anything in there that was any sign of optimism?\\xa0 I mean, obviously, we all saw the numbers, you know, down at retail, down in hospitality.\\xa0 Was there anything that you said, “Okay, maybe with this virus we will see some sort of net gain in jobs”?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Look, the job numbers are what they are.\\xa0 We asked everybody to go home, don’t work.\\xa0 So the numbers are going to be, you know, astronomical.\\xa0 We understand that.\\xa0 I understood that.\\n\\nI know somebody said that the numbers are meaningless, and then they took that to mean, “Oh, jobs don’t mean anything.”\\xa0 And, you know, it was just another fake news story.\\xa0 It wasn’t me that said it, by the way.\\xa0 It was a very smart person.\\xa0 But they meant it by saying it really is what — that’s why I answer your question very carefully.\\xa0 The numbers are what they are.\\xa0 We know the numbers were going to be massive, because we told everybody to go home and lock your door, essentially.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 “Don’t come to work.\\xa0 You can’t come to work.\\xa0 Don’t go outside.\\xa0 Don’t breathe.\\xa0 Don’t do anything.”\\n\\nWe got to open up our country.\\xa0 But I know — I know that it’s coming back.\\xa0 And in my opinion, it will come back very strong.\\xa0 There’s a tremendous energy.\\xa0 There’s a tremendous demand.\\xa0 And some good things have happened.\\n\\nI mean — I don’t know.\\xa0 You know, there’s one habit that, as you know, most of you — and a lot of you have covered me a long time before I did this — I was never a big believer in shaking hands.\\xa0 But I decided, if you don’t shake hands, you’re not going to be winning a lot of contests.\\xa0 Right now, I’m not sure you have to shake hands anymore.\\n\\nA couple of people have told me — Deborah, you told me that if we didn’t shake hands, the incidence of flu — flu is a big deal also — and that flu might be cut down in half.\\xa0 Who knew that shaking hands was such a bad thing?\\xa0 I felt it.\\xa0 I mean, I always felt it.\\xa0 And, you know, I was never to a point where I can’t shake somebody’s hand.\\xa0 I knew people like that too.\\xa0 But there aren’t too many of them.\\n\\nBut when I ran for office, all of a sudden, I’m shaking hundreds of hands.\\xa0 And if I don’t, I wouldn’t even be standing here.\\xa0 But I think that’s a custom that maybe people don’t have to.\\xa0 We have to get close together, we have to sit together at the stadiums, we have to sit next to each other in restaurants.\\xa0 All that stuff is going to happen, but I think the concept of shaking hands maybe is something that’s going to be a little bit from the past.\\xa0 Let’s see what happens.\\xa0 Maybe they’ll go right back to shaking hands.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And my last question for the day.\\xa0 How about that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is there anything you want people to do to show their support, especially — we have two doctors up there — to show their support for the medical community?\\xa0 Is there something that — we’ve seen people clapping when nurses leave.\\xa0 I’ve seen people make —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’ve seen a lot of that.\\xa0 You might say something there.\\xa0 I have seen such support.\\xa0 I saw this morning where everyone — they’re clapping for fire department, they’re clapping for police.\\xa0 But they are really going — these people are —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What should people do?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You know what they’re like?\\xa0 They’re like — Tony, they’re like warriors.\\xa0 Mike, they’re like warriors.\\xa0 They were going into Elmhurst Hospital, which has been tragic — right near where I grew up, in Queens — going in.\\xa0 And the people in buildings — there’s — going.\\xa0 I mean, they’re the rockstars.\\xa0 They’re warriors.\\xa0 Nurses, doctors, first responders, what they’re — what they’re going through.\\n\\nAnd they don’t even know what’s going to happen.\\xa0 I mean, they go in.\\xa0 And, by the way, even if they have great equipment they’re catching it.\\xa0 You know, great equipment.\\xa0 They have good equipment, they catch it.\\xa0 They catch it with good, with bad.\\xa0 It is evil.\\n\\nBut, Tony, you might say something.\\xa0 And, Mike, you may say something about that.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 I’m glad you brought up that question because I don’t think people can really fully appreciate\\xa0the extraordinary effort of these people.\\xa0 I mean, it’s — it’s amazing.\\n\\nI — you know, I did all of my medical training in New York City, in a big, busy New York City hospital, at a time when it was just what you normally see in a hospital.\\xa0 I came to NIH and I spent about five to eight years in the very early years of the AIDS epidemic — which was just the darkest years of my life because almost every single one of my patients died.\\n\\nAnd yet, as we knew epidemiologically that there was very little risk — there was a small risk, but very little risk of getting infected from a patient, to see now what these brave warriors are doing in the hospitals, not only giving lifesaving treatment to people, but every single day putting themselves at risk for themselves and their family — I just think that the American public owe a phenomenal debt of gratitude for these people.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How do you want them show that?\\xa0 What would you —\\n\\nDR.\\xa0FAUCI:\\xa0 And they should just salute them at every — every ways you can.\\xa0 You know, when we were at war — at the height of the war in Afghanistan, in Iraq — when you’re at an airport and you’d see somebody with a uniform come by, everybody would do that. (Claps.)\\xa0 I think that’s what we should do when we see healthcare workers.\\xa0 Just applaud them.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Pretty much what’s happening.\\n\\nMike, please.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The stories are incredibly moving about what healthcare workers are doing every day.\\xa0 It’s not just that they’re going back into the hospital in places like New York and New Jersey, and earlier than that, in Washington State and California, where this first began.\\xa0 It’s not just that they’re providing care to people.\\xa0 But because of the nature of how contagious the coronavirus is, they’re also supplementing for family.\\n\\nI mean, that’s what — that’s what gets to me when I hear the stories that, understandably, in nursing homes and in hospitals they’re restricting visitors — and they should — to prevent the spread of the virus to be brought into the hospital or to be brought out.\\n\\nAnd so to hear the stories of healthcare workers who are holding up an iPhone while someone who’s critically ill with the coronavirus may well be saying their last goodbyes to their family, and then to be there in those moments — I mean, our healthcare workers are — they’re not just doctors and nurses today, they — they’re supplementing for family, for people all across the country.\\n\\nAnd I just think — you know, tomorrow is Palm Sunday.\\xa0 It’s Holy Week in the great Christian tradition.\\xa0 And I have people ask me, from time to time — send me an email, or on the many conference calls we have — they said, “What can we be praying about?”\\xa0 And my first thought is with the families who have lost loved ones and the patients who are struggling with coronavirus.\\xa0 But during this very special week, I just encourage people to pray for our healthcare workers.\\xa0 Pray for them and their families.\\xa0 They are really the hands and feet every day, not just of healthcare, but of the heart of the American people.\\xa0 And we are all grateful for them every hour of the day.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And think also about the Army Corps of Engineers.\\xa0 Now, it’s a little different, depending on where they are and where they’re working.\\xa0 But the Army Corps of Eng- — throwing up a hospital in New York City: 2,500 beds in three days?\\xa0 I mean, think of that.\\xa0 And FEMA, what they’re doing.\\xa0 And the National Guard is now delivering for the state because the state were unable to get — we’d drop it at a big warehouse where we’re told to drop it, and the states were unable — some of the states were unable to bring it from the warehouse to the site.\\n\\nSo we got the National Guard to become a delivery service, if you can believe it, and they would bring it.\\xa0 And some of those sites were dangerous sites.\\xa0 They were very dangerous sites.\\xa0 Think of that.\\xa0 It’s been amazing.\\xa0 It’s been amazing.\\n\\nI just think — I’ve never seen anything like it.\\xa0 I’m so proud of this country.\\xa0 And, really, it’s a world problem and some countries in the world are just handling it so well.\\n\\nYou know, again, I keep saying it: It’s 151.\\xa0 That was as of two, three days ago.\\xa0 It’s probably more.\\xa0 Some people said they didn’t know there were that many countries.\\xa0 That’s how big this is.\\n\\nAnd Mike said something also.\\xa0 You have Palm Sunday tomorrow.\\xa0 Think of it.\\xa0 We’re not going to churches on Palm Sunday.\\xa0 But think of next Sunday: Easter.\\xa0 And I brought it up before: I said, maybe we could allow special for churches.\\xa0 Maybe we could talk about it.\\xa0 Maybe we could allow them, with great separation, outside on Easter Sunday.\\xa0 I don’t know, it’s something we should talk about.\\n\\nBut somebody did say that, well, then you’re sort of opening it up to that little — you know, do we want to take a chance on doing that when we’ve been doing so well.\\n\\nBut Easter Sunday, Palm Sunday.\\xa0 I’m going to be watching tomorrow live from Riverside, California — a great church.\\xa0 But I’m going to be watching on a computer.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 On a laptop.\\xa0 I think, on Easter, maybe I’ll be watching from a laptop as opposed —\\n\\nSo how sad is it that we have Easter Palm and Easter Sunday, and people are watching on laptops and computers?\\xa0 It’s sad.\\n\\nBut — but the job that this whole country has done is amazing.\\xa0 But I’ll say this: Our medical professionals, what they’ve done, because they are — they walk into those hospitals; you see them putting on their gear and they’re putting it on as they’re walking through the front doors.\\xa0 And some of those people are going to die.\\xa0 They’re going to die.\\xa0 You know, it’s, like, incredible.\\n\\nAnd we can say what we want, Tony and Deb, about young and medium-aged.\\xa0 There are plenty of those people dying too.\\xa0 You know, it’s — it generally hits the older people where they have problems.\\xa0 It hits young people too, and it hits middle-aged people too.\\n\\nBut these people are walking into hospitals, and they watch — I can’t — I think it’s — it’s incredible.\\xa0 And they’re putting their outfit, they’re getting it ready.\\xa0 And they’re going in.\\xa0 They’re going — it’s like — it’s like a — it’s like a war.\\n\\nAgain, there’s never been anything so contagious as this.\\xa0 In 1917, it was vicious if you got it, but it wasn’t contagious like this.\\n\\nNow, in 1917, had they had the Internet and all the means of communication, they could have practiced distancing.\\xa0 You know, by the time, people started thinking in terms — in those terms, they lost, I guess, 75 to 100 million people.\\xa0 So that’s modern — you know, that’s a modern day, great thing that happened.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, just on antibodies: To what extent do you think that you can use antibody tests to determine who can go back to work and how —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I don’t know.\\xa0 I’d rather leave that to the doctor.\\xa0 Doctor, do you have an answer to that?\\n\\nDR. HAHN:\\xa0 We think it’ll be a tool to help us get people back to work.\\xa0 It’ll be additional information.\\xa0 Because, as you know, if you have an antibody, that means you were exposed and have recovered from it.\\xa0 That, with the information about diagnosis, should help.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But how quickly can you scale up this testing to determine on a large scale how many people can go back to work and have this antibodies?\\n\\nDR. HAHN:\\xa0 So, as you know, a couple weeks ago, we provided a great deal of regulatory flexibility around this.\\xa0 A lot of great developers have been working on this.\\xa0 Dr. Birx put a call out to the academic labs around the country to do this.\\xa0 And we’ve been working very closely with a number of manufacturers.\\xa0 So we think that it can be scaled up relatively quickly.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, a question for Dr. Fauci.\\xa0 In a recent interview, you had said that you knew the 15-day guidance would not be enough.\\xa0 I wanted to ask your confidence level about the 30-day guidance and whether it’ll be enough.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 You know, it’s tough to talk about levels of confidence, but I can tell you one thing that I feel strongly: that if we do in a very proactive way what I said in my opening comments, and people literally across the country, as a baseline, have that physical separation — and as we’ve mentioned up here, there’ll be varying degrees of that depending upon whether you’re in New York City or you’re in a place that’s less.\\xa0 But every place, everybody, should be doing some degree of this physical separation.\\xa0 If we do that, again, I have confidence that what we will see is the turning around of the curve.\\xa0 Whether or not it’ll be all the way down, what we want, it’s impossible to say.\\xa0 I would be — I would be foolish to say that.\\n\\nBut the one thing I am confident in — so let’s take this to the bank: that mitigation works.\\xa0 So, it does.\\xa0 We’ve seen it in other countries.\\xa0 We’ve seen it in our own country.\\xa0 And that’s the reason why I keep coming up at every chance I get to plea with the American people to please take a look at those guidelines that the Vice President keeps putting up with his chart, because every single one of those points has something to do with physical separation.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And mitigation does work.\\xa0 But again, we’re not going to destroy our country.\\xa0 We have to get back.\\xa0 Because, you know, at a certain point, you’ll lose more people this way — through all of the problems caused — than you will with what we’re doing right now.\\xa0 What we’re doing right now, I think it’s going to be very successful.\\xa0 But you know what?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So if the corona- —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 We’re going to — we have a big decision to make at a certain point.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 We have a big decision to make.\\xa0 We went this extra period of time.\\n\\nBut I’ve said it from the beginning: The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself.\\xa0 And we cannot let that happen.\\xa0 We have an incredible country.\\xa0 We were having the greatest period in our country’s history, from an economic standpoint and many other ways.\\xa0 We cannot let this continue.\\n\\nSo at a certain point, some hard decisions are going to have to be made.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, ventilator manufacturers are doubling, tripling, even quadrupling their production, in some cases.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s true.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And yet, medical experts and some of these manufacturers are predicting that there will still be shortages of tens of thousands of ventilators.\\xa0 Is it time for you to level with the American public that there likely will be shortages of ventilators in some cases?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Could be.\\xa0 I mean, it could be you have shortages, and it could also be that you have some that have way overestimated the number of ventilators they need.\\n\\nWe think that — you know, we have a good — a good amount ready to move.\\xa0 I mean, literally, like an army, they’re ready to move to any hotspot.\\xa0 But some of the ones that you’re talking about — always a nasty question from CNN — but some of the ones.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Why is it a nasty question?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Because I think that, frankly, you know —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Shouldn’t Americans know whether there’s going to be shortages?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Because you know what?\\xa0 You’ve asked that question about 10 times over the course of about a month.\\n\\nLook, we’re mobilized and ready to go.\\xa0 We have a lot of ventilators ready to go.\\xa0 And if we had given them all out, we wouldn’t, and you would be overstocked in many areas.\\n\\nWhat we’re doing is we have a very good plan to take from some areas, even though we have the 10, or almost the 10,000.\\xa0 We’re also taking from areas that won’t be as badly hit as today we think they will be.\\xa0 There will be some areas hit harder than we think.\\xa0 And there’s nothing that Deborah or Tony or any of these professionals can do about it.\\n\\nThis thing moves in a lot of ways.\\xa0 But what we’re going to do is we are going to have — and if you look at us compared to a lot of other countries, we’re in much better shape.\\xa0 But these professionals have done an amazing job.\\n\\nNow, over the next week and two weeks — this is going to be a very, very deadly period, unfortunately — but we’re going to make it so that we lose as few lives as possible.\\xa0 And I think we’re going to be successful.\\xa0 I think we already are successful in that regard.\\n\\nWhen you look at that graph and you see all of the — the “bumps,” if you want to call it, at a very low level, and you see a couple at a higher level — they were tough — but you see all of those levels.\\xa0 You know, when you look in — and when you hear about Italy and then you hear about France and then you hear about — you know, what we have is we have many Italys all over. \\xa0We have — they’re like countries.\\xa0 California is a country; New York is a country — if you look at them from the standpoint of what we’re talking about.\\n\\nWe have many, like, country spots.\\xa0 Some are hotspots and there’s nothing we’re going to do about it.\\xa0 One of the biggest surprises is Louisiana because it started off so good, and then all of a sudden, it shot up like a rocket.\\xa0 But we are going to try and have ventilators wherever we possibly can.\\n\\nJeff, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But it seems like despite the Herculean effort of some of these companies to ramp up production as fast as possible —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — it still won’t be enough.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, New York wanted 40,000 ventilators, okay?\\xa0 Forty thousand.\\xa0 Think of what 40,000 is.\\xa0 It’s like cars.\\xa0 It’s a big project.\\xa0 It’s an expensive product.\\xa0 I mean, some of them are $50,000 apiece.\\xa0 I saw one the other day: 55,000.\\xa0 That was before they start playing the games with supply and demand, okay?\\xa0 Some are very, very — you call them “luxury.”\\xa0 Some are not.\\n\\nBut, frankly, these are very expensive products.\\xa0 These are very high-tech projects and products, and they take a period of time.\\xa0 We have thousands of them being built right now.\\xa0 Some will be ready.\\xa0 And we’re going to have extra, and we’ll keep them at hospitals.\\xa0 But a lot of hospitals, a lot of states had the chance of getting ventilators, and they turned those ventilators down for — so they could spend their money on something else.\\n\\nAnd in a way, I understand that because who thinks a thing like this — it’s not a knock.\\xa0 If I’m told — like, perhaps New York — you can spend a billion dollars on ventilators and get 16,000 or a massive number of ventilators that they’ve been offered over the years, or you can build a new bridge or road or something.\\xa0 I mean, I understand how that works.\\xa0 I’m not blaming anybody.\\xa0 I’m just saying they — a lot of the states had chances of stockpiling a lot of ventilators.\\xa0 They didn’t do it.\\xa0 And I think we’re doing a very good job in helping them out.\\n\\nPlease, Jeff.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And it’s a very fair question.\\xa0 I understand that question very well.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To follow up on what you and the others have been saying today about it being a deadly week or two coming: Can you give us a sense, or perhaps Dr. Birx, of what that means, numerically?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 I’d like to ask also.\\xa0 Yeah, I’d like to say we know pretty much the line of attack.\\xa0 We know the numbers.\\xa0 The numbers are the numbers.\\xa0 They seem to be checking out, unfortunately.\\xa0 Or in some cases, you know, they’re on the low side, which we’re very happy.\\xa0 We want to keep them on the very low side, and that’s where we’re headed.\\xa0 And I think that’s maybe where we’re headed.\\n\\nBut I’d like to ask maybe you and Tony, what are — where is the — where is the week or the number of days of greatest attack?\\xa0 What will be our worst day?\\xa0 If that’s possible to determine.\\xa0 I think that’s what you’re asking, right?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And how many deaths exactly are you expecting?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So as you can look in the places that are the most difficult hit right now — the Detroit area, the New York area, the Louisiana area — and we are doing it by the counties in those states because there are — mostly, it’s metro areas and the bedroom communities around those metro areas, because people went to work and got exposed, and came home and exposed other.\\n\\nIf you look out in New York now, you see that it’s in Long Island and it’s out in Suffolk County and Nassau County.\\n\\nAll of those counties, Wayne and Oakland, they’re all on the upside of their curve of mortality.\\xa0 So you know when you get to the peak, you come down the other side.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And when will that peak be?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So by the predictions that are in that Healthdata.org, they’re predicting in those three hotspots, all of them, hitting together in the next six to seven days.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So are you thinking maybe tens of thousands of deaths in that period of time?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 You can go to the website.\\xa0 It’s variable.\\xa0 Each one of those communities is different.\\xa0 But you know where New York is, how much their mortality has been.\\xa0 And you know — what we’re seeing today are the people who were infected two or three weeks ago.\\n\\nIf mitigation in New York worked — and we believe it is working — the cases are going to start to go down, but the mortality will be a lag behind that because of the comorbidities and other conditions.\\n\\nSo that’s why all of the predictions are that this next week — and I think we said this last Sunday when we talked about the charts — and it’s difficult, and we tried to prepare the American people to understand that you have to — as much as you go up, you have to come down the other side, because coming down is a reflection of the cases that were coming in before.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Would you rather not say a number?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 I’d rather not say a number, but the numbers are available if you go to the website.\\xa0 I mean, you can see that there’s several hundreds per day in New York.\\xa0 And I think Governor Cuomo has talked about that increasing still into the five, six, seven hundred range a day.\\xa0 So, you know, that’s very concerning to us.\\n\\nWe, again, applaud the healthcare workers who are doing every single thing humanly possible to save more lives.\\xa0 And we are ensuring on a ventilator by ventilator, day by day, to get them there so that we can say and we can be there when they need it, because we are supposed to be that group that comes in after all of the resources are exhausted.\\n\\nAnd we really applaud what Oregon did, and we really applaud what the governor is doing about moving between the states, between the different counties, to bring them to New York, because that’s what’s needed today.\\xa0 A different place will be needed tomorrow.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You mentioned — just to follow up on something apparently you said yesterday, that you had some concerns about Pennsylvania, Colorado, and Washington, D.C.\\xa0 Could you expand on that?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 We’re watching them because they are starting to go on that upside of the curve.\\xa0 We’re hoping and believing that if people mitigate strongly, the work that they did over the last two weeks will blunt that curve and they won’t have the same upward slope and peak that New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and part of Rhode Island are having.\\n\\nSo this is a very important — the next two weeks are extraordinarily important, and that’s why I think you’ve heard from Dr. Fauci, from myself, from the President, and the Vice President that this is the moment to do everything that you can on the presidential guidelines.\\xa0 This is the moment to not be going to the grocery store, not be going to the pharmacy, but doing everything you can to keep your family and your friends safe.\\xa0 And that means everybody doing the six-feet distancing, washing your hands.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good.\\xa0 Thanks.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Doctor?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Doctor, you want to —\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 So, I mean, ditto to everything that Dr. Birx said, but also to emphasize why it’s so important to do that: because we’re looking at three or four really key hotspots that are still going up.\\xa0 It’s absolutely essential that the ones that are down at that lower level that Dr. Birx showed the other day — those communities where they’re still going up — we’ve got to make sure we don’t have multiple waves of peaks.\\n\\nThat’s going to be the answer to the question of when we can start pulling back.\\xa0 Because if you keep having multiple peaks and different waves, that’s going to make it very difficult.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So does more need to be done —\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 No, I mean —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — to make sure those areas are doing it?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Put your foot on the — exactly what I said just before and I keep repeating: Just make sure everybody does at least the minimal amount of that physical separation, because the virus has no place to go if you’re physically separated.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And one of the reasons that I keep talking about hydroxychloroquine is that the question that nobody ever asks, and the question that I most hate the answer to, is: “What happens if you do have a ventilator?\\xa0 What are your chances?”\\n\\nAnd I just hope that hydroxychloroquine wins, coupled with perhaps the Z-Pak, as we call it — dependent totally on your doctors and the doctors there — because you know the answer to that question.\\xa0 If you do have the ventilator, you know the answer to that question.\\xa0 And I hate giving the answer.\\n\\nSo I don’t want to get them there.\\xa0 I don’t want to get them there.\\xa0 There’s a possibility — a possibility — and I say it: What do you have to lose?\\xa0 I’ll say it again: What do you have to lose?\\xa0 Take it.\\xa0 I really think they should take it.\\xa0 But it’s their choice and it’s their doctor’s choice, or the doctors in the hospital.\\xa0 But hydroxychloroquine — try it, if you’d like.\\n\\nThe other thing: If you have a heart condition, I understand.\\xa0 Probably you stay away from the Z-Pak.\\xa0 But that’s an antibiotic.\\xa0 It can clean out the lungs.\\xa0 The lungs are a point of attack for this horrible virus.\\n\\nBut when you have a ventilator, don’t ask the answer because I hate it.\\xa0 If you have it, and it’s working beautifully — I don’t like the answer, because it’s not a very high percentage.\\n\\nSo I want to keep them out of ventilators.\\xa0 I want to keep them — if this drug works, it will be not a game changer, because that’s not a nice enough term; it will be wonderful.\\xa0 It’ll be so beautiful.\\xa0 It’ll be a gift from heaven if it works.\\xa0 Because when people go into those ventilators, you know the answers, I know the answers, and I’m glad you don’t write about it.\\n\\nMike, please.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, you’ve heard from the experts what our task force has heard: that it’s going to be a difficult week for the American people.\\xa0 You will see testing increased around the country and so cases are going to continue to rise across America.\\n\\nAnd before I give a few facts relevant to an earlier question about ventilators, let me just — let me add my voice to what the President just said and what all the physicians who have spoken have said: Even though we see the losses rising in the days ahead, do not be discouraged, because there is evidence across the country that Americans have been putting the social distancing and mitigation into practice, and it is making a difference.\\xa0 We are seeing it in the new cases that are being reported.\\n\\nBecause remember, people, families that have experienced loss — up to this day and in the next week — have a loved one who contracted the coronavirus, in most cases, more than two weeks ago; in many cases, before social distancing and mitigation efforts were put into effect.\\n\\nAnd so we want to encourage you: Believe in the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America.\\xa0 Go to Coronavirus.gov.\\xa0 Print them off again, put them on the refrigerator, and remind yourself to put them into practice.\\n\\nOn the subject of ventilators, if I can amplify the point the President made: Our team at FEMA is doing a remarkable job working with governors, state health officials, and local hospitals, particularly focused on our priority areas.\\xa0 We’ll refer to the New York metro area, which includes New Jersey and Connecticut.\\xa0 We’re focused on the New Orleans metro area and Louisiana.\\xa0 We’re focusing on Detroit, we’re focusing on Chicago.\\xa0 These are the areas where we see the significant rise in cases.\\n\\nAnd we are surging supplies — specifically ventilators, but all personal protective equipment — from FEMA to those areas.\\xa0 And just to give you a couple of examples: I spoke to governors in New York, New Jersey, Louisiana, Massachusetts Michigan, and Maryland today, alone.\\xa0 And in those cases, Governor Cuomo is actually assessing all of the available ventilators.\\n\\nWe’ve sent 4,400 ventilators already to New York.\\xa0 As has already been referenced, they’re going to receive a shipment of over 1,000 from overseas.\\xa0 And allow me to say as I told her personally today, the governor of Oregon, Governor Kate Brown: Her unilateral decision to send 140 ventilators because Oregon — they felt Oregon today is in a place where they could give those ventilators to New York, to me was in the very highest American tradition of loving your neighbor.\\n\\nAnd when I talked to Governor Cuomo, Mr. President, he actually told me they never asked Oregon for the ventilators, and Governor Brown hadn’t even called him to tell him that she was doing that.\\xa0 It really is remarkable.\\n\\nAnd I talked to Governor Hogan today — and the President and I will be speaking to all of America’s governors on Monday again — I told him how inspired I was and how he ought to spread the word to other governors in areas where they can — where they can spare resources to be joining with us at the federal level and providing them to states at the point of the need.\\n\\nBut just a few for-instances: As we track New Jersey, as I told Governor Phil Murphy, we deployed 200 ventilators to New Jersey today.\\n\\nLouisiana — where we’re monitoring literally hour by hour what’s taking place in New Orleans with some encouraging news, but still great challenges — yesterday, you heard the President say that we deployed 330,000 gowns that have been delivered to the public health systems and hospitals there, and 200 ventilators.\\n\\nI spoke to Governor Charlie Baker today and was able to inform him we’re watching Boston area very closely.\\xa0 A hundred ventilators are deploying today.\\n\\nI spoke to Governor Gretchen Whitmer today.\\xa0 Detroit is experiencing a significant number of cases.\\xa0 We’re watching it carefully.\\xa0 And today, FEMA directed 300 ventilators to Michigan.\\n\\nAgain, as the President said, we’re all working our hearts out.\\xa0 But what I want to say to American families and what I want to say to healthcare workers is that we are going to identify the resources, leave no stone unturned, and we are going to — we are going to focus resources on those areas in the order that they emerge.\\n\\nNow, the last thought is — back on mitigation — we are hoping that we do not see other major cities in the country experience what Seattle experienced, what a Greater New York City area is experiencing, what the New Orleans is experiencing.\\xa0 And that’s all in the hands of the American people today.\\n\\nAnd so I just want to encourage you, again: Coronavirus.gov.\\xa0 Put into practice the President’s coronavirus guidelines and you will do your part to save lives, protect the American people, and ensure that we will have the resources to meet this moment wherever the need should arise.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you spoke earlier on the SBA’s loan program that got up and running yesterday.\\xa0 But we’re hearing from a lot of small-business owners a lot of concerns about whether they will get this money.\\xa0 Some say some of the banks weren’t ready to start processing loans.\\xa0 Some banks are layering —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s so false.\\xa0 We’re way ahead of schedules.\\xa0 The banks have been great.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Some banks are layering extra restrictions on people.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 JPMorgan Chase.\\xa0 Bank of America.\\xa0 They’re so far ahead.\\xa0 This is typical with you, in particular.\\xa0 “We hear they’re behind…”\\xa0 They’re not behind.\\xa0 It’s been a flawless — it’s been flawless, so far.\\xa0 Far beyond our expectations.\\xa0 You should say, “I hear you’re doing well, but maybe…”\\n\\nI don’t even hear of any glitch.\\xa0 They’ve done billions of dollars of loans to small business.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can you ensure people they will get their money, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And these are great loans.\\xa0 These are loans that get immediately paid off.\\xa0 These are loans that get businesses back.\\n\\nI wish you could ask a question where something is working so well.\\xa0 Now, maybe things won’t work well, and I don’t mind that kind.\\xa0 But where something is working so well and you ask a question in such a negative way —\\n\\nUh, it’s doing great.\\xa0 Yeah, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Some banks are adding extra rules, sir, for —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s doing great.\\xa0 Really good.\\xa0 Maybe it won’t in two weeks, and I’ll respond differently.\\xa0 But it’s doing great.\\xa0 You know it and so does everyone else.\\xa0 Everyone is shocked how well it’s doing.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, Dr. Birx has mentioned in the past —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Who did?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Birx.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — some demographics such as seeing that men might be more susceptible to the virus, seeing in Europe more cases among the between 30 and 50 class.\\xa0 Has the data that you’ve seen in the past two weeks changed that assessment?\\xa0 Are men more susceptible?\\xa0 What are you seeing?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t think it changed much, has it?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 No, it’s the same pattern as Europe.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s the same pattern.\\xa0 Same answer that we’ve given you for the last —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So that includes — that includes folks with — between 30 and 50 being more adversely affected than what we’ve seen in Asia?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 No, I — tomorrow, I’ll bring you all the graphs back so you can it (inaudible).\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We can bring an updated graph, but it’s very similar.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, a few days ago you talked about possibly restricting flights from hotspots.\\xa0 Where are you on that ways of thinking now?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re looking at it very seriously.\\xa0 Right now, we’re dealing with governors, we’re dealing with airlines, we’re dealing with a lot of different factors.\\xa0 It’s a very difficult decision.\\xa0 We’re also doing testing getting into planes.\\xa0 Very strong testing.\\xa0 States are doing testing of people that leave planes because they don’t want to have people coming in who are infected.\\n\\nSo understanding that — and the level of testing has been enormous.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 And some states are saying you have to go in quarantine for two weeks if you come from certain areas.\\xa0 So, knowing that, we’re working with the governors.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, what kind of tests — when you say “testing,” do you mean domestic travel or people coming in from outside the country?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Both.\\xa0 Both.\\xa0 Some states are doing when they land — they’re doing very strong, very powerful testing.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You know, we’ve talked to some airlines, sir, and they say they don’t know what you’re talking about when you say that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 okay, well, then you’ll check them again.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 One last question on ventilators.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Governments are doing too — our government.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 One last question on ventilators.\\xa0 The governor of New York said that he received donation in ventilators from Jack Ma of Alibaba, which I think is your friend.\\xa0 Would you call on the business community to donate ventilators, not necessarily to New York, but other states like Louisiana —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I would.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and Michigan?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, Jack Ma is a friend of mine and he’s made it very possible to get about 1,000 from ventilators from China.\\xa0 But that was from him and my other friend.\\xa0 It was really a gift, and we appreciate it very much.\\xa0 It was very nice of them.\\n\\nAll right.\\xa0 I think we’ve had enough.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 One more?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’ll be seeing you very soon.\\xa0 And I’m sure that you know that all of us are going to be working very hard.\\xa0 We’re working very hard.\\xa0 We are really coming up into a time that’s going to be very horrendous, probably a time like we haven’t seen in this country.\\xa0 Wouldn’t you say?\\xa0 I mean, I don’t think we’ve seen a time like this in the country.\\n\\nAnd we’re getting to that — that point where it’s going to really be some very bad numbers.\\xa0 And we want to keep those numbers a lot lower than they would have been.\\xa0 And we will do that.\\n\\nWe have tremendous talent working.\\xa0 We have tremendous people, and that includes governors; that includes everybody. Everybody is working.\\n\\nBut unfortunately, we’re getting to that time when the numbers are going to peak, and it’s not going to be a good-looking situation.\\xa0 I really believe we probably have never seen anything like these kind of numbers.\\xa0 Maybe during the war, during the — a World War, or a World War One or Two or something.\\xa0 But this is a war all unto itself.\\xa0 And it’s — it’s a terrible thing.\\n\\nWe will be seeing you soon.\\xa0 We’ll keep you totally abreast.\\xa0 We’re also going to be releasing new ventilator numbers, because we have a lot of them coming and a lot of them going to different locations.\\n\\nAnd we appreciate it very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nEND\\n\\n5:59 P.M.

EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I just had a meeting with Kevin McCarthy, future Speaker of the House, I hope.\\xa0 And he’s done a fantastic job for the people of California.\\xa0 And also, the people of California have done a fantastic job, when you look at the — at the bump.\\xa0 You take a look at the bump and how they’re doing out there.\\xa0 So I congratulate everybody out there.\\n\\nBut I thought I’d have Kevin say a few words.\\xa0 So, Kevin, please.\\n\\nLEADER MCCARTHY:\\xa0 Well, thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 And I would like to thank you.\\xa0 On the basis of California, Governor Newsom says the work that you’re doing together has been — you’re working very closely — has been effective in California as well — the Vice President and the President.\\n\\nYou know, today, Mr. President, I want to thank you, especially for the work that Secretary Mnuchin has done, especially for small businesses.\\xa0 Just today alone, I saw Bank of America had more than 10,000 loans in two hours.\\n\\nAnd for anybody who’s in small business — My first small business was when I was 20 years old.\\xa0 You don’t have income coming in right now, you get a loan, but for your rent, paying your employees, and paying your utilities is a grant.\\xa0 That’s part of the CARES Act.\\xa0 And I think you’re going to find that a lot of small businesses are going to hire people back, keep them afloat through the next two months, and get this economy moving again as we get through this virus.\\xa0 So I just want to thank you for all that work.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Great job you’re doing.\\n\\nLEADER MCCARTHY:\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 You go ahead.\\xa0 I’ll talk to you later.\\n\\nOkay, thank you very much, everybody.\\xa0 And I want to start by saying that our hearts go out to the people of New York as they bear the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in America.\\xa0 That seems to be the hotspot right now.\\xa0 But you have some others, as you know, that are very — very bad.\\xa0 Very bad.\\xa0 Louisiana is getting hit very hard.\\xa0 Parts of Michigan are getting hit very, very hard.\\xa0 New Jersey is — is –surprisingly, it’s much greater than anybody would have thought.\\xa0 They’re doing a really good job.\\xa0 The governor is doing a really good job out there.\\n\\nNew York’s first responders, EMTs, doctors, nurses are showing incredible courage under pressure.\\xa0 They’re the best in the world.\\xa0 We will take every action and we’ll spare no resource — financial, medical, scientific.\\xa0 We will not spare anything.\\xa0 We’ll get it back into shape.\\n\\nThe Empire State — the governor is doing an excellent job.\\xa0 They’re all working very hard together.\\xa0 At the request of the governor, as you know, the Javits Center, we have 2,500 beds, and we’re going to allow that to be a system where this horrible disease can be looked after, the patients can be looked after.\\xa0 That was going to be for regular medical problems such as accidents.\\xa0 And, you know, it’s very interesting, the governor is telling me we don’t have too many accidents and very few people driving.\\n\\nSo we’re going to put that facility into play, which is a big facility.\\xa0 The ship will be staying the way it is, but we’re putting that facility into play to help them.\\n\\nAnd today, also, the CDC is announcing additional steps Americans can take to defend against the transmission of the virus.\\xa0 From recent studies, we know that the transmission from individuals without symptoms is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood.\\xa0 So you don’t seem to have symptoms and it still gets transferred.\\n\\nIn light of these studies, the CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure.\\xa0 So it’s voluntary; you don’t have to do it.\\xa0 They suggested for a period of time.\\xa0 But this is voluntary.\\xa0 I don’t think I’m going to be doing it.\\n\\nBut you have a lot of ways — you can look at it as follows: The CDC is recommending that Americans wear a basic cloth or a fabric mask that can be either purchased online or simply made at home.\\xa0 Probably material that you’d have at home.\\xa0 These face coverings can be easily washed or reused.\\n\\nI want to emphasize that the CDC is not recommending the use of medical-grade or surgical-grade masks, and we want that to be used for our great medical people that are working so hard and doing some job.\\xa0 Medical protective gear must be reserved for the frontline healthcare workers who are performing those vital services.\\n\\nThe new mask guidelines also do not replace CDC’s guidance on social distancing, including staying in your home when possible, standing at least six feet apart for a period of time.\\xa0 Again, we’re going to all come back together here.\\xa0 We’re going to all come back together.\\xa0 And practicing hand hygiene, which we should do anyway.\\n\\nA lot of things, I think, are going to spill over.\\xa0 Shaking hands maybe will stay with our country for a long time beyond this.\\xa0 One of the — one of our great doctors was telling me that — as you know, we have flus every year, and the number of people killed by the flu is very substantial.\\xa0 And said that if they didn’t shake hands, that number would be substantially lower.\\xa0 So maybe it’ll stay.\\xa0 Maybe some of these things, long term, will be good.\\xa0 But those guidelines are still the best and the safest way to avoid the infection.\\n\\nSo with the masks, it’s going to be, really, a voluntary thing.\\xa0 You can do it.\\xa0 You don’t have to do it.\\xa0 I’m choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it, and that’s okay.\\xa0 It may be good.\\xa0 Probably will.\\xa0 They’re making a recommendation.\\xa0 It’s only a recommendation.\\xa0 It’s voluntary.\\n\\nWe’re also taking action to ensure the cost of no barrier to any American seeking testing or treatment of the coronavirus.\\xa0 The largest insurer nationwide, the BlueCross BlueShield System, has now announced that it will not require any co-pays — which is really something; that’s a tremendous statement — from patients of the virus treatment for the next 60 days, similar to the commitments of Cigna, Humana, Anthem.\\xa0 Those are great companies, and they’re all doing the same thing.\\xa0 So, co-pays.\\xa0 For them to do that is — it’s a big statement.\\xa0 We appreciate it.\\n\\nToday I can so proudly announce that hospitals and healthcare providers treating uninsured coronavirus patients will be reimbursed by the federal government using funds from the economic relief package Congress passed last month.\\xa0 So that was as per the question yesterday and actually the day before yesterday.\\xa0 This should alleviate any concern uninsured Americans may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment.\\xa0 So that’s, I think, answers the question pretty well and very much in the favor of our great people.\\n\\nI’m also signing a directive invoking the Defense Production Act to prohibit export of scarce health and medical supplies by unscrupulous actors and profiteers.\\n\\nThe security and Secretary — the Secretary of Homeland Security will work with FEMA to prevent the export of N95 respirators, surgical masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment.\\xa0 We need these items immediately for domestic use.\\xa0 We have to have them.\\xa0 But we’ve done really well with the purchase of items, and you’ll be hearing about that shortly.\\n\\nWe’ve already leveraged the DPA to stop the hoarding and price gouging of crucial supplies.\\xa0 Under that authority, this week, the Department of Health and Human Services, working with the Department of Justice, took custody of nearly 200,000 N95 respirators, 130,000 surgical masks, 600,000 gloves, as well as bottles — many, many, many bottles — and disinfectant sprays that were being hoarded.\\xa0 All of this material is now being given to healthcare workers.\\xa0 Most of it has already been given out.\\xa0 And we’ve given a lot to New York, a lot in New Jersey, a lot to other places.\\n\\nIn addition to ensure that healthcare workers in New York have the protective equipment they need, the federal government, in the name of the Department of Defense, is providing about 8.1 million N95 respirators.\\xa0 Department of Defense.\\xa0 And we’ve already given 200,000 of them to New York City.\\xa0 Mayor de Blasio needed them very badly, so we got them to Mayor de Blasio in New York City.\\xa0 And they were very grateful.\\xa0 8.1 million.\\xa0 And we’re going to be increasing that number from 8.1 million to more.\\xa0 That’s a lot of N95 respirators.\\n\\nToday, my team spoke with the CEO of Ochsner Health and the CEO of LCMC, the two largest health systems in New Orleans.\\xa0 They said they feel that they currently have enough ventilators — I think a lot of people are going to have enough ventilators — and masks, and appreciate what we did and all of the things we’ve been doing with them, working with them.\\n\\nThe CEO of Ochsner, Warner Thomas — who’s really been fantastic, I have to say — indicated a need for 230,000 surgical gowns.\\xa0 And I instructed FEMA to deliver them tomorrow.\\xa0 So they’ll have the 230,000.\\xa0 That’s Louisiana — New Orleans.\\xa0 Two hundred and thirty thousand surgical gowns; they’ll have them by tomorrow.\\n\\nWe’re expanding the role of the armed forces in our response effort because no one is better prepared to win a war than the United States military.\\xa0 And we are in a war.\\xa0 The invisible enemy — remember.\\n\\nOver 9,000 retired Army medical personnel have answered their nation’s call and are now supporting field hospitals and medical facilities all across the country, like what I just told you, that Governor Cuomo requested we do something in Javits, where we take it over.\\xa0 And we’re going to have that manned by the military, because it’s very tough to get people — more people in the New York area.\\xa0 So we’re going to have it manned by the military — Javits Center.\\n\\nNational Guard members have been activated to help states build new treatment centers and assist in the seamless distribution of medical supplies.\\xa0 That includes National Guard.\\xa0 The National Guard is assisting very strongly because the states were, in many cases, unable to have the delivery capability from warehouses and other places that we put the supplies.\\xa0 So I’ve given approval to use the National Guards — the various National Guards in the different states.\\xa0 And they’re doing a fantastic job of not only protecting people but delivering material.\\n\\nThe Army Corps of Engineers has assessed more than 100 facilities in all 50 states and is rapidly building temporary hospitals and alternative care sites in many states: in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington Wisconsin, Ohio.\\xa0 They’re doing a lot of work in just those states, plus additionals, that are being — will be announced probably tomorrow.\\xa0 But they’re doing some job.\\xa0 The Army Corps of Engineers — what a job they’re doing.\\xa0 And FEMA — what a job they’re doing.\\n\\nAs we deploy the power of our military, we’re also deploying the skill of our doctors, scientists, and medical researchers.\\xa0 We continue to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and other therapies, and the treatment and prevention of the virus.\\xa0 And we will keep the American people fully informed on our findings.\\xa0 Hydroxychloroquine — I don’t know, it’s looking like it’s having some good results.\\xa0 I hope that — that would be a phenomenal thing.\\n\\nBut we have it right now in — approximately now, it’s increased to 1,500 people.\\xa0 I spoke with Dr. Zucker in New York — terrific guy, by the way.\\xa0 He’s — we’re doing a good job.\\xa0 And I spoke to Governor Cuomo last evening and this morning about it.\\xa0 So it’s been there for about three and a half days, but I think — and many other places it’s being tested too.\\xa0 And we have a tremendous supply of it.\\xa0 We’ve ordered it in the case that it works.\\xa0 And it’s — it could have some pretty big impacts.\\xa0 And we’ll see what happens.\\n\\nMy administration is also working to get relief to American workers and businesses.\\xa0 On day one of the Paycheck Protection Program, as Kevin said, more than $3.5. billion in guaranteed loans have been processed to help small businesses keep their workers employed during the unprecedented time — this unprecedented time.\\n\\nAnd Bank of America has been incredible.\\xa0 Of the big banks, Bank of America has really stepped forward and done a great job. And then you have the community banks, your smaller banks.\\xa0 And we’re already at $3.5 billion going out to incredible people.\\xa0 But that’s way ahead of schedule.\\n\\nThe SBA and the Treasury are working around the clock, and our banking partners are really incredible.\\xa0 And they’re ensuring that the money gets to small businesses as quickly as possible, and then the small business, in turn, take care of employees that they would have had to let go, and now they’ll keep them.\\xa0 And that’s good.\\xa0 And then they’re going to open for business and they’re going to have their employees.\\xa0 And we’ll try and get back to where we were.\\xa0 Eventually, we’re going to supersede where we were.\\n\\nThe energy industry has been especially hard hit in the crisis.\\xa0 This afternoon, I met with Greg Garland of Phillips 66, Dave Hager of Devon Energy, Harold Hamm of Continental Resources, Jeff Hildebrand of Hilcorp Energy, Vicki Hollub of Occidental Petroleum, Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute, Kelcy Warren of Energy Transfer Partners, Mike Wirth of Chevron, and Darren Woods of Exxon Mobil.\\xa0 I informed them that we will be making space available in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to let American producers store surplus oil that can be sold at a later time.\\n\\nThere’s a tremendous abundance of oil, primarily because of the virus.\\xa0 The virus has just stopped demand of everything, including oil.\\xa0 So we’re working with our great energy companies.\\xa0 These are great companies.\\xa0 They employ tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people.\\xa0 And they’ve kept America really going for a long time.\\xa0 And no big price hikes, no big anything.\\xa0 I mean, they’ve just kept it going.\\xa0 And now they got hit.\\xa0 But with all the jobs and all of the good that they do, we’re going to make sure that they stay in good shape.\\n\\nAmerica is engaged in a historic battle to safeguard the lives of our citizens, our future society.\\xa0 Our greatest weapon is the discipline and determination of every citizen to stay at home and stay healthy for a long time.\\xa0 And we want them to stay healthy for a long time.\\xa0 So stay at home.\\xa0 This is ending.\\xa0 This will end.\\xa0 You’ll see some bad things and then you’re going to see some really good things.\\xa0 And it’s not going to be too long.\\n\\nWe will heal our citizens and we will care for our neighbors, and we will unleash the full might of the United States of America to vanquish the virus.\\n\\nAnd with that, I’d like to ask Mike Pence to come up, Vice President, and say a few words.\\xa0 And we’ll have a couple of other quick talks on a couple of subjects, and we’ll take questions.\\n\\nAnd it’s a beautiful Friday in Washington, D.C., and our country is a great place, and we’re getting better.\\xa0 We’re getting better very quickly.\\n\\nThis was artificially induced.\\xa0 We just said — they said, “Close it down.\\xa0 You have to close it down.”\\xa0 We closed it down and we’re healing.\\xa0 We’re going to get it better fast.\\n\\nSo, Mike, if you could come up say a few words.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 The President just outlined a number of the decisions that he made today on the unanimous recommendation to the White House Coronavirus Task Force.\\n\\nIn addition, some good news Dr. Deborah Birx will reflect on in a moment.\\xa0 And some of the areas across America where we see evidence that the mitigation efforts — the American people putting into practice the President’s coronavirus guidelines — are having a positive effect.\\n\\nIn fact, today, California and Washington State, where the coronavirus first emerged in our country, remain — the cases remain at a steady but low rate.\\xa0 And we know, as Governor Newsom said yesterday, that they’re not out of the woods yet.\\xa0 We continue to flow resources.\\n\\nBut we want to commend people in those states and all across the country who are putting into practice the social distancing and all the measures that state and local leaders are advising and that — and that the President has been advising in the coronavirus guidelines for America.\\n\\nWe’re also continuing to track significant outbreaks in New York State, New Orleans, Detroit, Chicago, and Boston.\\xa0 And as the President indicated, we’re prioritizing resources to support healthcare workers and to support those that are dealing with the coronavirus in those communities.\\n\\nOn the subject of testing, now more than 1.4 million tests have been performed across the country.\\xa0 And as you all are aware, some 266,000 Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus.\\n\\nAbbott instruments, which now can perform a 15-minute test across the country, have literally 18,000 of their machines across the nation today.\\xa0 But at the President’s direction, FEMA is acquiring over 1,200 more machines to distribute to every state public health lab in America and also to our Indian Healthcare Service.\\n\\nAnd the big news, of course, over the last few days was that the FDA — once again, in near record time — has approved an antibody test developed by Cellex.\\xa0 And we’re continuing on the White House Coronavirus Task Force to examine ways that we can scale up these rapid tests and these innovative new tests not just to meet this moment, but to lay a foundation for testing across the nation in the months ahead.\\n\\nAs the President mentioned, he met with energy executives today and continues to engage with leaders of businesses all across the nation.\\n\\nWe also have held a teleconference today with commercial retailers.\\xa0 On the President’s behalf, we thanked them for the way that people that operate malls and shopping centers around the country have embraced and enacted the coronavirus guidelines for America.\\xa0 It’s had enormous impact on their businesses and their industries.\\xa0 But I heard — I heard from them their — their patriotic commitment to put the health of their associates and their customers first.\\xa0 And it was deeply inspiring.\\n\\nOn the subject of supplies, the President detailed our work in that space.\\xa0 It continues to this day.\\xa0 As part of our air bridge, we had a flight arrive from China today to Columbus, Ohio.\\xa0 We continue to work each and every day, watching the data about cases, to ensure that, in particular, not just the personal protective equipment is available for the healthcare workers that are on the frontlines, but also that ventilators are available as the — as this epidemic makes its way through regions and communities.\\xa0 We are literally working hour by hour, day by day to make sure that patients, families, and healthcare providers have the equipment and the support that they need.\\n\\nAs the President mentioned, we’ve seen over a billion and a half dollars in loans go out through the Paycheck Protection Program today.\\n\\nWe have available for questions the head of the CDC today to speak about the new guidance on cloth face coverings.\\n\\nAnd Secretary Azar, in a few moments, will explain just how the President’s decision to make sure that no American will ever have to worry about paying for testing or for coronavirus treatment.\\n\\nI’m pleased to report, at the President’s direction, Medicaid and Medicare already expanded to coronavirus treatment and testing early on.\\n\\nAnd of course, the President just indicated how major insurance companies across the country are not just waiving co-pays on testing, but they’re now waiving co-pays for at least 60 days on any coronavirus treatment.\\n\\nBut now, as Secretary Azar will enumerate, now we’ll make sure that any American, even those that have no insurance, will be able to receive treatment in a hospital and never have to worry about the bill.\\n\\nI’ll just give a general reminder to every American: There is evidence across the country that you’re putting into practice the coronavirus guidelines for America.\\xa0 Every American has a role to play.\\xa0 And I want to thank you on behalf of the President and all of the American people for the way that you’re stepping forward, you’re engaging in the social distancing, and doing the things that will slow the spread.\\n\\nWe encourage you to keep on keeping on.\\xa0 And we will get through this, America.\\xa0 We will get through the coronavirus to that day of renewed health and renewed prosperity that the President always describes.\\xa0 But we’ll get through there sooner and we’ll get through there when we work together.\\n\\nDr. Birx?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Thank you Mr. Vice President, Mr. President.\\xa0 Thank you for your words of discipline and determination.\\xa0 I guess that really describes what we’re asking every American to really be: disciplined about these guidelines and really determined to stay in that space of execution.\\n\\nYou know we are just in week three on — of this full guidance measure.\\xa0 We really do appreciate the work of the citizens of California and Washington State, because we do see that their curve is different.\\xa0 Their curve is different from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.\\xa0 And we really believe that the work that every citizen is doing in those states is making a difference and it will make a difference for the frontline healthcare providers.\\n\\nWe also are deeply grateful, despite the way their curve looks today, they continue to get ready for a different potential, so that they can ensure that patients, if they do get sick, have options and availability.\\n\\nTo all the frontline healthcare workers in the — what we have referred to as “hot zones” — areas where the number of cases are quite significant — the New Orleans; the New York City metro area, including New Jersey and Connecticut — the incredible work that the frontline healthcare workers are providing.\\xa0 We’re really working now at a much more granular level, talking directly to hospitals to ensure that they have the supplies that they need in coordination with state and local governments.\\n\\nAnd to work — I think we discussed it yesterday, but I think it was quite clear also — and reiterated by Governor Cuomo today — that we have to support one another as each of these different metro areas, and other areas, move through their peak of new infections.\\n\\nWhen we talked about it at the beginning of this week, we talked about this week and next week being incredibly difficult.\\xa0 And we want to recognize the number of Americans who have lost their lives to this virus, and recognize the sacrifice that healthcare providers are making both in their care, but I think I’m very uplifted by hearing their messages to families and their compassion for others to provide that kind of support to the individuals in the hospital.\\n\\nWe continue to watch, in addition, the Chicago area, the Detroit area, and have some developing concerns around Colorado, the District of Columbia, and Pennsylvania.\\xa0 So as you can see, each of these will follow their own curves.\\xa0 We’ll be getting more and more of those case, over time, information in a very granular way to each and every one of you so that we can follow these epidemiologic curves as each of these states, counties, and communities move through this together in solidarity, and really ensuring that we can move supplies creatively around the country to meet the needs of both the frontline healthcare providers but also every American who needs our support right now.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\n\\nSECRETARY AZAR:\\xa0 Well, thank you, Mr. President, for your continued leadership as we battle the coronavirus.\\xa0 First, I want to thank all of the members of the HHS team and the frontline healthcare workers across America, including those who — those service workers who serve in our hospitals, at our healthcare facilities, those who clean, those who deliver, those who stock the shelves — all those who are going into battle every day against the virus.\\xa0 Your country has asked you to serve as never before, and you have responded heroically.\\n\\nI’m going to provide a brief update on the administration’s plans to cover the testing and treatment for the uninsured.\\xa0 Getting the uninsured access to the care they need is a top priority for President Trump.\\xa0 We are already rolling out the $1 billion in funding from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act to cover providers’ expenses for testing and diagnosing the uninsured.\\n\\nThe CARES Act, signed by the President, includes another $100 billion for healthcare providers.\\xa0 Under the President’s direction, we will use a portion of that funding to cover providers’ costs of delivering COVID-19 care for the uninsured, sending the money to providers through the same mechanism used for testing.\\n\\nAs a condition of receiving funds under this program, providers will be forbidden from balance billing the uninsured for the cost of their care.\\xa0 Providers will be reimbursed at Medicare rates.\\n\\nWe will soon have more specifics on how the rest of the $100 billion will go to providers.\\xa0 We’re working to ensure that this funding is distributed in a way that is fast, fair, simple, and transparent.\\n\\nI’d also like to remind people that if you’ve lost employer insurance coverage, you have insurance options that you should look into.\\xa0 You’d be eligible for a special enrollment period on the healthcare exchanges, and depending on your state, you may be eligible for Medicaid.\\n\\nJust as President Trump is working to ensure that COVID-19 treatment is paid for, he’s working to support new treatment options for patients.\\xa0 Thanks to the President’s leadership, many providers are trying different experimental therapies, and we need as much data as we can collect as quickly as possible on how these treatments are working.\\n\\nToday, Oracle has developed and is donating to the government and the American people a web portal and platform to gather crowd-sourced, real-time information from providers about how patients respond to potential therapeutics.\\xa0 While this doesn’t replace the important work of clinical trials, it gives us data rapidly.\\xa0 If you are a doctor or a healthcare provider and you would like to help us, you can sign up today to begin reporting on your work.\\xa0 There’s a special registration page for providers at COVID19.Oracle.com.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Okay, let’s go.\\xa0 Steve?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If we could draw you out a little bit more on the advice on face masks.\\xa0 What do — what would people gain from wearing a mask?\\xa0 And why are you opposed to wearing one yourself?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I just don’t want to wear one myself.\\xa0 It’s a recommendation; they recommend it.\\xa0 I’m feeling good.\\xa0 I just don’t want to be doing — I don’t know, somehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk — the great Resolute Desk — I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don’t know.\\xa0 Somehow, I don’t see it for myself.\\xa0 I just — I just don’t.\\xa0 Maybe I’ll change my mind, but this will pass and hopefully it’ll pass very quickly.\\n\\nNow, with that being said, if somebody wants to — I mean, most people can just make something out of a certain material.\\xa0 So it’s very well designated, it’s very simple to do.\\xa0 I won’t be doing it personally.\\xa0 It’s a recommendation.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nAnd would you like to say something about that?\\n\\nSURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 Absolutely.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Surgeon General, please.\\n\\nSURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:\\xa0 Well, thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Mr. Secretary, and CDC Director Redfield.\\xa0 I especially want to thank the folks at the CDC.\\xa0 And it’s a great question that you ask; it’s a fair question that you ask.\\xa0 I want to unpack the evolution of our guidance on masks because it has been confusing to the American people.\\n\\nFirst of all, I want people to understand that the CDC, the World Health Organization, my office, and most public health and health organizations and professionals originally recommended against the general public wearing masks, because based on the best evidence available at the time, it was not deemed that that would have a significant impact on whether or not a healthy person wearing a mask would contract COVID-19.\\n\\nWe have always recommended that symptomatic people wear a mask, because if you’re coughing, if you have a fever, if you’re symptomatic, you could transmit disease to other people.\\n\\nWhat has changed in our recommendation?\\xa0 Well, it’s important to know that we now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms.\\xa0 They’re what we call asymptomatic.\\xa0 And that even those who eventually become pre-symptomatic, meaning that they will develop symptoms in the future, can transmit the virus to others before they show symptoms.\\xa0 This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity: for example, coughing, speaking, or sneezing, even if those people were not exhibiting symptoms.\\n\\nIn light of this new evidence, CDC recommends and the task force recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.\\xa0 These include places like grocery stores and pharmacies.\\xa0 We especially recommend this in areas of significant community-based transmission.\\xa0 It is critical.\\n\\nAnd the President mentioned this, the Vice President mentioned this: It’s critical to emphasize that maintaining six feet of social distancing remains key to slowing the spread of the virus.\\n\\nBut CDC is additionally advising the use of simple cloth coverings to slow the spread of the virus and to help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.\\n\\nThe cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N95 respirators.\\xa0 Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by the current CDC guidance.\\n\\nAs the President also mentioned, cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional voluntary public health measure.\\n\\nThis recommendation complements and does not replace the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America, “30 Days to Slow the Spread,” which remains the cornerstone of our national effort to slow the spread of the virus.\\n\\nCDC is always — always looking at the data.\\xa0 We told you that from the beginning — Dr. Birx says it every single press conference — we’re looking at the data, we’re evolving our recommendations, and new recommendations will come as the evidence dictates.\\n\\nSo, I want to say if you do choose to wear a face mask — very important — wash your hands first because you don’t want to put on a face covering with a dirty hand.\\xa0 Do not touch your face while you are wearing the face covering because, again, you could take materials from the surface, germs from the surface and bring it to your face.\\xa0 If you choose to wear a face covering, please — please leave the N95 mask, the medical supplies for the medical professionals, healthcare workers, and frontline workers.\\n\\nKnow that this is not a substitute for social distancing.\\xa0 And remember, this is all about me protecting you, and you protecting me.\\xa0 This is about us coming together as communities.\\xa0 And if people voluntarily choose to wear a face covering, they’re wearing it to protect their neighbors from getting the coronavirus, because, again, they could have asymptomatic spread.\\n\\nSo, Mr. President, thank you very much for that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nSURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:\\xa0 Appreciate the opportunity to update everyone.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Great job.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nOkay.\\xa0 Jon?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, Dr. Fauci last night recommended — said that every state should have stay-at-home orders right now.\\xa0 Do you agree with that?\\xa0 Should every state in this country have the kind of stay-at-home orders that we now see in places like Washington and New York?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I leave it up to the governors.\\xa0 The governors know what they’re doing.\\xa0 They’ve been doing a great job.\\xa0 I guess we’re close to 90 percent anyway.\\xa0 And the states that we’re talking about are not in jeopardy.\\xa0 No, I would leave it to the governors.\\xa0 I like — I like that from the standpoint of governing, and I like that from the standpoint of even our Constitution.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, to address the shortage in the blood supply, the Food and Drug Administration announced yesterday —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I pointed to him.\\xa0 Right?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thanks, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I knew we (inaudible).\\xa0 I heard a different voice.\\xa0 I heard a different voice.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 We’ll get you later.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Going to the oil meeting previously —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — is the U.S. willing to cut domestic oil production?\\xa0 What came out of the meeting?\\xa0 What was the consensus?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, a lot of things came out.\\xa0 It’s a great industry, it’s an important industry, it’s a tremendous job-producing industry.\\xa0 And it’s just vital.\\xa0 And it was also very interesting because they all were given the test before they came into the room.\\xa0 So you have the head of Exxon Mobil, you have all these guys taking the test, and they all passed with flying colors.\\xa0 So that was good.\\xa0 They left happy, in that respect, at least.\\n\\nThere’s just an overabundance of oil right now — oil and gas.\\xa0 Tremendous overabundance.\\xa0 And it was caused — they were doing a great job.\\xa0 They were producing a lot of energy.\\xa0 But then you have the virus come along and it knocked another 35 percent, maybe 40 percent, off of the market.\\n\\nSo there’s too much oil.\\xa0 There’s a glut.\\xa0 And these are great companies and they’ll figure it out.\\xa0 It’s free market.\\xa0 We’ll figure it out.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You spoke to President Putin.\\xa0 I mean, what’s on the table here with him —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And with the Crown Prince.\\xa0 Both.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They were having a competition.\\xa0 We’ll see how it all works out.\\xa0 I think it’s going to work out very well.\\xa0 It’s going to take a long time to — to get rid of that.\\xa0 There’s massive excess amount of oil and gas.\\xa0 Massive.\\xa0 Like probably there’s never been.\\n\\nSo where that does work out well, I guess you could say, is for drivers.\\xa0 I think, in certain locations, it’s down to 90 and 95 cents a gallon, right now, on the road.\\n\\nBut we have a tremendous industry, a great industry.\\xa0 A tremendously important industry from the standpoint of jobs.\\xa0 And we’re energy independent.\\xa0 We have to make sure we keep it that way.\\n\\nAll right, please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, as I was saying, the Food and Drug Administration, to address the shortage of blood supply, announced yesterday it would ease the restrictions on certain donors, including gay men, who are now required to be abstinent for 3 months, as opposed to 12 months, to donate.\\xa0 Did you have a hand in that change?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I didn’t know anything about that.\\xa0 That was done by the FDA — very capable people at the FDA.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, Mr. President.\\xa0 Both the government of Canada and 3M are pushing back on this DPA not to export N95 respirators.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 3M says —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t blame them.\\xa0 They can push back if they want.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, but they’re saying —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re not happy with 3M.\\xa0 We’re not happy.\\xa0 And the people that dealt with it directly are not at all happy with 3M.\\n\\nSo we’ll see whether or not we do.\\xa0 I heard what he had to say today.\\xa0 I don’t know the gentleman.\\xa0 But we’re not happy with 3M.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And where is Dr. Fauci?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 But every time you ask that question — whenever he’s not here, you look, you say, “Where is he?”\\xa0 And you’ll say, “Is there a problem?”\\xa0 No problem whatsoever.\\xa0 Every time he’s not here — sometimes I’ll ask him to come because that’s the first question that you and a couple of others from the fake news establishment ask, is: “Where is Dr. Fauci?”\\xa0 We’re doing great together.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A different subject, if I may ask.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Except we’re covering a different subject today.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A different subject, if I may ask.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0 Go ahead, Jim.\\xa0 Try another one.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you have you have said nobody could have seen this pandemic coming, but, in fact, Secretary Azar, at a biodefense summit in April of 2019, said, “Of course, the people” — “Of course, the thing that people ask, ‘What keeps you most up at night in the biodefense world?’ Pandemic flu, of course.\\xa0 I think everyone in this room probably shares that concern.”\\xa0 Your own Health and Human Services Secretary was aware that this had the potential of being a very big problem around the world, a pandemic of this nature.\\xa0 Who dropped the ball?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I always knew that pandemics are one of the worst things that could happen.\\xa0 There’s been nothing like this since probably 1917.\\xa0 That was the big one in Europe.\\xa0 It started actually here and went to Europe.\\xa0 Probably.\\xa0 I’ve heard about —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You’ve also said nobody could see this coming.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Excuse me.\\xa0 Wait a minute.\\xa0 Let me finish.\\xa0 I’ve heard about this for a long time — pandemics.\\xa0 You don’t want pandemics.\\xa0 And I don’t think he was talking about a specific pandemic.\\xa0 He was talking about the threat of a pandemic could happen.\\xa0 And it could happen.\\xa0 Most people thought it wouldn’t and most people didn’t understand the severity of it.\\xa0 This is a very severe.\\xa0 What’s happened is very severe.\\xa0 But I’d let you answer that.\\xa0 I assume that he was talking about the concept of a pandemic.\\n\\nSECRETARY AZAR:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Actually — absolutely, for 15 years now, this country has had a massive effort at the federal, state, and local level of preparedness for a pandemic.\\xa0 Now, that largely has been, as I said in those remarks, about pandemic flu preparedness.\\xa0 We knew about SARS, we knew about MERS, which were earlier modifications or variants of the coronavirus.\\xa0 None of those achieved anything like what we’re seeing today.\\n\\nBut that’s why, for successive presidencies, including the leadership of President Trump, there has been a great focus on pandemic preparedness.\\xa0 In fact, it was just in November, I believe, that the President signed the Pandemic Flu Preparedness executive order that we have — and we have also updated the Pandemic Crisis Action Plan, which has been the playbook from which we’ve been working the Pandemic Flu Plan.\\xa0 Again, the action plan from which we have been working that coordinates the whole-of-government, whole-of-economy approach here.\\n\\nSo we’ve all been very focused on pandemic preparedness.\\xa0 That’s what we do.\\n\\nBut this particular strain of pandemic, who would — who would have known this particular strain?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But, Secretary Azar, if you were preparing for a pandemic, if this government were preparing for a pandemic, why is it we don’t have enough masks?\\xa0 Why is it we don’t have enough medical equipment in this country?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Previous administrations gave us very little ammunition for the military and very little shelf space.\\xa0 Let me just tell you —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But you’ve been President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You know it —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You’ve been President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You know the answer.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — three or four years now.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The previous administration, the shelves were empty.\\xa0 The shelves were empty.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You had time to stock the shelves.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0So what you should do is speak to the people from the previous administration, Jim, and ask them that question, because —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you’ve been in office —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — the shelves were empty.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — for almost four years.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And you know what else?\\xa0 The military shelves were also empty.\\xa0 We had no ammunition, literally.\\xa0 And that was said by one of your favorite generals.\\xa0 “We have — sir, we have no ammunition.”\\xa0 Guess what?\\xa0 We had very little medical supply also.\\n\\nAll right.\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Isn’t that a cop-out, though?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Isn’t that a cop-out?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’ll get it back.\\xa0 We’ll get you back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But, Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’ll get you back, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But what about that question —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Jim, I said we’ll get you back.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So I want to ask about the DPA.\\xa0 So you said that there will be a ban on exporting of all — what does it cover?\\xa0 So, masks, gloves?\\xa0 What else is included in that order?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It covers everything.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And are you concerned —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But if somebody ordered — if Italy, if Spain, who has big problems — these have — these are countries with tremendous problems — France.\\xa0 If they ordered — if they have long-term orders and they’re in in there and they want to get certain things, I’ve let them go out, in certain instances, because I think it’s only fair.\\xa0 They have problems that are proportionately or relatively bigger than our problems.\\xa0 So if they ordered something and they’re waiting for, as an example, masks made here and going to Italy, I’m not going to be stopping that.\\xa0 I think it would be very unfair.\\n\\nAnd, by the way, speaking about being fair and unfair, two very big cruise liners, as you know, I allowed them to dock today.\\xa0 We worked with the governor of Florida, as you know, Ron DeSantis, and we worked on it and we had tremendous security.\\n\\nAnd we took the sick people and we’re working with them.\\xa0 We have doctors.\\xa0 We have great doctors, military doctors.\\xa0 And from a humane standpoint, not that we’re in love with this — these are two massive ships — but we have to take care of people.\\xa0 We have to take care.\\n\\nWe sent many back to Canada.\\xa0 The Canada — the Canadians came and worked very closely with us, as did the UK.\\xa0 We had a lot of people from the UK.\\xa0 And we take — we took care of the Americans.\\xa0 We took care of the sick.\\xa0 We had some people very sick.\\xa0 I think we have three to four, maybe five people that had died on the boat.\\xa0 One of the boats, actually.\\xa0 And we had to take care of these people.\\n\\nSo we couldn’t let them float aimlessly into the ocean, looking for port, as they’ve been doing for a long time.\\xa0 And I made the decision: We had to take them in.\\xa0 And Homeland Security and a lot of other people did a great job.\\n\\nBut we had to help people.\\xa0 These are people that were very, very sick.\\xa0 Some were dying.\\xa0 Some died.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, on DPA — can I just finish, please?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, your staff, they said that people in close proximity to you and the Vice President will get a coronavirus test.\\xa0 I’m wondering, are you concerned that the people you’ve been hanging around with may have the virus?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I’m not concerned.\\xa0 No.\\xa0 I had a test yesterday.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But what’s the reason for the order for people who meet with you or talk to you?\\xa0 Why should they require coronavirus testing?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 I mean, I just — I heard from the oil executives.\\xa0 These are people — most of them had not had the test.\\xa0 And, frankly, I think they left the room feeling good about a lot of things.\\xa0 But they felt good about the test.\\n\\nThis was a test that took, I guess, 13 minutes to have it finalized.\\xa0 They took the test.\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 I didn’t know they were doing that.\\xa0 Maybe they did it just for them.\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 But —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But they’re always going to have to have a test?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — it seems that a lot of people — because now we have tests that really work well.\\xa0 Abbott, in this case. Abbott.\\xa0 We have other tests being developed right now that are also fantastic.\\n\\nThe original test — the ones we inherited, Jim, as an example, they were — they were broken.\\xa0 They were obsolete.\\xa0 They were not good tests.\\xa0 And that’s what we got stuck with.\\xa0 We’ve developed some incredible tests.\\xa0 But this took 13 to 15 minutes.\\xa0 And they were all fine.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On the DPA, sir —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Finish — finish your question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 So the problem some people have raised is that if the U.S. stopped exporting, what you could have is other countries then deciding reciprocally that they are going to stop exporting —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and that the result of that then will be a net decrease in the amount of supplies that American doctors, American hospitals have.\\xa0 How do you address that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I address it in the following manner: We really are very well supplied.\\xa0 We are not the principal — it’s the hospitals, the states, the cities.\\xa0 They’re supposed to get everything they can and stock up in case something like this happens.\\xa0 But nobody could ever have assumed that something like this happened, so we started supplying.\\n\\nWe brought tremendous amounts to New York today and over the last few days.\\xa0 We brought them to Louisiana.\\xa0 We brought them to Michigan.\\xa0 We brought them to Los Angeles.\\xa0 A lot of equipment.\\xa0 You’ve read the amount of masks that we had.\\xa0 I think I said over 8 million masks.\\xa0 The N95 masks.\\xa0 The, you know, more expensive, more complicated, better, whatever masks — the ones they want to use in the hospitals.\\n\\nWe have millions of them now, and we’ve given them to a lot.\\xa0 We sent to Bellevue, in New York today — that was for Mayor de Blasio — 200,000 of them.\\xa0 But we have 8.1 million; we’re going to have more than that.\\xa0 And we’re getting them from various sources, including the military.\\xa0 We’re rapidly then replacing them, because we have to replace them in case there’s a — another emergency.\\xa0 I would be — gowns too.\\xa0 We have many gowns being delivered and have been delivered.\\n\\nOur people have done an incredible job.\\xa0 Most people have said — now, and I said this yesterday — governors have said, “Thank you very much.\\xa0 Great job.”\\xa0 If they’re a Democrat governor — in some cases; not in all cases at all — if I said, “Here’s 1,000 ventilators.\\xa0 How many do you want?”\\xa0 “We want 1,000.”\\xa0 “Here’s 1,000.\\xa0 You got ’em.\\xa0 But you know what we’re going to do?\\xa0 We’re going to add another 5,000.\\xa0 Is that good?”\\xa0 They said, “Wow, that’s great.”\\xa0 And then, if Jim Acosta goes and says, “Are you happy with the President?”\\xa0 “No, he should have given us 10,000.”\\xa0 That’s what’s happening.\\xa0 You know why?\\xa0 Because that’s a standard political answer.\\xa0 And that’s a shame because we have done a job like nobody has ever done a job.\\n\\nBut we’ve just delivered a lot of masks.\\xa0 We’ve just delivered a lot of gowns and protective gear.\\xa0 But, you know, you’re talking about a massive — you’re talking about a massive number.\\xa0 But, as of this morning, people were very, very happy.\\n\\nSteve?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Did oil executives ask you for a bailout of any sort?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, they didn’t ask for a bailout.\\xa0 No.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What did they ask for?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It was really more of a discussion than asking.\\xa0 We discu- — you know, we did discuss the concept of tariffs because, as you know, this was a dispute among a couple of countries that I think they want to be able to get it solved.\\xa0 They had a dispute.\\xa0 They had a competition.\\xa0 But they want to get it resolved.\\n\\nRussia —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You mean tariffs — tariffs on —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — and Saudi Arabia, I think want to get it —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — Saudi and Russia?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 I think they want to get it resolved.\\xa0 I think they’re working very hard.\\xa0 I mean, they told me they want to get it resolved.\\xa0 They’re working very hard.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 President Trump, thank you.\\xa0 Yesterday, Jared Kushner said the notion of the federal stockpile was, it’s supposed to be “our” stockpile.\\xa0 It’s not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use.\\xa0 What did he mean by “our”?\\xa0 And —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, why don’t you ask him?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And even the fact that taxpayers from every state pays for it —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 What’s that?\\xa0 A “gotcha”?\\xa0 “I gotcha.”\\xa0 You used the word “our.”\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No, it’s not a “gotcha.”\\xa0 What did he mean by it?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 “Our” — you know, what “our” means?\\xa0 United States of America.\\xa0 That’s what it means.\\xa0 It means —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0So it means the states?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Our.\\xa0 Our.\\xa0 It means the United States of America.\\xa0 And then we take that “our” and we distribute it to the states.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So why did he say it’s not supposed —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Not that we have to —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — to be state stockpiles that they then can use?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Because we need it for the government and we need it for the federal government.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To give to the states.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But when the states are in trouble — no, to also keep —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Then who are you giving to if it’s not to the states?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 To keep — to keep for our country, because the federal government needs it too, not just the states.\\xa0 But out of that, we oftentimes choose — as an example, we have almost 10,000 ventilators and we are ready to rock with those ventilators.\\xa0 We’re going to bring them to various areas of the country that need them.\\xa0 But when he says “our,” he’s talking about our country.\\xa0 He’s talking —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But he makes the distinction.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Excuse me.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And, sir —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He’s talking about the federal government.\\xa0 I mean, it’s such a basic, simple question, and you try and make it sound so bad.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s not bad.\\xa0 I’m just trying to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You ought to be — you ought to be ashamed of yourself.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — understand.\\xa0 No — by the way, Secretary Azar —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You know what?\\xa0 You ought to be ashamed.\\xa0\\xa0 It’s such a simple question.\\xa0 He said “our.”\\xa0 And “our” means for the country and “our” means for the states —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But then he said it’s not supposed to be state stockpiles.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — because the states are part of the country.\\xa0 Don’t make it sound bad.\\xa0 Don’t make it sound bad.\\n\\nGo ahead, Steve.\\xa0 Go ahead, back here.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But, Mr. President, the HHS even changed the language on the website.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You just asked your question.\\xa0 You just asked your question in a very nasty tone.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I don’t think it was nasty.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Let’s go.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I think you didn’t give me an answer.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I gave you a perfect answer.\\xa0 You know it.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, just to follow up on that: When we have the federal stockpile — I mean, isn’t that designed to be able to distribute to the states who need it?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 But it’s also needed for the federal government.\\xa0 We have a federal stockpile and they have state stockpiles.\\xa0 And, frankly, they were — many of the states were totally unprepared for this.\\xa0 So we had to go into the federal stockpile.\\xa0 But we’re not an ordering clerk.\\xa0 They have to have for themselves.\\n\\nNow, some of the states were in good shape.\\xa0 Some of the states were not in good shape.\\xa0 That’s probably something you could expect.\\xa0 We have been helping states.\\xa0 We have been spending a tremendous amount of time, effort, and billions and billions of dollars on making sure that they have what they have.\\n\\nI mean, take New York: We built them hospitals — I built them four hospitals — built them medical centers, sent a ship with 1,000 rooms and 12 operating rooms, and then on top of that, gave vast numbers of ventilators and vast numbers of surgical gowns, equipment, masks, everything else.\\n\\nNow, they had a chance to order ventilators over the years.\\xa0 They had a chance to order a very big — but they didn’t choose to do it.\\xa0 We were there and we helped them.\\xa0 And I think the governor of New York is very thankful for the help that we gave.\\n\\nBut we have a stockpile.\\xa0 It’s a federal stockpile.\\xa0 We can use that for states, or we can use it for ourselves.\\xa0 We do use it for the federal government.\\xa0 We have a very big federal government.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So have you decided not to use your powers to be essentially a traffic cop for all the essential medical supplies that are needed in this?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re not a traffic cop.\\xa0 We’re a humanitarian cop.\\xa0 We help — it’s like the ships.\\xa0 Do you think we wanted to take two big ships into our country that have obvious problems?\\xa0 And you know the problems I’m talking about.\\xa0 So I have a decision to make: Do I take them in or do I save lives?\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 Do I take them in or do I save?\\xa0 I decided to take them in.\\n\\nAnd we have tremendous protection.\\xa0 We have great doctors there to help the people.\\xa0 They had four or five people that died.\\xa0 That was as of last night.\\xa0 They died on the ships.\\xa0 We took care of it.\\xa0 And now the people are in the process of — and many are already back in Canada, they’re back in the UK — United Kingdom.\\xa0 And many of them were American citizens.\\xa0 Some were very sick.\\xa0 We’re taking care of the sick people.\\xa0 We’re testing all of the others very, very carefully — very, very carefully.\\xa0 They are being tested like you wouldn’t believe.\\xa0 And we solve a humanitarian catastrophe.\\xa0 You know why?\\xa0 Because nobody else would take the ships.\\xa0 Nobody else would take them.\\xa0 So we docked him in, I think, Fort Lauderdale.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I think some people are wondering why you don’t say “We’re the federal government and there’s a shortage of masks and other things and —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We do say that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — we’re going to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We do say that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — sign off on every single shipment–\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We say we’re — we say and use the Act.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — that needs to go to places where it needs to go.”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Excuse me, we do say that and we use the Act.\\xa0 And we’ve used it a number of times very powerfully.\\xa0 And a lot of times, we don’t have to use it, because we say, “We’re going to use it if you don’t do this or that.”\\n\\nAnd then we also have companies that act incredibly well.\\xa0 We have plenty of them — mostly them.\\xa0 But we’ve used the Act very powerfully.\\xa0 And a lot of times, you don’t have to exercise the Act; all you have to do is tell them, “Look, if you don’t do this, we’re going to use the Act.”\\n\\nAnd we’ve done a good job with it — maybe a great job.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, there are news reports that you want to sign the stimulus checks that are going out here in several months.\\xa0 Is that right?\\xa0 Do you want to sign those checks?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 Me sign?\\xa0 No.\\xa0 There’s millions of checks.\\xa0 I’m going to sign them?\\xa0 No.\\xa0 It’s a Trump administration initiative.\\xa0 But do I want to sign them?\\xa0 No.\\n\\nThe people are getting — the people are getting their money.\\xa0 There’s a lot of stimulus going in a lot of different ways.\\xa0 There’s also stimulus going for companies that would — if it weren’t our government, would not — and some companies that were very strong a month ago.\\n\\nAgain, we had the strongest economy in the world.\\xa0 We had our best ever.\\xa0 We had probably the best economy in the history of the world, bigger than China, bigger than anybody.\\xa0 And one day, we have to say, “Close it up.\\xa0 Stop.\\xa0 Everybody go home.”\\xa0 And you know what?\\xa0 That’s pretty tough to do that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 That’s another thing — that there are rumors that these checks may not go out for another four months, like if you don’t have a direct deposit.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 All I can tell you is the small business today is — we’re way ahead of schedule.\\xa0 There is a problem where — and — which I pointed out; I said, “You shouldn’t do it this way” — with unemployment, where 40-year-old equipment by the states.\\xa0 We’re sending the money to the states.\\xa0 Once the money is sent to the states, then the states, whether they’re Republican or Democrat, have to get the money out to the people.\\xa0 Hopefully they’ll be able to do it.\\n\\nBut many of those states have 40-year-old computers.\\xa0 I don’t know that they’re equipped.\\xa0 I wanted to give them money direct, if that’s what you’re talking about.\\xa0 I wanted to give the money out direct.\\xa0 It would have been much easier.\\xa0 But the Democrats and some people, said, “No, let’s do it the complicated way.”\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m talking more about the stimulus checks.\\xa0 The — like —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 All right, well, I was talking about —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — when will people get their money?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Excuse me, I was talking about both.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 When will people get that money?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, they’ll get it.\\xa0 They will.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 I’d like to ask questions, both for myself and some of the other reporters who aren’t in the room, social distancing.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 First of all — and this is for yourself and Dr. Birx: What percentage of the population do we suspect to be asymptomatic at this point?\\xa0 Is there a way to figure that out?\\xa0 It seems like the antibody test might be able to assist in determining that number.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, Deborah.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yeah, thank you.\\xa0 So while we’re working diligently in the midst of the crisis to make sure that the healthcare workers and everyone who is sick gets provided for, at the same time, we’re working on tests and assays that will be critical for surveillance, and at the same time, working on plans for what we need to do as this moves through the population and we get on the downside, where we’re sort of — we’re not there yet.\\xa0 And hopefully most of the states will — say, like California and Washington.\\xa0 And then what we need to do to be prepared for fall.\\n\\nSo all three of those things are happening simultaneously, and there’s people working on each one of those work streams.\\n\\nThe antibody piece is critical, as you described, because at this time, we can’t — if we have — let’s say asymptomatic status is inversely — symptomatic status is inversely related to age, and so the younger you are, the more likely you are to be asymptomatic: We have to know that because we have to know how many people have actually become infected.\\n\\nSo when we talked, about five days ago — I think on Monday — I called on universities to work on an ELISA-based test to test for their health workers and really get through that.\\n\\nAt the same time, the private sector is working on tests.\\xa0 And what do we want those tests to be?\\xa0 We want those tests to be like what we use for HIV and malaria — finger prick onto a cassette.\\xa0 You get a line if you’re positive and you get a control line.\\xa0 Negative, the line isn’t there and there’s the control line.\\xa0 That’s what — that’s our dream assay, because it’s a finger prick.\\n\\nIn the meantime, we’re not waiting.\\xa0 I mean, we’re pushing for that.\\xa0 At the same time, we’re asking to develop an assay — the ELISA-based assay, which requires a tube of blood.\\xa0 And that’s why we’re also talking about could we use dried blood spots.\\n\\nWe also put out a call directly out to the military, because of the Roosevelt, to really test all of the sailors on the Roosevelt with an antibody test to get to this critical issue of asymptomatic and already preexisting antibody.\\xa0 That would be — if the first responders knew they already had had it, and they had protective antibody.\\xa0 If the nurses knew, the doctors knew, if your schoolteacher knew, then it’s a very different dialogue.\\xa0 So we understand the importance of that and we understand how important it is in relationship to understanding this epidemic.\\n\\nOne other comment, because I know we’re always saying, “Who knew what, when?”\\xa0 I just want to make clear: There’s 150-plus countries working on this collectively together.\\xa0 It’s devastating for every single country.\\xa0 When we get through this, we can go back and look at what happened, where, and what does this epidemic look like.\\xa0 And when you get through it, then you can validate every model there is known to man.\\xa0 When you’re in the middle of it, you have to concentrate on serving the needs of each American, and what that need looks like.\\n\\nAt the same time, you have these other work streams on surveillance, and how to be prepared, both scientifically and therapeutically and vaccine-wise, for the next fall, if it happens again.\\n\\nSo I think these things are happening together, but I just want us to really concentrate on the fact that, all around the globe, country after country is dealing with this.\\xa0 And we can talk about, “Why didn’t Italy do something, or Spain do something, or Germany do something?”\\xa0 Or we can really say, “Right now, we all can we can do something.”\\xa0 We can do the social distancing and all of the pieces that we know is starting to work around the globe in country after country.\\n\\nAnd then, when we get through all of this, we can ask the questions about, “Could we have done some piece of this better as a global community?”\\n\\nI will remind you that on February 3rd, the head of the WHO said there was no reason to ever do a travel ban.\\xa0 You know, it wasn’t until January 14th that we knew that there was human-to-human transmission.\\xa0 Remember —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Birx, the President was saying this was going to go away.\\xa0 It’s April.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It is going to go away.\\xa0 It is going away.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The President — But, Mr. President, you said it was going to go away in April.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s going — I didn’t say a date.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You said, “When it warmed up in April…”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I said it’s going away and it is going away.\\n\\nOkay, are you —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Birx —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But — if I’m —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, that was a good answer to your question.\\xa0 No, no, no.\\xa0 No, no.\\xa0 No more.\\xa0 That was a long, but a very good answer.\\xa0 That was enough for you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I have a question on the insurance (inaudible) coverage.\\xa0 Mr. President, on the insurance coverage for treatment, the way your government is going is trying to make sure that people are covered on the treatment for COVID —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0Yeah, we’re going to do that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Does that include the 11 million people who are in this country illegally?\\xa0 Are they going to be covered as well?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’ll be talking about that at a different time.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\xa0 Go head.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, Mr. President, will you release — authorize the release of the underlying data for the conclusion of the 100,000 to 240,000 people succumbing?\\xa0 Perhaps, Dr. Birx, can talk —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, that’s up to Dr. Birx.\\xa0 You’ll decide as to when —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 We can release all of the — I —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Some disease experts have expressed concern that they haven’t seen the underlying data.\\xa0 They’re not questioning —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m sure they’ll talk to you about that, and Dr. Fauci too.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 This is for you and Secretary Azar.\\xa0 Ten million people say they’ve lost their jobs in the past two weeks.\\xa0 So how is this stimulus money for free treatment going to absorb the new numbers of uninsured and —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, if you want — go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — would it not be easier to reopen the Obamacare markets or expand Medicaid?\\n\\nSECRETARY AZAR:\\xa0 So for an individual who had employer insurance — that’s what I mentioned in my remarks — if you were employed and had insurance through your employer, and you’ve now lost your job and lost that insurance, you now do have a special enrollment period where you may enroll in the individual exchanges of the Affordable Care Act.\\xa0 So that’s — that’s existing law.\\n\\nThen, what we’re doing is taking from that hundred billion dollars to providers, taking money and saying: “If you’re a provider and you care for anybody who is uninsured, we’re going to compensate you for doing that, and we’re going to compensate you at the Medicare reimbursement rates, and you are not allowed to bill that uninsured individual anything.”\\n\\nSo, in many respects, it’s better for those uninsured individuals.\\xa0 They’re going to get first-dollar coverage, they’re going to get care in the United States, and the provider is going to be made whole from this program.\\xa0 So it’s really an unprecedented — what President Trump is doing here with this money is an unprecedented, disease-specific support of care for individuals to make sure that people get treatment.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Will someone still be billed if they test negative?\\xa0 Or what about non-COVID conditions?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, I just have a couple of questions about supplies — one specifically on New York and the question of ventilators.\\xa0 Governor Cuomo is saying that New York may be days away from running out of ventilators.\\xa0 Can you assure New York that, going into next week, that they’re going to have the ventilators that they’re going to need?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, they should’ve had more ventilators at the time.\\xa0 They should have had more ventilators.\\xa0 They were totally under serviced.\\xa0 We are trying to do — we’re doing our best for New York.\\xa0 You know, we have — we have states, we have a lot of states.\\xa0 We have territories too.\\xa0 But we have a lot of states that have to be taken care of, some much more so than others.\\n\\nWe’ve worked very well with the governor.\\xa0 We happen to think that he’s well served with ventilators.\\xa0 We’re going to find out, but we have other states to take care of.\\xa0 We have a big problem in Louisiana, we have a big problem in Michigan, we have a big problem in seven other really strong hotspots, but we’re doing the best we can.\\xa0 I wish they did the original orders three years ago.\\xa0 They would’ve had all the ventilators they needed.\\xa0 Although even then they wouldn’t because if you look at what the original request was from New York, it was far greater than anybody ever heard.\\xa0 And we’ve — we’ve supplied a lot.\\xa0 I told you, we supplied some just today to New York, and we supplied some yesterday to New York City.\\n\\nDid you have one in the back?\\xa0 Yeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, if I can say — this is why the question about the stockpile that was asked earlier is so important.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t think that was the question (inaudible).\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No, it was a very important question because what Jared Kushner said yesterday is that the federal stockpile is for use by the federal government, not for the states to have access to.\\xa0 So you seem to be saying different.\\xa0 So did Jared Kushner misspeak yesterday?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no, he didn’t — he didn’t misspeak.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is that federal stockpile available to the states?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He used the word “our.”\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 “Our” — “our” is referring to our country.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, but he said — he said it’s not for the states to use.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The states, to the best of my knowledge and to the best of your knowledge, are a part of our country.\\xa0 We are taking what is in the federal stockpile and we are helping states all over the country.\\xa0 But we also want to keep some because when that surge comes, when you hit those peaks, we’re going to need it.\\xa0 And we have to be able to have the flexibility to take those ventilators and bring them to Louisiana, New York, Detroit, different places.\\xa0 That’s all.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But you will be using them for the states that need them?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, of course.\\xa0 We’re not using them anywhere else.\\xa0 We’re not going to be using them, Jon, anywhere else.\\xa0 But we want the flexibility because, you know, we don’t even know when the surge is coming, but it’s coming soon and it’s going to be big, and some areas won’t have it.\\n\\nSome areas will be pleasantly surprised, just like we’ve been.\\xa0 You look at the chart.\\xa0 States that I thought would have been maybe a disaster turned out to be — really, they’ve done a great job.\\xa0 Some states are really troubled, but you don’t know.\\xa0 You don’t know.\\xa0 We have great flexibility.\\n\\nI would have preferred giving them all out.\\xa0 We’d have nothing.\\xa0 And now when we have a surge, we can’t get them back from where we gave them because it’s very tough to take it back.\\xa0 So we have tremendous flexibility.\\xa0 And it could be New York.\\xa0 It could be Louisiana.\\xa0 Those are two that are really rough.\\xa0 New Jersey is very rough.\\xa0 And they’ve done a very good job in New Jersey, but New Jersey is very rough.\\n\\nGo ahead, please, in the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, the question or — the question is about the CDC guidelines.\\xa0 I know that they changed over time from February and there is —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0The guidelines relative to which — the masks?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 For instance, social distancing and the number of people who can gather in a group and so on.\\xa0 And now we have this — this measure about wearing masks.\\xa0 And I know you told Steve about why you don’t want to wear a mask, but I’m just wondering if you can tell us more about why, because it would set —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m just don’t choose to.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — an example.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They’re not mandatory guidelines; they’re guidelines.\\xa0 They suggest you could wear them.\\xa0 You don’t have to wear them.\\xa0 In fact, the Director is here.\\xa0 If you want to say a couple of words about it.\\xa0 You don’t — you can, if you want.\\xa0 You don’t have to.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But what I’m really (inaudible) your decision not to wear one.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But basically, it’s — it’s a voluntary thing.\\xa0 Say it, Director.\\xa0 He’s doing a good job.\\n\\nDR. REDFIELD:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 I think I just want to re-emphasize — I’ve said this before — that we’re not defenseless against this virus.\\xa0 We have a powerful tool, a powerful weapon: That is social distancing.\\xa0 And we’ve continued to embrace that with the President’s initiatives to slow the spread of coronavirus.\\n\\nWe’re constantly looking at new data.\\xa0 And as the Surgeon General said, one of the new information that became more clear to all of us is there’s a greater number of people that are asymptomatically infected than we previously thought.\\xa0 As Ambassador Birx said, that may be inversely related to age.\\xa0 And so really, the purpose here is first and foremost to embrace the social distancing.\\xa0 That’s the number one thing.\\xa0 That’s the powerful weapon.\\n\\nAnd, you know, this virus has a great weakness: It can’t jump from one person to another if it’s got to swim more than six feet.\\xa0 And this is why we really want that.\\xa0 That said, we now know that there may be individuals in signif- — areas of significant community transmission that may be asymptomatically infected.\\xa0 And we know that a face barrier can actually interrupt the number of virus particles that can go from one person to the other.\\n\\nSo as was said by the Vice President, this is — and the President — the purpose of this face covering is to be another adjunctive mitigation strategy to protect someone from spreading the virus from themselves to someone else.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And I was just tested also.\\xa0 So I assume I don’t know have the virus so I don’t have to worry about spreading it.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I want to make sure we’re clear.\\xa0 When you mentioned tariffs earlier —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — that came up in a meeting, are you considering tariffs on Saudi Arabian oil?\\xa0 And then also —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I can always consider — look, tariffs have made a tremendous amount of money for our country.\\xa0 I put them on China, I put them on other places, and other countries tariff us, and they take advantage of us and they have for many years.\\n\\nLook, countries have taken advantage of the United States for years.\\xa0 They’ve ripped us off like nobody can even believe, whether it be on — on manufacturing, whether it be on exporting, whether it be on almost anything, including military, where we provide virtually free military assistance to countries that, frankly, take advantage of us, don’t even like us.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nSo this has been going on for years. \\xa0They tariff us.\\xa0 They create artificial — you could say non-financial barriers, which are worse than financial barriers.\\xa0 You can’t sell your product, you can’t take care of our farmers, they won’t take our — and yet, they’ll take us and sell into us, and we won’t charge them anything for doing it.\\xa0 Look, they’ve taken advantage of us for years.\\n\\nTariffs are a way of evening the score.\\xa0 Tariffs are a way of just neutralizing.\\xa0 They have tariffs on us.\\xa0 And we now can put tariffs on them.\\xa0 Am I using it for oil?\\xa0 It’s something we can.\\xa0 No — am I doing it now?\\xa0 No.\\xa0 Am I thinking about imposing it as of this moment?\\xa0 No.\\xa0 But if we’re not treated fairly, it’s certainly a tool in the toolbox.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And what about with Russia?\\xa0 Are you — would you consider maybe lifting sanctions or giving some sanctions relief if they —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it would be the same thing.\\xa0 No, it would be the same thing.\\xa0 They are having a dispute — the two countries — and it’s hurting the rest of the world because it’s really hurting the energy industry.\\xa0 Russia is being hurt unbelievably badly and Saudi Arabia is being hurt unbelievably badly.\\xa0 Because oil and gas is a primary — that’s where they get most of their income.\\xa0 And this is a price like from the 1950s, all right?\\xa0 It’s a price from the 1950s.\\xa0 They are being hurt very badly.\\xa0 I think they’re going to settle their dispute pretty quickly.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Why — on the oil, why do you think you haven’t been more successful on getting them to raise the price?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Why — why do you think you haven’t been more successful in getting them to increase production in Russia and Saudi Arabia if (inaudible)?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they have increased production.\\xa0 That’s what they’ve done.\\xa0 They’ve increased it so much that there’s so — you meant the opposite.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I meant — yeah.\\xa0 Why do you think you haven’t been successful in (inaudible) increase production?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Look, look, just so — well, they’re going to stop because the market.\\xa0 Ultimately, the market is going to get them to stop.\\xa0 But they both did the opposite.\\xa0 They increased production to a level that water is right now more valuable than oil.\\xa0 Who would have ever thought, right?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You have relationships with —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You go to — you go to some of these kingdoms, water is far more valuable than oil.\\xa0 There’s so much oil.\\xa0 It’s a tribute, in a way.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But what happened is there was a lot to start off with, and then you had the virus, and it knocked the hell out of the market, it — in terms of demand.\\xa0 So there’s no demand and there’s tremendous supply.\\n\\nSo, I mean, you saw numbers where it was down to 20, and down, frankly, below 20.\\xa0 It was even below 20.\\xa0 It’s an incredible thing, the market.\\xa0 But ultimately the marketplace will take care of it.\\xa0 But I think they’re going to work out their problem fairly quickly.\\n\\nOkay, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President — thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 We’re already talking about phase four of a stimulus, right?\\xa0 But you and Pelosi and McConnell are already talking about different things that should be in it.\\xa0 Now, last time, people were telling me that the fact that you wouldn’t talk to Pelosi was an impediment and it really slowed things down.\\xa0 Are you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’d talk — if it were important to talk to her, I’d talk to her.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you going to talk to her during the —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 If it were important for the American people, I’d talk to her.\\xa0 But other than that, I can have other people talking to her.\\n\\nLook, you ready?\\xa0 Infrastructure is a great thing for me.\\xa0 I think infrastructure for this country — we have an old, broken infrastructure.\\xa0 Fifty years ago, we were the envy of the world.\\xa0 And then we spent all this money so stupidly in the Middle East.\\xa0 We spent — it’s going to be very close to $8 trillion in the Middle East.\\xa0 How stupid was that decision?\\xa0 But they spent it on that and other things.\\n\\nWe’ve got to fix our infrastructure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But Pelosi is already downplaying —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That means roads, highways, tunnels, airports, everything.\\xa0 We got to fix our infra- —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But Pelosi is already kind of downplaying —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And the beauty is because of the fact that we are so strong as a country, we’re borrowing at zero.\\xa0 We never had a chance to borrow at zero.\\xa0 Even in this country, we’d never had a chance to borrow at zero.\\xa0 We’re going borrow — this is a great time.\\n\\nSo we can fix our infrastructure, and we’ll have almost no interest costs.\\xa0 This is the time to do it.\\n\\nSteve, one more question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The death total projection that you shared with us earlier this week, are we still on the current trajectory for that?\\xa0 Or have social distancing —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Which trajec- — which one?\\xa0 I have many trajectories for many things.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The 100 — 100 to 240, 100- to 240,000.\\xa0 Are we still on that trajectory or have we made any improvements?\\xa0 Or maybe not enough time has passed?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Say — say it.\\xa0 Say it, Steve.\\xa0 What?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have we made enough improvements?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 On what?\\xa0 On what?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On social distancing.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have the models changed?\\xa0 Have the models changed?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’d have to ask Dr. Fauci, and I’d have — have to ask Deborah.\\xa0 Have the models changed?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So a lot of the projections, you can see, are based on — there’s many different ways to look at this.\\xa0 And as we discussed on Sunday, some of it is based on the current global experience.\\xa0 We are about, I think, 6.5 or 5.5 times the size of Italy, a different factor in Spain.\\xa0 And we look at all of those — what their projections are, where they are currently, and where that is going.\\xa0 And so a lot of the work is based on how this virus has moved through other populations.\\xa0 That’s a very direct way to see how the virus is impacting a population.\\n\\nThere’s also terrific models.\\xa0 And so every day and every night, one of the models that actually looks at the model related to mortality is the HealthData.org data.\\xa0 And they update it every night and you can see where we are in that projection.\\xa0 I think, in the last run of that model, they were at 93,000 or something in the model.\\n\\nNow, all of that can be changed by our behaviors.\\xa0 And so — and all of it can be changed in a different way if we don’t follow those behaviors.\\xa0 If another major metropolitan area ends up having an epidemic like the New York metro area, that could dramatically change not the model but the reality of the impact of this virus on Americans.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And where are the models on —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And, by the way, the models show hundreds of thousands of people are going to die.\\xa0 You know what I want to do?\\xa0 I want to come away under the models.\\xa0 The professionals did the models.\\xa0 I was never involved in a model, but — at least, this kind of a model.\\xa0 But you know what?\\xa0 Hundreds of thousands of people, they say, are going to die.\\xa0 I want much less than that.\\xa0 I want none, but it’s too late for that.\\xa0 But I want very few people, relative to what the models are saying.\\n\\nThose are projections.\\xa0 I hope they’re wrong.\\xa0 I hope we’re going to be under those projections.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, two questions on continuity of government.\\xa0 For —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 How come you always have two?\\xa0 Why can’t you have one?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, they’re related.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Every time, “I have three questions.\\xa0 I have two questions.”\\xa0 Can you give me one instead?\\xa0 Because we have a couple of other people.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay, I’ll go with my second one.\\xa0 The governor of Wisconsin is now talking about delaying the primary, at least not having in-person voting.\\xa0 So my question is — and I asked this a couple weeks ago; I want to see if you’ve made any progress on this.\\xa0 Looking ahead to the fall, are you taking steps to ensure that the general election will happen even if this pandemic has reemerged or hasn’t gone away?\\xa0 And —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The general election will happen on November 3rd.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And do you — are you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 In Wisconsin, what happened is I, through social media — media put out a very strong endorsement of a Republican conservative judge who’s an excellent, brilliant judge.\\xa0 He’s a justice. \\xa0And I hear what happened is his poll numbers went through the roof.\\xa0 And because of that, I think they delayed the election.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You don’t think the governor is concerned about people going to in-person voting?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 Why didn’t he do it before?\\xa0 He was doing right before the election.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But do you think every —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Excuse me.\\xa0 Why didn’t he do this two weeks ago?\\xa0 All of a sudden —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But isn’t it — because of the pandemic.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Excuse me.\\xa0 All of a sudden, an election which is taking place very soon gets delayed.\\xa0 Now, I just endorsed him today and it was a very strong endorsement.\\xa0 His polls — he’s gone very high up.\\xa0 And all of a sudden, the governor comes out — the Democrat governor, by the way — comes out and says, “Oh, we’re going to move this election.”\\xa0 So, I don’t know.\\xa0 I’m sure — I hope you’re right.\\xa0 I hope you’re right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But — but do you think every state in this country should be prepared for mail-in voting in case we’re in a situation —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, because I think a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting.\\xa0 I think people should vote with ID — voter ID.\\xa0 I think voter ID is very important.\\xa0 And the reason they don’t want voter ID is because they intend to cheat.\\n\\nWhen you get something, when you buy something, you look at your cards and credit cards and different cards — you have your picture on many of them.\\xa0 Not all of them, but on many of them.\\xa0 You should have a picture on your — on your — for voting.\\xa0 It should be called “Voter ID.”\\xa0 They should have that.\\xa0 And it shouldn’t be mail-in —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But how are you going to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Excuse me.\\xa0 It shouldn’t be mail-in voting.\\xa0 It should be: You go to a booth and you proudly display yourself.\\xa0 You don’t send it in the mail where people pick up — all sorts of bad things can happen by the time they signed that, if they sign that — if they signed that by the time it gets in and is tabulated.\\n\\nNo, it shouldn’t be mailed in.\\xa0 You should vote at the booth.\\xa0 And you should have voter ID, because when you have voter ID, that’s the real deal.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\xa0 We’ll see you tomorrow.\\n\\nEND\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\n\\n6:42 P.M.

EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Good to be with you all.\\xa0 We’re in a very critical phase of our war against the coronavirus.\\xa0 It’s vital that every American follows our guidelines on the “30 Days to Slow the Spread.”\\xa0 The sacrifices we make over the next four weeks will have countless American lives saved.\\xa0 We’re going to save a lot of American lives.\\xa0 And we’re in control of our own fate very much so.\\xa0 Maintaining social distance, practicing vigorous hygiene, and staying at home are your most effective ways to win the war and to escape danger.\\n\\nWhile you’re fighting this battle from home, we’re working with the best scientists, doctors, and researchers anywhere in the world.\\xa0 We’re racing to develop new ways to protect against the virus, as well as therapies, treatments, and ultimately a vaccine.\\xa0 And we’re making a lot of progress.\\xa0 I think, medically, a lot of progress.\\n\\nAt the same time, we’re also racing to get relief to American workers and small businesses, as you know.\\xa0 I want to remind small-business owners across America that the Paycheck Protection Program is launching tomorrow.\\xa0 Nearly $350 billion in loans will be available to small businesses, including sole proprietors.\\xa0 These loans are up to 100 percent forgivable as long as employers keep paying their workers.\\xa0 Got to take care of your workers.\\n\\nFurthermore, we want Social Security beneficiaries to know that if they are typically not required to file a tax return, they don’t have to file one in order to receive the direct cash payments that will soon be distributed to American citizens.\\xa0 The Treasury will deposit the money directly into the bank accounts.\\xa0 And don’t forget, I will always protect your Social Security, your Medicare, and your Medicaid.\\xa0 We’re protecting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and I always will.\\n\\nI’d like now to invite SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza, who’s doing a fantastic job — she’s going to be very busy in the next little while — and Secretary Steve Mnuchin to say a few words about these vital initiatives.\\xa0 And then we’ll get on to the attack of the virus itself.\\n\\nAnd please, if I might, Steve and Jovita.\\n\\nADMINISTRATOR CARRANZA:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, Secretary Mnuchin, Ivanka Trump, and all who I have been working closely with in this effort.\\xa0 Small Business is the backbone of the American economy, and the President has put the nation’s 30 million small businesses front and center in the response effort, and we are working hard to get money to them quickly.\\n\\nThis is an unprecedented effort by this administration to support small businesses, and we know that there will be challenges in the process.\\xa0 Secretary Mnuchin and I are working in tandem to ensure that feedback from our partners is being heard and implemented.\\n\\nThe private and public sector must work closely together to ensure that small businesses and their workers across the country are put first.\\xa0 This administration believes wholeheartedly that if you are a small business, you are a critical part of the economic fabric of this country.\\xa0 And your viability is critical to the economic wellbeing of your employees.\\n\\nAt SBA, we are working around the clock to support small businesses, ensuring that we are prioritizing emergency capital for small businesses that are suffering economic harm as a result of this unprecedented situation.\\n\\nThis relief will help stabilize a small business sector by providing businesses with the financial resources they need to keep their workers employed and keep up with their day-to-day operating expenses.\\n\\nToday I want to ensure that small businesses all over the country know about the Paycheck Protection Program and how they can benefit from this.\\xa0 Simply put, the Paycheck Protection Program is to help keep employees on payroll and small businesses open.\\xa0 SBA will forgive the portion of the loan that is used toward job retention and certain other expenses.\\xa0 We are working closely with lenders so that businesses can go directly to their local lenders.\\n\\nThe Paycheck Protection Program is in addition to substantial work that the SBA has and will continue to do to help small businesses, including providing advances on SBA disaster loans and forgiving existing SBA loan payments over the next six months.\\n\\nAdditional details on these critically important programs can be found at SBA.gov.\\xa0 And we will be updating these resources regularly.\\n\\nOur hearts go out to those affected by this terrible virus.\\xa0 Our communities around the country are stepping up, and we will get through this together.\\n\\nAt SBA, we know that every phone call, email, or application submitted has a small-business owner, their employees, and the communities they support around the other side.\\xa0 Our most important objective is to allow small businesses to keep their employees onboard and keep their businesses viable through this unprecedented disruption.\\n\\nI want to reiterate the importance of patience in this process as we work together to ensure that businesses are able to access needed credit.\\xa0 We will continue working around the clock, as we’ve done, with our federal and private sector partners, expanding capacity and working to make our systems as robust as possible to meet the needs.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Jovita.\\xa0 Very good.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President, thank you, Mr. Vice President, and thank you, Jovita.\\xa0 Mr. President, you’ve made it clear to us we now need to execute.\\xa0 We need to get money to small business and American workers, and that’s what we’re doing.\\n\\nThe SBA and Treasury committed to get this program up and running tomorrow.\\xa0 And when Jovita says people are working around the clock, they literally — we had both teams working until 4 o’clock in the morning and start working again today.\\n\\nWe’ve heard feedback from lenders, community banks, regional banks, and we spent the last 24 hours making this system even easier.\\n\\nSo this will be up and running tomorrow.\\xa0 I encourage all small businesses that have 500 or fewer people, please contact your lenders.\\xa0 Any FDIC institution will be able to do this; any credit union, existing SBA lenders, and fintech lenders.\\n\\nYou get the money.\\xa0 You’ll get it the same day.\\xa0 You use this to pay your workers.\\xa0 Please bring your workers back to work.\\xa0 If you’ve let them go, you have eight weeks, plus overhead.\\xa0 This is a very important program.\\n\\nI’m pleased to announce we are going to raise the interest rate on these loans — and again, the interest rate is paid for as part of the program; the borrower doesn’t have to pay this — to 1 percent.\\xa0 We had announced it was going to be 50 basis points.\\xa0 We’ve heard from some smaller community banks that their deposit costs — even though the government is borrowing at three or four basis points — this is, on average, a 90-day loan.\\xa0 To make this attractive for community banks, we’ve agreed to raise the interest rate.\\n\\nAgain, I encourage everybody: Take out the Paycheck Protection Program.\\n\\nI’m also pleased to report the economic impact payments.\\xa0 I had previously said this would take us three weeks.\\xa0 I’m pleased to report that, within two weeks, the first payments will be direct deposit into taxpayers’ account.\\n\\nAnd as the President said last night, the President authorized me to say that anybody that has Social Security recipients won’t need to file a new tax return, and we’ll have that.\\xa0 If we don’t have your direct deposit information, we’ll be putting up a web portal so that you can put that up.\\xa0 It is a very large priority.\\xa0 The President has made clear we want to get this money quickly into your hands.\\n\\nI’m also pleased to report that we continue to work closely with the Federal Reserve.\\xa0 We’re in the process of designing a new facility that we call the “Main Street” lending facility.\\xa0 We’re also looking at facilities for state governments as well.\\n\\nAnd I’m also pleased to report the employee retention credit — it’s up and running.\\xa0 The first $10,000 of wages, you get a 50 percent credit; that’s $5,000 per person.\\xa0 For everyone who’s kept someone, you can immediately get that money; you can deduct it from what you owe the IRS immediately.\\xa0 If you don’t owe us money, you’ll get a refundable tax credit.\\xa0 So that is up and running.\\n\\nI’m also pleased to report we have the program up and running.\\xa0 We’re taking applications from the airlines, from the cargo companies, and from national security companies.\\n\\nSo thank you very much, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Steve.\\xa0 For Jovita or Steve, any questions, please?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Secretary, Chase Bank sent a letter to its business clients today saying that they don’t have the necessary guidance from the SBA, from the Treasury Department, to be able to accept loan applications starting tomorrow.\\xa0 The need is clearly enormous.\\xa0 But at least one major bank says they’re not fully empowered yet to be able to help their customers.\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, as I spoke to all the CEOs yesterday — I had a conference call with them — we got very good input from them on what they needed.\\xa0 As I said, people were working until 4 o’clock.\\n\\nI believe we just put up the Federal Register with the new guidelines for lenders.\\xa0 I’ve been assured that the banks will be in the process starting tomorrow.\\n\\nNow, again, it’s going to take a little bit of time but we committed that this will be available tomorrow, and I encourage all companies go to SBA.com [SBA.gov], go to Treasury.gov.\\xa0 You can see the information you need immediately.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just to follow up with the small-business owners.\\xa0 A number of them are saying that they were on that conference call and that there’s a tremendous power struggle going on between the Treasury and SBA, and that it’s over process and forms is what they tell me; that lenders are actually opting out because they can’t make enough money to even service the loans.\\xa0 So how are you going to make sure these small-business owners get the capital they need to survive right now?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, first of all, I can assure you — Jovita is here.\\xa0 Jovita used to work for me as the Treasurer.\\xa0 There is no power struggle.\\n\\nADMINISTRATOR CARRANZA:\\xa0 No.\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Jovita and our team, as I said, worked together until 4 o’clock in the morning and started working at 7 o’clock again.\\xa0 We’ve made the form simpler.\\n\\nAnd I can assure you, at five points — I’ve told these bankers they should take all their traders and put them in the branches.\\xa0 There’ll never be another opportunity to earn five points on a 90-day government — fully government-guaranteed loan.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And those checks right into direct deposit, the IRS now saying it would take four to five months; you’re saying two weeks.\\xa0 Can you give us a solid —\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, let me be — let me be clear.\\xa0 I don’t know where you’re hearing these things.\\xa0 I told you this would be three weeks.\\xa0 I’m not committing to two weeks.\\xa0 We’re delivering on our commitments. \\xa0The IRS, which I oversee, within two weeks, the first money will be in people’s accounts.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just to follow up on that: I think the question is not about the first checks.\\xa0 For folks who have direct deposit, it sounds like those will go out pretty quickly.\\xa0 The question is then for folks who don’t have direct deposit.\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And there was a staff memo that was released by the House Ways and Means Committee today saying that that process could take up to five weeks [sic].\\xa0 That takes you to mid-August.\\xa0 Is that how long it’s going to take?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 That is not going to take five —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Or five months, I’m sorry.\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Again, let me just say, when Obama sent out these checks, it took months and months and months.\\xa0 I am assuring the American public.\\xa0 They need the money now.\\xa0 What we’re going to do is — again, if we have your information, you’ll get it in two — in — within two weeks.\\xa0 Social Security, you’ll get it very quickly after that.\\xa0 If we don’t have your information, you’ll have a simple web portal; you’ll upload it.\\xa0 If we don’t have that, we’ll send you checks in the mail.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How many checks can you process in a week, though?\\xa0 How many checks can you —\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Again, we can process a lot of checks, but we don’t want to send checks.\\xa0 In this environment, we don’t want people to get checks.\\xa0 We want to put money directly into their account.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\\xa0 This is for, I guess, both you and the Administrator.\\xa0 There have been some anecdotal reports that business people are trying to get access to the online site to submit the applications.\\xa0 The website has been crashing.\\xa0 I’ve heard of webinars going offline because there’s just too many people on them.\\xa0 So how are you guys going to be ready, you know, tomorrow to get these loans out?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 We’ve brought in a lot of external resources at SBA and us to make sure there’s additional capacity.\\xa0 As I said, we heard a lot of good feedback yesterday to simplify this process.\\xa0 It’s going to be up and running.\\n\\nNow, let me just be clear: That doesn’t mean everybody is going to get their loan tomorrow.\\xa0 But the system will be up and running.\\xa0 We encourage people over the next week, sign up.\\xa0 You can go on right now.\\xa0 You can go on the web, see what information you need.\\xa0 Very simple process.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Secretary, on a separate subject, have you been in touch with Leader McConnell and Speaker Pelosi about their differences right now about another stimulus package?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 I spoke to — I’ve spoken to the Leader, I’ve spoken to the Speaker.\\xa0 I’ve spoken to the President constantly.\\xa0 When the President is ready and thinks we should do the next stage, we’re ready.\\xa0 The President has talked about the issue of infrastructure since the campaign.\\xa0 I think you know that’s a big priority for him.\\n\\nAnd again, if we run out of money on the small-business program, we’ll be back right away to Congress to get this increased.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Does the unemployment numbers today increase the urgency of doing a phase four?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, let me just say, you know, we’re going through something that we’ve never done before, where the government has shut down big parts of the economy because of health reasons.\\xa0 Our economy was in great shape; our companies were in great shape.\\n\\nThere are three ways that Americans are going to be protected. \\xa0For small business, they’ll get paid by their business through this program.\\xa0 The direct deposit.\\xa0 There’s also enhanced unemployment.\\n\\nSo we realized, unfortunately, there are a lot of companies that, because they aren’t in business over a short period of time — again, we’re working with the states on enhanced unemployment.\\n\\nAnd as soon as the medical professionals and the President give the all clear, we’re going to have a ton of liquidity.\\xa0 We have about $6 trillion — this has never been done between us and the Fed — to put into the economy to support American workers and American business.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Secretary, in addition to the jobless numbers we saw today, phase three was signed before the social distancing guidelines were extended for another month.\\xa0 So what additional relief are you going to give to Americans as they stay out of work for all these extra weeks?\\xa0 I mean, what are you waiting for?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, we — in designing this program, we thought that we had liquidity for about 10 weeks.\\xa0 And that’s what we’ve designed.\\n\\nAnd again, I think the President’s been very clear, if we need to go back to Congress to support the American economy and American workers, we will be doing that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 Secretary Mnuchin, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has formed a Select Committee to oversee the distribution of recovery funds.\\xa0 And she says she wants to make sure that those funds are wisely and efficiently spent.\\xa0 Do you think that Select Committee is something that’s necessary?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 I don’t.\\xa0 I mean, you know, the — both parties wanted us to have oversight, wanted us to have transparency.\\xa0 We have full transparency.\\xa0 We have a oversight committee that the Speaker gets to pick someone, the Leader gets to pick someone.\\xa0 I believe there’s five people on it.\\xa0 And again, that committee will review the money that we’re spending.\\xa0 And again, we support full transparency.\\xa0 Taxpayers should understand how we’re going to support this economy and jobs.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Secretary, Senator Murkowski has asked you to consider providing loans to energy companies under the CARES Act, the phase three bill.\\xa0 What are your thoughts on that?\\xa0 Would you consider providing those loans to energy companies?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 So, thank you, and let me clarify.\\xa0 I have very limited ability to do direct loans out of the Treasury.\\xa0 I can do them for passenger airlines, cargo airlines, contractors, and national security companies.\\xa0 Outside of that, we work with the Federal Reserve to create broad-based lending facilities, which we will do so.\\n\\nSo our expectation is, the energy companies, like all our other companies, will be able to participate in broad-based facilities, whether it’s the corporate facility or whether it’s the “Main Street” facility, but not direct lending out of the Treasury.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A question for clarity about the direct payments to Americans.\\xa0 For those folks who don’t have bank accounts, who don’t have direct deposit information on file with the IRS, how long would they have to wait for their check?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, for people who don’t have direct deposit — again, we’ll have an easy way they put it up.\\xa0 We can, on a rolling basis — I think, you know, within a couple of days when they give it to us, we’ll send the money out.\\xa0 We do realize there are people who are underbanked.\\n\\nAnd again, we’re working with all the digital companies, prepaid debit cards.\\xa0 We’re working with all of them to make sure we have a process that every American gets their money quickly.\\xa0 This money does people no good if it shows up in four months.\\xa0 And we will deliver on that promise.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, “quickly” is a matter of weeks then, perhaps, not months?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 “Quickly” is a matter of weeks and not months.\\xa0 That’s correct.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Secretary, would you consider a moratorium —\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 In the back.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Secretary, one area where you can make direct loans is to the airlines.\\xa0 How much do you expect that the Treasury Department and the federal government will be involved in overseeing the operations of airlines as it pertains to which routes get cut back, how much they operate, what they do about their employees and the like?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 So there are — there are very strict requirements that’s built into the bill.\\xa0 Again, this was a bipartisan requirement.\\xa0 One, anything we do with the airlines, they have to maintain substantially all of their employees.\\xa0 So again, any money that we provide them will go to pay their employees.\\xa0 We’re going to be working with the Secretary of Transportation.\\xa0 There are requirements to maintain certain routes.\\n\\nSo again, we have a very clear process.\\xa0 We’ve hired three outside advisors who will be financial advisors, and three law firms.\\xa0 We’ll be releasing that information shortly.\\xa0 And I want to thank them.\\xa0 They’re all working for basically very, very little money.\\xa0 They couldn’t work for free, so they’ve agreed to basically work for what they would sign up to work for charitable organizations.\\n\\nSo again, no big fees to bankers.\\xa0 We’ve got a great team of three lawyers and three financial advisors that will assist us.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Secretary, just to follow up on that, will you give us a list of the names of those people who are advising you when you release the information?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Of course, we will.\\xa0 We’ll give you the names as well as the contracts.\\xa0 So again —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you have any names right now other than BlackRock?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 So, again, I’m happy to announce we have — the PJT Partners — okay? — is going to do the passenger airlines; Moelis & Company is going to do the cargo and contractors; and Perella Weinberg will handle the national security.\\xa0 And there’ll be three law firms, which we’ll announce shortly, that will be working in each one of those sectors.\\n\\nAnd, again, let me just be clear: We need to get this done quickly.\\xa0 The airlines need money.\\xa0 We’re going to work very closely with the Department of Transportation and get this done quickly.\\xa0 We’ve actually already received contracts from a lot of the people.\\xa0 Again, there’s guidance up on the web.\\xa0 Full transparency.\\xa0 We’ve asked for applications.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Secretary, on the airline issue again, you know, Speaker Pelosi and others have said that the government taking stakes in those airlines should not be a condition for the federal government to provide payroll support specifically.\\xa0 What’s your response to that?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 I spoke to the Speaker last night about that.\\xa0 This was something that was highly negotiated between the Republicans and the Democrats.\\xa0 The President was personally involved in this.\\xa0 He was on the phone with us many times.\\xa0 Mitch McConnell, Mark Meadows, senators on both sides.\\n\\nThere is a specific line in the bill that says that the Secretary, meaning me, will determine proper compensation.\\xa0 So this is not a bailout for the airlines.\\xa0 And I will be working — once we get our advice from our financial advisors, we get the applications from the airlines, I’ll be working very closely with the President, and we’ll make sure that we strike the right balance, not a bailout.\\xa0 Taxpayers get compensated.\\xa0 But these airlines — these are national security issues.\\xa0 We want to keep our airlines intact.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Secretary, just more broadly for — perhaps for the Administrator, if not for you as well.\\xa0 Some small businesses, restaurant owners, for example, are finding that laying off their employees so that they can start collecting unemployment is better both for them as business owners and for their workers.\\xa0 What incentives do they have right now to keep their employees on the payroll if no one is coming into their restaurant?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Well, the incentive that you have — and we want American business to be kept intact.\\xa0 The incentive is: These are loans that turn into grants.\\xa0 So if you’re a business owner, and you’re a restaurant, you can hire your people back, you get money for their medical.\\xa0 You keep them on the medical plan.\\xa0 You get money for your rent.\\xa0 You get money for your electricity.\\xa0 So you’re motivated.\\xa0 We want you to have a business that you can reopen quickly when it’s appropriate.\\xa0 So this doesn’t cost the business owners anything.\\n\\nYou know, when people talk about — I can’t imagine any American worker who had a job, has offered to keep their job, isn’t going to want to have it.\\xa0 And let me just be clear — we’ve also talked about this unemployment issue.\\xa0 You can only get unemployment if you don’t have a job.\\xa0 So unemployment is intended for those people that are some of the mid-size or larger businesses — and we’re very sympathetic to this — that these companies can’t afford.\\xa0 And for those people, the enhanced unemployment will be a significant benefit.\\n\\nBut we want to make sure — 50 percent of the American workforce is small businesses under 500 people.\\xa0 The President, the Vice President, the Administrator and I want to make sure this part of the economy is ready and intact when we’re ready to reopen.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A question for the Administrator, if I may.\\xa0 Is there a certain category of small businesses that you’re most concerned about?\\xa0 Restaurants, hair salons, things like that?\\n\\nADMINISTRATOR CARRANZA:\\xa0 That’s a great question.\\xa0 We’re concerned about every small business.\\xa0 There’s 30 million small businesses that we’re really focused on.\\xa0 And we’re working feverishly to make sure that we can provide the available funds to them as quickly as possible.\\n\\nSo it’s 30 million small businesses and the other businesses are being dealt with, with the PPP, with the Paycheck Protection.\\xa0 There was also the disaster — what we call it the injury — or economic injury disaster loan.\\xa0 And then there was an advance associated with that particular program as well.\\n\\nSo, to answer your question, we’re concerned about all businesses.\\xa0 And as the Secretary indicated, we’re looking at employees being ready, not lost in this process.\\xa0 We want businesses to stay intact because they represent half the — half the GDP.\\xa0 So if we spend a trillion to support 10 trillion or 11 trillion, I think that’s a significant investment, and that’s what we’re focused on.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is there a certain segment that’s particularly vulnerable?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Let me — I just want to — hang on.\\xa0 I just want to make one comment for explanation, because I want to make sure everybody out there understands this.\\xa0 If you’re an independent contractor, if you’re a sole proprietor, you’re eligible for this as well.\\xa0 Now, that program won’t be up and running until next week.\\n\\nBut again, this is a very broad definition of small business.\\xa0 So if you’re an independent plumber, if you’re an independent contractor, you’re covered under this program.\\xa0 It’s slightly more complicated; you have to come in to your bank and give them more information.\\xa0 But starting next week, that part of the program will be up and running.\\n\\nAlso, charities.\\xa0 Charities, as well.\\xa0 Very important.\\xa0 The Vice President and President made sure that we covered small charities in this.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And does that include churches and religious nonprofits?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 It does, although there are some technical issues.\\xa0 But, yes, it does include faith organizations.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is that under the under the — that’s under the SBA program?\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: \\xa0This is under the PPP.\\xa0 Yes, the new SBA program, they are covered.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 Thank you all very much.\\n\\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Thank you, everybody.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Jovita.\\xa0 Thank you, Steve.\\xa0 Great job.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nOkay, so that begins right away and they start handing out checks.\\xa0 And a lot of people are going to have their businesses built back up quickly, I hope.\\xa0 And we’ll see.\\xa0 It’s complicated, big.\\xa0 Small business is actually big business.\\xa0 So I thank them both.\\n\\nAnd please — good.\\xa0 We have some great gentlemen.\\xa0 Let me see.\\xa0 Great gentlemen.\\xa0 That’s correct.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\n\\nToday, my administration is also issuing new guidelines to protect elderly Americans who remain the most vulnerable.\\xa0 By now, nursing homes should have suspended the entry of all medically unnecessary personnel.\\n\\nToday, we’re further recommending that all nursing home facilities assign the same staff to care for the same group of residents consistently to minimize any potential spread.\\xa0 And we’re also urging facilities to designate separate areas for healthy and sick residents.\\xa0 And this is a practice that we probably will be recommending into the future, long after the enemy is gone — this particular enemy is gone.\\n\\nWe’re also making every effort to provide relief to our great veterans.\\xa0 We take very good care of our veterans.\\xa0 At my direction, Secretary Wilkie will use any authority at his disposal to extend deadlines for benefits and to postpone debt collections.\\n\\nWe’re now conducting well over 100,000 coronavirus tests per day.\\xa0 It’s over a thou- — a hundred thousand test a day –and these are accurate tests and they’re moving rapidly — which is more than any other country in the world, both in terms of the raw number and also on a per capita basis.\\xa0 The most.\\n\\nThe FDA has also authorized the first coronavirus antibody test developed by Cellex, a key step that will help identify people who have recovered and to understand their immune response and their immune system.\\n\\nMoments ago, I directed Secretary Azar and Acting Secretary Wolf to use any and all available authority under the Defense Production Act to ensure that domestic manufacturers have the supplies they need to produce ventilators for patients with severe cases of C-O-V-I-D 19.\\xa0 You know what that is, right?\\xa0 Become a very famous term: C-O-V-I-D — COVID.\\n\\nThis action will help General Electric, Hill-Rom, Medtronic, ResMed, Royal Philips, and Vyaire Medical overcome obstacles in the supply chain that threaten the rapid production of ventilators.\\xa0 We have over 100,000 being built right now, or soon to be started.\\xa0 We anticipate issuing more orders under the Defense Production Act in the very near future.\\n\\nIn addition to the one that I’ve just signed against 3M for facemasks — we just signed an element of the Act against 3M.\\xa0 And hopefully they’ll be able to do what they are supposed to do.\\xa0 I just spoke to Mary Barra of General Motors and she said they’re very soon going to be ready to start production of the ventilators.\\xa0 They have a lot of ventilators that they’ve committed to build, and they’ll be starting very, very quickly.\\n\\nFEMA continues to deliver resources to areas most affected by the virus, including New York.\\xa0 On top of the 3,000 beds we’re already providing to the Javits Center, the Department of Defense is adding another 48 ICU beds.\\n\\nGovernor Cuomo has asked that this facility go — and it’s a big, beautiful facility — it be converted to a COVID hospital.\\xa0 And we hadn’t done that yet.\\xa0 We hadn’t thought in terms of doing that.\\xa0 But their use is — their real demand is for that.\\xa0 And we had meetings on it with the task force.\\xa0 We had meetings with the military.\\xa0 And I’ve decided to say, “Yes, I’m going to do that,” that I will be signing and agreeing to a “yes” answer.\\n\\nSo that — we will be doing that, and also, we will be staffing it.\\xa0 So the federal government is doing a lot of things that wasn’t anticipated that it do.\\n\\nThis is a 2,500 — and/or 2,900 can easily be set up — hospital built in Javits Center.\\xa0 And so we’re going to be converting that to a COVID-19 hospital.\\xa0 And it’s going to be staffed by the military and by the federal government.\\n\\nAnd based on the fact that I agreed to that, we had two other facilities that were likewise asking for it, and that would be in Louisiana and also in Dallas.\\xa0 And we’ll be doing those.\\xa0 We spoke to the governor of Louisiana, spoke to the governor of Texas.\\xa0 And we’ve told them that we will be staffing those hospitals, again, above and beyond, but that’s okay.\\xa0 We have to do that.\\n\\nIn addition, the USNS Comfort is docked in New York to accept patients.\\xa0 That is a non-COVID.\\n\\nTo date, FEMA has delivered more than 4 million N95 mask respirators.\\xa0 And it’s — think of that: 4 million.\\xa0 Four million.\\n\\nDon’t forget, we’re a secondary source.\\xa0 The states are doing it and we’re backing them up.\\xa0 But we’ve gotten 4 million N95 respirators, 1.8 million surgical masks, 460,000 face shields, 1.4 million gloves, and 4,400 ventilators just to the city and to the state of New York.\\xa0 And some of them now are being sent.\\xa0 I spoke with both Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio a little while ago, and some of them are being sent to the city.\\n\\nAll of America stands with the people of New York in this time of need.\\xa0 It’s definitely a hotspot, but we have other hotspots also.\\xa0 And we’re taking them — taking care of them very, very strongly, very powerfully.\\xa0 We have the finest people in the world in those locations.\\xa0 And I think the federal government has not only acted early but acted quickly, professionally.\\xa0 There’s no people like this.\\n\\nDoctors, nurses, first responders, and other healthcare providers who want to help New York at this critical time should visit website NYC.gov/HelpNow.\\xa0 NYC.gov/HelpNow.\\xa0 They need help now.\\xa0 They need people to help them.\\n\\nWe have great facilities, and we’ve built some brand-new facilities, big ones, but we need help.\\xa0 We need help for professional people.\\xa0 So if you’re in an area that isn’t so affected and you’re a doctor, a nurse, a healthcare worker, please get to that website.\\xa0 And we would really appreciate your help.\\xa0 New York City needs it.\\xa0 Louisiana, by the way, needs it.\\xa0 Michigan needs it.\\xa0 Whatever you can do.\\xa0 Those are very strong hotspots; they need help.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, as the virus has spread and economic hardship has followed, we have seen Americans unite with incredible selflessness and compassion.\\xa0 I want to remind everyone here in our nation’s capital, especially in Congress, that this is not the time for politics, endless partisan investigations.\\n\\nHere we go again.\\xa0 Have already done extraordinary damage to our country in recent years.\\xa0 You see what happens.\\xa0 It’s witch hunt after witch hunt after witch hunt.\\xa0 And in the end, the people doing the witch hunt have been losing, and they’ve been losing by a lot.\\xa0 And it’s not any time for witch hunts.\\xa0 It’s time to get this enemy defeated.\\n\\nConducting these partisan investigations in the middle of a pandemic is a really big waste of vital resources, time, attention.\\xa0 And we want to fight for American lives, not waste time and build up my poll numbers, because that’s all they’re doing because everyone knows it’s ridiculous.\\n\\nSo we want to focus on the people of this country, even the people of the world — we’re going to be able to help them — because, right now, as an example, we’re building so many ventilators — very, very hard to build — but we’re building thousands.\\xa0 Thousands of them.\\xa0 And a lot of them will be coming at a time when we won’t need them as badly, because it takes time.\\xa0 Very complex, very expensive.\\xa0 And we’ll be able to help outside of our country.\\xa0 We think we’ll be able to help.\\xa0 That’s something that you cannot easily produce.\\n\\nAs citizens, we’re linked together by the shared bonds of national love, loyalty, and affection.\\xa0 There’s no earthly force more powerful than the patriotic pride that stirs in our hearts.\\xa0 And that is so true.\\xa0 It’s incredible the job that everybody has been doing.\\xa0 Everybody.\\xa0 They don’t sleep.\\xa0 They don’t go to bed.\\xa0 Sometimes they get nothing.\\n\\nI said to somebody recently on the task force, “How many hours’ sleep have you gotten over the last couple of days?”\\xa0 The answer was “none.”\\xa0 None.\\n\\nIn one Massachusetts neighborhood, citizens come out of their homes each night at 8 o’clock from their porches and they sing “God Bless America.”\\xa0 Others have joined in spreading from house to house, down one street, up to the next, until their little town with a spirit of patriotism, and reminding all Americans that we’re all in this together.\\xa0 We’ll fight together and we will win together.\\xa0 We’re going to win this.\\n\\nNow, what I’d like to do is — I’m going to step out.\\xa0 We have a meeting on this subject.\\xa0 And I’m going to step out just for a few moments.\\xa0 I’ll be right back.\\xa0 We’ll answer some questions.\\n\\nBut you have some very hardworking people who have done an incredible job, led by Vice President Mike Pence, head of the task force.\\xa0 And then Jared Kushner is going to say a few words.\\xa0 And Admiral Polowczyk, Peter Navarro, Dr. Birx, and myself.\\xa0 I’ll be right back.\\n\\nSo I’ll see you in a little while.\\n\\nI did take a test; it just came out.\\xa0 This is from the White House physician.\\xa0 You may have it.\\xa0 It just came out.\\xa0 I just took it this morning.\\xa0 And I took it.\\xa0 It took me literally a minute to take it.\\xa0 And it took me, I guess it was 14 or 15 minutes.\\xa0 I went to work.\\xa0 I didn’t wait for it, but he said it took 14 minutes, or something, to come up with a conclusion.\\xa0 And it said, “The President tested negative for CVOID-19.”\\xa0 So that’s the second one.\\n\\nI think I took it, really, out of curiosity to see how quickly it worked and fast it worked, and it’s a lot easier.\\xa0 I’ve done them both.\\xa0 And the second one is much more pleasant, Jeff, I can tell you that.\\xa0 Much more pleasant.\\n\\nSo I’ll be back in a little while.\\xa0 And, Mike, please take over.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you all very much.\\xa0 I’ll be right back.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today, but earlier in the day, the President convened all the key elements of our supply chain team in the Oval Office for an update on the progress that we have been making, working literally around the clock to make sure that our healthcare workers, the people on the frontlines, have the personal protective equipment and also the ventilators to be able to meet this moment.\\n\\nAnd today, you’re going to hear from the people that are literally working — working each and every day to make that happen.\\xa0 Dr. Deborah Birx is also with us.\\xa0 She’ll reflect in a few moments on the progress that we’re making analyzing the data.\\xa0 Each and every day, we’re looking county by county, state by state, consulting with governors and local health officials.\\n\\nAt the present moment, more than 1.3 million tests have been performed.\\xa0 And, as you all are aware, some 236,000 Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus, with now the losses over 5,000 Americans.\\xa0 And our hearts are with their families.\\n\\nBeyond that, we have been focusing not just on ensuring the testing is occurring but that the supplies are flowing.\\xa0 As the President just announced, he made a decision today to deploy thousands of N95 masks directly to New York City’s public hospitals.\\xa0 And our team will speak about that in just a moment.\\n\\nAnd also, the President took the unprecedented step to direct the Department of Defense to use military healthcare personnel to operate all COVID facilities at the Javits Center in New York, at the Convention Center in New Orleans, and at the Convention Center in Dallas.\\xa0 And we informed each of the governors of those states today that, at their request, we were making those military medical personnel available to operate in an all-COVID facility.\\n\\nBut we would emphasize to people in that community who believe you’ve been impacted or have contracted the coronavirus: Contact your local healthcare provider.\\xa0 We anticipate, in the New York area, that your local healthcare provider will make the decision whether you are transferred to the Javits Center.\\xa0 And in all cases, simply look to the guidance of your local governors about how best to receive the care that every American — every American is entitled to have.\\n\\nBeyond that, let me say that we have been working through FEMA’s acquisition process not only to deploy, but to gather up personal protective equipment.\\n\\nAnd, in just a few moments, you will hear from Admiral John Polowczyk about the extraordinary progress that we have made in deploying not just the Strategic National Stockpile, but also in identifying on the commercial marketplace around America and around the world, literally millions of N95 masks, surgical gowns, gloves, protective equipment.\\xa0 And at this point, we’ve distributed some 7,600 ventilators.\\xa0 And you’ll hear today specifically about the states that have received those ventilators.\\n\\nWe’re just — this team has truly acted in an inspiring way and literally is working with dozens and dozens of people at the FEMA Stabilization Task Force to make sure that we are leaving no stone unturned to find the supplies we need.\\n\\nLet me also say, today you’re going to hear from Jared Kushner, Senior Advisor to the President of the United States, but someone that the White House Coronavirus Task Force directed to work with FEMA on supply chain issues.\\xa0 And in recent weeks, he’s been leading a working group, in conjunction with FEMA, that literally has identified millions of medical supplies around the nation and around the world.\\xa0 And we’re grateful for his efforts and his leadership.\\n\\nFinally, you’ll hear from Peter Navarro, who will explain the action the President took today, using the Defense Production Act.\\n\\nBut as you hear details today about medical supplies that have been distributed, those that have been purchased, those that we’re making available, the ventilators distributed to hospitals, and those that are available, let me just remind every American that you can make a difference in ensuring that every patient has the treatment that they deserve.\\xa0 Every healthcare provider, every doctor and nurse and nurse’s assistant has the protective gear to provide the care that you would want your family to have by putting into practice the President’s “30 Days to Slow the Spread.”\\n\\nI mean, we want you to take to heart the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America, first, to protect your own health, to protect the health of your family, to protect the health of your community.\\xa0 We know so many people are asymptomatic, and people that literally don’t know they have the coronavirus but have the ability to infect others.\\xa0 We want you to put these guidelines into practice: social distancing, using a drive-through at a restaurant, washing your hands on a regular basis.\\n\\nBut as we focus today on supplies, make no mistake about it: Every American can make sure that our healthcare workers and, more importantly, Americans that are struggling with coronavirus have the equipment to support their treatment by putting these principles into practice, because the fewer Americans that contract the coronavirus, the fewer Americans will have to enter our healthcare system.\\xa0 And that’ll continue to preserve the capacity in our healthcare economy.\\n\\nSo we thank the millions of Americans who have responded in the first two days of “30 Days to Slow the Spread.”\\xa0 And I’m just absolutely confident that, in the days ahead, every American is going to do their part — for your health, your family’s health, the health of your community — and to ensure the strength and vitality of the greatest healthcare system in the world.\\n\\nWith that, let me introduce Jared Kushner to speak about the work that he’s been doing, working with FEMA on ensuring a strong supply chain to meet this moment.\\n\\nJared?\\n\\nMR. KUSHNER:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 And thank you for your great leadership on the task force, and thank you to Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci as well.\\xa0 It’s been an honor working with you these past few weeks.\\n\\nWhen the Vice President first asked me to help on the task force with different tasks, I asked the President what he expected from the task force and how I can best serve him and the task force.\\n\\nWhat the President asked is that all of the recommendations that we make be based on data.\\xa0 He wanted us to be very rigorous, to make sure that we were studying the data, collecting data.\\xa0 A lot of things in this country were happening very quickly, and we wanted to make sure that we were trying to keep updating our models and making sure that we were making informed decisions and informed recommendations to him based on the data that we were able to collect and put together.\\n\\nThe President wanted to make sure that we had the people doing the best jobs, and making sure that we had the right people focused on all the things that needed to happen to make sure that we can deliver in these unusual times for the American people.\\n\\nThe President also instructed me to make sure that I break down every barrier needed to make sure that the teams can succeed.\\xa0 This is an effort where the government is doing things that the government doesn’t normally do, where we are stretching, we’re acting very quickly.\\xa0 And the President wants to make sure that the White House is fully behind the different people running the different lines of effort to make sure that we get everything done in a speed that the President demands.\\n\\nThe President also wanted us to make sure we think outside the box, make sure we’re finding all the best thinkers in the country, making sure we’re getting all the best ideas, and that we’re doing everything possible to make sure that we can keep Americans safe, and make sure we bring a quick end to this in the best way possible, and balance all the different aspects that need to be thought of while we do this.\\n\\nThis truly is a historic challenge.\\xa0 We have not seen something like this in a very, very long time.\\xa0 But I am very confident that, by bringing innovative solutions to these hard problems, we will make progress.\\n\\nToday, we were briefing the President earlier.\\xa0 He asked me to come out and talk a little bit about what we’ve doing on the Supply Chain Task Force, which Admiral Polowczyk has been leading.\\xa0 And what he’s been very impressed by is the way that we’ve been resourceful to find product all over the world, all over the country.\\xa0 And we are finding ways to solve the different problems.\\n\\nThe President has been very, very hands on in this.\\xa0 He’s really instructed us to leave no stone unturned.\\xa0 Just this morning — very early this morning — I got a call from the President.\\xa0 He told me he was hearing from friends of his in New York that the New York public hospital system was running low on critical supply.\\xa0 He instructed me this morning.\\xa0 I called Dr. Katz, who runs the system, asked him which supply was the most supply he was nervous about.\\xa0 He told me it was the N95 masks.\\xa0 I asked what his daily burn was.\\xa0 And I basically got that number, called up Admiral Polowczyk, made sure we had the inventory.\\n\\nWe went to the President today, and earlier today, the President called Mayor de Blasio to inform him that we were going to send a month of supply to the New York public hospital system, to make sure that the workers on the frontline can rest assured that they have the N95 masks that they need to get through the next month.\\n\\nWe’ll be doing similar things with all the different public hospitals that are in the hotspot zones and making sure that we’re constantly in communications with the local communities.\\n\\nOne thing I will say, just based on data, is that we’ve been getting a lot of data from different governors and from different mayors and from different cities.\\xa0 One thing I’ve seen FEMA do very, very well, over the last week or so, is now we’re getting real-time data from a lot of cities.\\xa0 People who have requests for different products and supplies, a lot of them are doing it based on projections, which are not the realistic projections.\\xa0 The projections change every day as we see the cases, as we see the impacts of the “stop the spread” effort that this task force recommended and the President has been pushing forward.\\n\\nSo I do think that we’ll see that.\\xa0 Hopefully, there’ll be impact of that.\\xa0 And the task force has been working very hard, through the FEMA group, with Admiral Polowczyk to make sure that we’re getting the supplies to people before they run out, and making sure that we’re doing it in a proper way.\\n\\nI’d like to just introduce Admiral Polowczyk, who before coming to this — I guess still is — he’s the vice director for logistics for the Joint Staff.\\xa0 I got a call from one of the senators saying, “Well, why don’t you put a great military person in charge of the logistics and the supply chain and the Defense Production Act?”\\xa0 And I said, “Well, the President already did that.”\\xa0 This is the best man that we have in the country for supplies and logistics.\\xa0 He joined the task force 13 days ago over at FEMA, and he’s built a team — really, at the direction of the Vice President — that includes people from FEMA, OMB, the FDA, HHS, the White House, and from everywhere else.\\n\\nAnd what they’ve done\\xa0over the last 13 days has been really extraordinary.\\xa0 We’ve done things that the government has never done before, quicker than they’ve ever done it before.\\xa0 And what we’re seeing now is we found a lot of supplies in the country.\\xa0 We’ve been distributing them where we anticipate there will be needs, and also trying to make sure that we’re hitting places where there are needs.\\n\\nSo I can tell you the people on the — in the task force, they’re working day and night.\\xa0 You’ve got a lot of people in the government.\\xa0 We recognize the challenge that America faces right now.\\xa0 We know what a lot of the people on the frontlines are facing, the fear that they have that they won’t have the supplies they need.\\xa0 And our goal is to work as hard as we can to make sure that we don’t let them down.\\n\\nSo I just want to thank everybody.\\xa0\\xa0And, with that, I want to introduce Admiral Polowczyk, who’s doing an amazing job.\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Kushner, Mr.\\xa0Vice President.\\n\\nSo today I’m going to cover a couple items — a couple of — five things.\\n\\nThe first thing I’m going to talk about is resources pushed out from the federal government.\\xa0 And then I’m going to talk about this air bridge, which you may have heard about.\\xa0 I’m going to talk about data.\\xa0 As you said, we’re — Mr. Kushner is absolutely right; we’re trying to be data driven.\\xa0 And, with that, I’m going to talk a little bit about how we’re trying to expand the industrial base here to meet this challenge.\\n\\nSo the first thing I want to talk about is surgical masks.\\xa0 So we’ve all — we’ve quickly stated numbers here.\\xa0 So these — I’m about to go through several different slides to give you just scale and magnitude of federal resources that have been applied at the problem.\\n\\nSo, 27.1 million surgical masks pushed out to state governments.\\xa0 For N95 masks, 19.5 million N95 masks.\\xa0 And so, if I was — if I was in a local hospital that was running short, I would — I would look upward because the federal government has pushed out resources.\\n\\nSo for protective gloves, 22.4 million.\\xa0 22.4 million pairs of protective gloves.\\xa0 For face shields, 5.2 million face shields.\\xa0 For ventilators, we have pushed to the states more than 7,600 ventilators.\\xa0 And I think, as I was coming over here, that number has changed slightly.\\xa0 I think it’s now 7,640 given to these states — to the predominantly of these states.\\n\\nSo we wanted you to have some numbers.\\n\\nNow, as we’ve indicated, we have ventilators in the National Stockpile.\\xa0 We pushed ventilators out.\\xa0 We’re holding ventilators to put to the point of need.\\xa0 But we’re also buying ventilators, asking the industrial base who produces approximately — prior to COVID, approximately 30,000 ventilators a year.\\xa0 We are going to, over the next several months, by the end of June, work to acquire 100,000.\\n\\nAnd so, one of the — one of the tools that we’re going to — I can anticipate needing — we’ve already executed — is all of those vendors that we’re buying them from will need — potentially will need help in their supply chains with their suppliers.\\xa0 We might rate orders.\\xa0 We might help them get ahead of others in that endeavor.\\xa0 So I think Mr. Navarro is going to talk a little bit more on that later.\\n\\nSo let me talk about the air bridge.\\xa0 So it normally takes approximately 37 days to get from overseas, the product — load it, get it to the United States, and distribute it.\\xa0 That’s about 37 days.\\n\\nSo, to prime the pump, so to speak, we have lined on an air bridge to get product here faster, working with our major suppliers, as they have — as they work to fill orders to get more to healthcare workers now.\\xa0 We are working to align transportation to product.\\n\\nNow, one of the things we’re also doing is the team that works for me are scouring the globe and finding pockets of personal protective equipment that might not otherwise be in the U.S. hospital supply chain.\\xa0 That is also going on these flights.\\xa0 Six completed and a number scheduled.\\xa0 Twenty-eight flights scheduled here in the near future.\\n\\nWe’re — we are working towards — some days, we’ll have one flight, some days there might be two flights, multiple flights over the next coming days.\\xa0 These 28 or — as far as I can see, out to a couple of weeks.\\xa0 Then, again, matching product to flights to create volume in the supply chain here faster than the 37 days.\\n\\nI’m just going to leave that up as I talk about a few other items.\\xa0 So let’s talk about New York City and the public health hospitals.\\xa0 I believe they’re called New York City Health and Hospitals.\\n\\nThe President directed — as I speak, there are pallets being formed, truck being loaded.\\xa0 I gave an address in New York City here an hour or two ago.\\xa0 And one of our distributors is making that happen, and that delivery will happen tomorrow.\\n\\nOn the data front, this is almost unprecedented.\\xa0 This is a commercial supply chain with six to seven major distributors of health equipment.\\xa0 We brought them all in, and we said we need to make informed decisions, and we are going to help make informed allocation decisions.\\n\\nSo within a matter of days, feeding from their business systems — their enterprise resource-like systems — I brought onboard a tool — a supply chain tower — that the DOD was using to manage a supply chain for a very complex weapon system.\\xa0 Their data goes into a data lake.\\xa0 We have a tool to be able to use their data and see it.\\xa0 I can tell what product is coming in, what their orders are, what they’re filling, what they’re not filling, and see the volume in the supply chain, and understand what they’re doing down to the county level.\\xa0 We’re working to get it potentially down to the hospital level.\\n\\nSo this 200-and-some-odd N95 respirators, we took a look in there, in the supply chain, and we said we can’t — we have the volume to go do that.\\xa0 I called the distributor, and they’re making — they’re making that happen.\\n\\nWe anticipate, as the hotspots around the country — we anticipate these vendors, at our direction, helping them allocate product to the right place at the right time.\\n\\nSo if I can talk finally about expanding the industrial base.\\xa0 So the Vice President was at Walmart the other day, who told him, “I want to get in this game.\\xa0 How do I do that?”\\xa0 So I got the call.\\xa0 We provided them specifications.\\xa0 And now Walmart is going to have — use their suppliers to cut fabric, make gowns, sew product.\\xa0 But that’s not always the case.\\xa0 We have lots of folks that want to help.\\n\\nI believe you will see, in the coming days, the use of the Defense Production Act in creative ways to help people that are not doing this today to do it.\\n\\nWe have, essentially, leads — well, the number yesterday was 210 — I believe it probably grew today — that we are working with to find how each one of those might need help to get in the game, that’s not in the game, to increase the throughput through the healthcare market.\\n\\nAgain, the President gave me one task: Get more to our healthcare workers now.\\xa0 And I took that to heart because I have — not that I don’t need that from the President, that direction to move out — but I have family in New York.\\xa0 My sister is a nurse practitioner in a Westchester hospital, and my niece is a nurse on a Long Island hospital.\\xa0 And I have other healthcare professionals in the family.\\xa0 So I have skin in this game.\\n\\nThe President asked me to get more to the healthcare workers.\\xa0 I’m going to get more to healthcare workers.\\n\\nI’d like to hand it over to Mr. Navarro.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 (Inaudible) the 200,000 going out tomorrow —\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 The 200,000 is going out as we speak.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You might want to be very specific about that.\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 It’ll be — it’ll be delivered tomorrow.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I ask a question?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Let me — let me be clear on that, if I can.\\xa0 What Jared announced, what the Admiral just unpacked is that pallets are being loaded right now to send 200,000 N95 masks —\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 N95 respirators.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — to New York City to the public health hospitals.\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCYZK:\\xa0 To the public health warehouse in New York City.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 To all the healthcare workers: Help is on the way.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Based on the tools and the data you have available to you, where is the logjam?\\xa0 Where has it been?\\xa0 How have you identified that?\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCYZK:\\xa0 I think —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Because as you say all this — when we have millions more PPEs going out the door, as you well know, the frontline medical workers are not getting it.\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCYZK:\\xa0 So I would answer you — I would answer you this way:\\xa0We put up a lot of numbers.\\xa0 I said that if you’re not a — you’re in a hospital and you’re not seeing PPE, I would look up to the state level first.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But we aren’t —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 We’ve hearing from governors, sir, saying they can’t get the medical equipment that they need.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And the reason for that is because, according to governors and also by the fact that we haven’t seen any numbers up there about what is going to the private sector, can you tell us what percentage of the supplies on these large cargo planes are going to private companies versus FEMA, versus the states?\\xa0 Is it 80 percent?\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCYZK:\\xa0 So FEMA is — so this product that we’re moving is primarily commercial product that would enter the commercial system and be distributed through financial business transactions between hospitals and these distributors.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, just to clarify that, that explains why states say they’re bidding like they’re on eBay, because the supplies are going to the private sector and then they have to go there to get the supplies.\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCYZK:\\xa0 That’s normally how things –that’s normally how things work, right?\\xa0 So I’m not here to disrupt a supply chain and say — look, these six distributors — six, seven — they have six to seven hundred warehouses.\\xa0 They have trucks to go to the hospital door every day.\\xa0 We’re bringing product in.\\xa0 They’re filling orders for hospitals, nursing homes, like normal.\\xa0 I’m putting volume into that system.\\n\\nI would say that we have the data now at last — so we put together this data element over the last, you know, what?\\xa0 Thirteen days?\\xa0 Get the people in, look at the problem, build this.\\xa0 I am now seeing truth about what’s in the supply chain.\\xa0 And I would say that there’s been some abnormal behavior.\\n\\nOkay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 Thank you, Admiral.\\xa0 House Oversight Committee Democrats say that FEMA officials told them that the ventilators that the government has ordered won’t be ready until June, which is well after the expected peak.\\xa0 Will the Defense Production Act memo signed today do anything to speed that up?\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 Yes, it will.\\xa0 Mr. Navarro will talk about that.\\xa0 We’re on line to receive several thousand ventilators in the month of April and several thousand more ventilators in the month of May, ramping up to a big number in June.\\n\\nAgain, going from, you know, an industry that produces about 30 annum — 30,000 annum to a — to a very big number.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Admiral, are you confident that this system means the states with the greatest need are getting the supplies?\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 Yeah, so —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Because a lot of governors are saying that they can’t get what they need and different states have more pressing urgency, obviously, depending on the caseload.\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 So we marry up — we’re marrying up where CDC — where the demand for COVID is to what’s in the commercial system.\\xa0 We’re providing that to these — to the commercial system.\\xa0 And we are making allocations to those of most pressing need.\\n\\nThirteen days — we now have the data.\\xa0 We now can make informed decisions.\\xa0 And so all of the “I need, I need, I need,” I now know the volume that has been happening and needs to be happening.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, Admiral, with that — and, Mr. President, I’d love for you to weigh on —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — weigh in on this as well.\\xa0 You talk about — well, you alluded to the fact there is possibly some shady business going on, that the product is here in the United States and —\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 And coming here.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, and it is coming here.\\xa0 It’s coming from China.\\xa0 It’s in warehouses.\\xa0 It’s being made here in the United States.\\xa0 It’s in warehouses.\\xa0 But it’s going to the highest bidder.\\xa0 So what can be done to keep those products here in the United States, not go overseas where companies are making a lot of money, and —\\n\\nREAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 I’m going to let Mr. Navarro talk about that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and get it distributed to the most critical places here in the U.S.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 Peter, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I would love to hear — how is that being done?\\xa0 Because doctors — I’ve talked to surgeons —\\n\\nMR. NAVRRRO:\\xa0 That’s great.\\xa0 Great — great question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — on a regular basis.\\n\\nMR. NAVRRRO:\\xa0 Let me — let me give you the — the bigger view of the DPA, and we’ll directly address that.\\n\\nWhat we have, essentially, is a nation at war.\\xa0 We have a wartime President standing behind me.\\xa0 The Defense Production Act is one of the most powerful weapons this administration can use to fight the invisible enemy of the virus.\\n\\nWhen I spoke with you last week, I explained the three points of the compass DPA can be used to hit.\\xa0 The first one is mobilization of the industrial base.\\xa0 This can involve things like repurposing from, say, a distiller, like Pernod Ricard — from liquor to hand sanitizer.\\xa0 It can also involve expansion of production, which is having Honeywell — which makes N95 masks — opened a new factory in Smithfield, Rhode Island.\\n\\nWith respect to the second point in the compass — allocation of resources — we have two issues there.\\xa0 If you look at the manufacturer itself, what you want to make sure is that the supply chain, which can go seven-tiers deep, has enough components in that supply chain so we can actually make what we need.\\xa0 And then once it’s made, you also want to make sure that it goes to the right — right people.\\n\\nAnd then the third point of the compass, which — which addresses what you’re talking about, is basically — “bust ‘em,” I call it — hoarding of critical or threatened material.\\n\\nSo let me walk through what — what the President did today in terms of a strong action and what we’ve done with the DPA across those three points.\\n\\nThe first order that President Trump signed was vigorous, swift.\\xa0 It was the GM order, which directed GM to make ventilators in Kokomo, Indiana, in Trump time — which is to say “as fast as possible.”\\n\\nAs the President mentioned, he’d spoke to Mary Barra today, the CEO of GM.\\xa0 That is moving forward at the same time as the Ford project is moving forward in Rawsonville, Michigan.\\n\\nAnd I’ve issued a challenge to those two companies à la “Ford v Ferrari” — this is Ford versus GM.\\xa0 Let’s see who gets those ventilators out first.\\n\\nNow, the second point of the compass, which these two orders address today, is this allocation of resource issues.\\xa0 The ventilator companies themselves expressed concern that in this rush to build ventilators, there would be pressure on that supply chain.\\xa0 So what they requested that we do and the President do is to use the DPA to give this gentleman here — who’s one of the strongest gentlemen in the world, in terms of applying things — is to give him the ability to prioritize that supply chain for those ventilator manufacturers.\\xa0 And he will do things like give them what’s called a “DO rating” in the defense procurement, which will allow them to get what they need.\\n\\nNow, the second order, which the President signed today, has to do with the other part of the equation, which is once they make the stuff, okay, does it go to the right folks?\\xa0 And this is a 3M order.\\xa0 And, to be frank, over the last several days, we’ve had some issues making sure that all of the production that 3M does around the world — enough of it is coming back here to the right places.\\n\\nSo what’s going to happen with the signing of that order, in Trump time, is we’re going to resolve that issue with 3M probably by tomorrow, at close of business, because we can’t afford to lose days or hours or even minutes in this crisis.\\n\\nNow, the third part of the compass — this third point there — this gets to the hoarding issue.\\xa0 The President stood up here with — he’s the Commander-in-Chief, but we have a sheriff in town too, Attorney General Barr.\\xa0 And he stood up here with Attorney General Barr, and Bill Barr said, “I’m going to go out and bust them.”\\xa0 And guess what?\\xa0 Three days ago, DOJ went into a warehouse in Jersey, grabbed PPE.\\xa0 And the beauty of that — the beauty of that: It wasn’t only seized, but within hours it was turned around and given to healthcare professionals in New York and New Jersey.\\xa0 That’s a beautiful thing.\\xa0 That’s a beautiful case of using the DPA.\\n\\nNow, what’s going to happen tomorrow is the President is going to sign another order which is in the works.\\xa0 This is interesting: There is a black market springing up, which you have described, where we’re having people bid against each other.\\xa0 Brokers come in; they’re bidding and bidding on all this different PPE.\\xa0 It’s driving the price up.\\xa0 And guess what?\\xa0 You know where it’s going?\\xa0 The domestic sources here are being exported.\\n\\nWhen President Trump heard about that, he said, “That’s not going to happen anymore under my watch.”\\xa0 So tomorrow, we’re bringing that order.\\xa0 And what it’s going to do is it’s going to empower Customs and Border Protection, with the help of people like the Post Office and express mail consigners like UPS, to basically deal with that issue.\\n\\nSo we are going to crack down unmercifully.\\xa0 And I would say to the hoarders out there and the brokers that are trying to make money off of the misery of people in this country, around the world: That’s got to stop.\\xa0 And if you’ve got inventory, what you need to do is pick up a phone and not call somebody out in — around the world.\\xa0 You call FEMA and say, “We got some stuff.\\xa0 We’ll give it to you at a fair price,”\\xa0and be done with that, because that stuff has absolutely got to stop.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible.)\\n\\nMR. NAVARRO:\\xa0 So that’s — that’s — hang on.\\xa0 Hang on.\\xa0 So that’s — that’s what we’re going to be looking for.\\xa0 And when we hear cases like this, we’re going to aggressively issue order after order to crack down on it.\\n\\nNow, before — this is not my role to take a bunch of questions, but let me tell you one other thing before I leave the podium.\\xa0 It’s a story, which I’d love to share with you today because this again illustrates the key principles of this President and this Vice President, which is to wed the full force of the federal government with the full power of private enterprise.\\n\\nAnd just two days ago, we at the White House got an urgent SOS from the chief of police of the New York Police Department.\\xa0 And they are in a situation now because of the strain on their resources where personnel, such as their homicide detectives, were having to go on into houses and deal with COVID issues without protective gear.\\n\\nNow the beauty of this President is because of his leadership, we were able to solve that problem in two phone calls.\\xa0 Two phone calls.\\xa0 The first one went to Phebe Novakovic at the General Dynamics.\\xa0 “Phebe, can you call Tom Kennedy at Raytheon?\\xa0 I need you guys to basically scoop up all the Tyvek suits you can and find any gloves you can.”\\n\\nThis President, under his leadership and the voluntary efforts, and the pride and patriotism you talked about it earlier, that — we had 4,000 Tyvek suits delivered to the New York PD within 16 hours.\\xa0 That’s — that’s a new record in Trump time.\\n\\nAt the same time, a second phone call was made the Tara Engel at Pernod Ricard and Laura Lane at UPS.\\xa0 They were on the same phone call.\\xa0 And I said, “Tara, Laura, we got this issue: They need hand sanitizer.”\\xa0 Literally, within two hours, we had 50-gallon drums: 6,000 gallons of hand sanitizer on a UPS truck heading up to the NYPD.\\xa0 And it probably arrived today with a promise from Pernod that they will continue to supply the NYPD throughout the course of this crisis.\\n\\nSo this is a beautiful thing that America is rallying to.\\xa0 We are becoming a stronger, more united nation.\\xa0 And I couldn’t be more proud of this President, this administration, these guys up here, who are doing a heck of a job organizing the supply chain.\\n\\nAnd my promise to you is that the President is going to use that DPA to make sure that the American people, particularly our healthcare professionals, get the PPE, the medicines, everything we need.\\n\\nSo let me — let me stop there.\\xa0 I don’t think it’s my place here to field a bunch of questions.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, you’re doing a good job.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nMR. NAVARRO:\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Navarro, what’s the status of the “Buy American” executive order?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Answer —\\n\\nMR. NAVARRO:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You go ahead.\\n\\nMR. NAVARRO:\\xa0 Okay —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Come here.\\xa0 Come here.\\xa0 Come.\\n\\nMR. NAVARRO:\\xa0 One of the — one of the things that this crisis has taught us, sir, is that we are dangerously over-dependent on a global supply chain for our medicines, like penicillin; our medical supplies, like masks; and our medical equipment, like ventilators.\\n\\nWe have — right now as we speak, over 50 countries have already imposed some forms of export restrictions in their country against the rest of the world.\\xa0 And what we’ve — what we’re learning from that is that no matter how many treaties you have, no matter how many alliances, no matter how many phone calls, when push comes to shove you run the risk, as a nation, of not having what you need.\\n\\nAnd if there’s any vindication of the President’s “Buy American, secure borders, and a strong manufacturing base” philosophy, strategy, and belief, it is this crisis — because it underscores everything that we see there.\\n\\nSo the “Buy American” order, which — which is going through process, would do a couple things.\\xa0 It would simply say, — not during this crisis, because we don’t want to disrupt anything.\\xa0 I want to be really clear about that.\\xa0 But going forward, after this is over, the VA, DOD, HHS, and this government buys American for essential medicines, our medical countermeasures, and the medical supplies and equipment we need.\\n\\nAt the same time, it will deregulate so we can get the FDA and EPA to facilitate domestic manufacturing.\\xa0 And then, innovate.\\xa0 Because the key here — the key here is having advanced manufacturing on U.S. soil that can leapfrog other countries so we don’t have to worry about competing against cheap sweatshop labor, lax environmental regulations, different tax regimes, and the massive subsidies of foreign governments who are actually directly attacking our industrial base.\\n\\nSo be patient with that, sir.\\xa0 It’s — the other priorities we have right now are to DPA and what the task force is doing.\\xa0 But if we learn anything from this crisis, it should be never again.\\xa0 Never again should we have to depend on the rest of the world for our essential medicines and countermeasures.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And, by the way, we’ve cut them out also, to be honest.\\xa0 We’ve stopped orders going from certain places.\\xa0 And in a couple of places — like, we had a big order going to Italy on important outfits and some ventilators, and it was going to Italy.\\xa0 They made the order a long time ago.\\xa0 And I said, “You got to let it go.”\\xa0 They had an order.\\xa0 And I could have cut it, under the Act.\\xa0 I could have cut it.\\xa0 I said, “Nope, you can’t do that.\\xa0 You got to let it go.”\\xa0 You know, they have big problems.\\n\\nWe had an order going to Spain, and I said, “Let it go.”\\xa0 I could have stopped it.\\xa0 I said, “Let it go.”\\xa0 We’re going to be fine.\\xa0 I said, “Let it go.”\\xa0 So it works that way also.\\n\\nOne other thing, as to your question: Oftentimes — and we’ve told this to the governors — Mike, we’ve been very strong on this — have — if you think there’s bidding between federal government and state, let us know and we’ll drop out immediately, or you drop out and we lower the price.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But states are bidding against each other.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0 No, no.\\xa0 If we’re bidding against each other, I said find out who it is.\\xa0 And usually, they know.\\xa0 Everyone knows.\\xa0 And we’re notified and we get notified, and we’ll either drop out or they’ll drop out.\\xa0 But we have another problem: There are 151 countries out there, beyond the states.\\xa0 There are 151 countries that have this problem.\\xa0 And they’re ordering too.\\xa0 It’s really a mess.\\n\\nNow, in a little while, the hardest thing to get are the ventilators because they’re — you know, it takes a while to build them.\\xa0 And we have a lot.\\xa0 We have thousands of them being built right now.\\xa0 In a little while, they’ll be worth about five dollars.\\xa0 But right now, they’re very valuable.\\xa0 And we’re going to have a lot of them being shipped.\\n\\nAnd, in fact, that’s why General Motors called up before — Mary.\\xa0 That’s why others called up two days ago.\\xa0 They called up that they’re all in production.\\xa0 And they’ll start — they’re starting to arrive in a week and a half.\\xa0 But there’ll be a time when we’re going to build stockpiles.\\n\\nBy the way, the states should have been building their stockpile.\\xa0 We have almost 10,000 in our stockpile.\\xa0 And we’ve been building it, and we’ve been supplying it.\\xa0 But the states should be building.\\n\\nWe’re a backup.\\xa0 We’re not an ordering clerk.\\xa0 We’re a backup.\\xa0 And we’ve done an unbelievable job.\\xa0 Like, for instance, who ever heard of a governor calling up, “Sir, can you build us a hospital of 2,500 rooms?”\\xa0 And we built it.\\xa0 “Can you build us four medical centers?”\\xa0 We built it.\\xa0 “Can you deliver a ship — a hospital ship — with 1,000 rooms?”\\xa0 And we did it.\\xa0 And we did it in Los Angeles, too.\\n\\nWe’ve been an unbelievable — we’ve done an unbelievable job — these people.\\xa0 And so — and thousands of people behind them.\\xa0 But we’re a backup.\\xa0 Ideally, those hospitals would have had all this equipment.\\xa0 Ideally, those states should have had all this equipment, and I think they will the next time.\\n\\nYou know, you heard the case where thousands of ventilators could have been had at a very inexpensive price three years ago.\\xa0 And a certain state decided not to exercise that right because they wanted to build a road or they wanted to build something else because it’s big money.\\xa0 You’re talking about — I think it was a billion dollars.\\n\\nBut you’re talking about a lot of money for something that may never happen.\\xa0 Because normally, on a ventilator — other than a pandemic or an epidemic — you wouldn’t — you wouldn’t need anything like this.\\xa0 Hospitals have three ventilators — big hospitals — and they get by with it.\\xa0 And now they want thousands.\\xa0 I mean, they want thousands of ventilators.\\xa0 You call up a governor and he’ll say, “Sir, could you send us 40,000 ventilators?”\\xa0 Nobody has ever heard of a thing like this.\\n\\nSo, they’ve done some job.\\xa0 Let me just tell you, when Secretary Mnuchin spoke, they want you to call not “.com” but SBA.gov — okay?\\xa0— for the application and for information.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 So it’s SBA — small business — SBA.gov, okay?\\xa0 If you don’t mind.\\n\\nYeah, let’s go.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 Thank you, Mr.\\xa0 President.\\xa0 I want to follow up from a question yesterday regarding, I think, your administration’s denial of the expansion of Obamacare special enrollment period in the wake of this pandemic.\\n\\nIn your own words — VP Pence gave a five-minute non-answer — but people facing this pandemic — illness and even worse — most experts say that having healthcare is critical to our nation’s health and financial wellbeing.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can you assure Americans tonight that you will reopen Obamacare marketplace so that they can be covered in this time of combined health —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re — we’re doing better than that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and financial crisis?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 No, I understand the question.\\xa0 And we’re doing better than that.\\xa0 We’re going to try and get a cash payment to the people.\\xa0 And we’re working out the mechanics of that with legislature.\\n\\nSo we’re going to try and get them a cash payment because just opening it up doesn’t help as much.\\xa0 So we’re going to work it out.\\xa0 So we’re going to try and get for that certain group of people — it’s a certain group of people — a cash payment.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I really want to ask you about masks, but I also just wanted to follow up on a couple of hanging threads there.\\xa0 On just the question earlier about the bidding, what happens though when states are bidding against each other on those markets?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they have that, and they have to work that out.\\xa0 What they should do is they should have — long before this pandemic arrived, they should have been on the open market just buying.\\xa0 There was no competition.\\xa0 You could have made a great price.\\n\\nThe states have to stock up.\\xa0 It’s like one of those things.\\xa0 They waited.\\xa0 They didn’t want to spend the money because they thought this would never happen.\\xa0 And their shelves, in some cases, were bare.\\xa0 And, by the way, in some cases they weren’t.\\xa0 They were beautifully serviced.\\xa0 They did a good job.\\xa0 But in some cases, their shelves were bare.\\n\\nSo the best thing they can do is when times become normalized — and they will, hopefully soon — and actually, you’re going to have a lot of excess material because so much is being done right now in terms of protective gear, protective outfits.\\xa0 A lot is being done.\\xa0 It’s going to be — within six months, it’s going to be sold for the right price.\\xa0 They got to stack up for the next time.\\n\\nBut we are doing that.\\xa0 And the Admiral has done a fantastic job.\\xa0 Senator Schumer wrote a letter today and he says, “You should put a military man in charge.”\\xa0 I said, “Well, Chuck, if you knew a little bit more, we have one of the most highly respected people in the military: the Admiral.”\\xa0 This is what he does too, very professionally.\\xa0 And he’s in charge.\\xa0 But Chuck didn’t know that.\\n\\nOkay.\\xa0 Jeff, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you tweeted this morning about your call with Saudi Arabia’s MBS.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 We’ve had some people say that the figures that you cited — between 10 million and 15 million barrels per day — is not what they’re agreeing to.\\xa0 Can you be more specific about what exactly they told us?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know what they’re agreeing to.\\xa0 I think they might agree to more than that.\\n\\nLook, Russia — Russia —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Did he tell you that, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 He did say that actually.\\xa0 Russia talked about 10 million barrels.\\xa0 Russia and Saudi Arabia are fighting over this.\\xa0 And as everybody knows, it’s, you know, really killing an industry; hurting Russia badly, hurting Saudi Arabia badly.\\n\\nI said, “This is an easy one.”\\xa0 It should be an easy one.\\xa0 And it may be 10 and it may be more than that.\\xa0 I was actually told it may be 10.\\xa0 As I told somebody before, it may be 10, and it may be more than that.\\xa0 Maybe it’s 15.\\xa0 Maybe it goes up to 15.\\xa0 Could be as high as 15.\\n\\nAnd, you know, there’s a tremendous oversupply right now.\\xa0 That industry was — it was over-supplied before the virus.\\xa0 And when the virus came along, they lost 35, 40 percent of the world.\\xa0 And there’s an unbelievable — you can’t get a ship now.\\xa0 Every ship is loaded to the gills, sitting out someplace in the ocean.\\xa0 They’re storage tanks.\\xa0 They’re not even ships; they’re storage tanks.\\n\\nSo it would be great for Russia, it would be great for Saudi Arabia.\\xa0 I hope they make that deal, but that’s what they told me they said —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible) 15 million be —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — they said it’s —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — enough to address the oversupply issues?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think it will be hopefully soon.\\xa0 I think hopefully they’ll announce something soon.\\xa0 Now, can a deal be broken?\\xa0 Can something happen where it doesn’t happen?\\xa0 I guess.\\xa0 In which case there’s another alternative.\\xa0 But I’d rather not see that other alternative.\\xa0 I hope they can make a deal.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What do you mean when you say the “alternative”?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They both want — I think they both want to make a deal.\\xa0 And they’re both smart.\\xa0 They love their countries.\\xa0 They want to make a deal.\\xa0 It’s good, but it’s also good for the world if they do because you save an industry.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Go ahead, in the back, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What do you by “cash payments”?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m going to let Mike, because we went over this very specifically.\\xa0 And I’ll let you talk about it, Mike, because you responded last time.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 As I said yesterday, the President has put a priority on ensuring that no American has to worry about the cost of coronavirus testing.\\xa0 And we’ve been working every day to make sure that Americans don’t have to worry about the cost of treatment.\\n\\nAnd at this point, the White House Coronavirus Task Force is working on a proposal for the President to use some of the $100 billion that we’re making available to hospitals to compensate the hospitals directly for any coronavirus treatment that they provide to uninsured Americans.\\xa0 We’re working out the details of that.\\xa0 The President will make a final decision.\\xa0 Tomorrow we expect an announcement.\\n\\nBut the President has made it very clear: We don’t want American to worry about the cost of getting a test or the cost of getting treatment.\\xa0 And we’ve expanded coverage through Medicaid.\\xa0 We’ve expanded coverage through Medicare.\\xa0 Health insurance companies around the country, including Blue Cross, just today announced that all of their members will be waiving all copayments on coronavirus treatment.\\xa0 But for those some 30-odd million uninsured Americans, the President has directed the Coronavirus Task Force to find a way to make sure that they know, we will find a way to pay for your coronavirus treatment.\\xa0 And the President will be addressing that and announcing that tomorrow.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — a point of clarification and then a follow-up question.\\xa0 Yesterday, you said that you spoke to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis before he issued his stay-at-home order.\\xa0 Did you advise him to issue that order?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, but I talked to him about it.\\xa0 And he wants to do what’s right for the people of Florida.\\xa0 He’s been a great governor.\\xa0 You could see that just by his popularity, which is extraordinary.\\xa0 We’re proud of him.\\xa0 He’s done a fantastic job and he made the decision.\\n\\nBut we spoke before he made the decision, yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And he had also said that he is considering putting people who are suspected of having coronavirus, or who have tested for positive for it, in isolation centers, and that he would potentially use —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That I haven’t heard.\\xa0 No, that I haven’t heard.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So he hasn’t consulted with you?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I haven’t heard that.\\n\\nYes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Ebony Bowden from the New York Post.\\xa0 A few hours ago, Mayor de Blasio, the mayor of New York, said that New Yorkers leaving their homes should wear masks.\\xa0 They should also wear masks when they’re with other people.\\xa0 Are you considering that kind of recommendation on a federal level?\\xa0 And if you are, how would you prevent a rush on N95 masks?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think they’re going to be coming out with regulations on that.\\xa0 And if people want to abide by them, frankly, I don’t think you — I don’t think there’ll be mandatory, because some people don’t want to do that.\\xa0 But if people wanted — as an example, on the masks, if people wanted to wear them, they can.\\xa0 If people wanted to use scarves, which they have — many people have them — they can.\\xa0 In many cases, the scarf is better; it’s thicker.\\xa0 I mean you can — if you — depending on the material, it’s thicker.\\xa0 But they can do that if they want.\\n\\nNow, a recommendation is coming out.\\xa0 We’ll see what that recommendation is, but —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is that a CDC recommendation, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But I will say this, they can pretty much decide for themselves right now.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Would that be nationwide?\\xa0 And can I also just ask–\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Nationwide.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Nationwide —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — not just for hotspots.\\n\\nAnd then, I think this is best for Dr. Birx, but we’ve heard some differing guidance here.\\xa0 The WHO and even the Surgeon General have talked about various studies that show that masks, in addition to maybe not even being helpful to protecting people, may actually increase the rates of illness because people touch the masks then they touch themselves.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about, just the evolution of —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 All right, maybe I will ask —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — your thinking on this?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — Dr. Birx.\\xa0 And you might mention that other point also.\\n\\nYeah, thanks.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 No, no, thank you.\\xa0 So I hope you got from the conference today that we’re triangulating data that we know from the case numbers, the testing numbers, the supply-chain numbers to create an integrated picture so that we can really support hospitals in their needs.\\xa0 And I think that level of granularity is really critical.\\n\\nSecondly, I just want to make the point that we really applaud the governors that are looking at a whole-of-state or a whole-of-metro approach.\\xa0 And what do I mean by that?\\xa0 The United States, going into this, had about 160,000 ventilators across the United States and another 60- to 70,000 anesthesia machines.\\xa0 That’s about five times what most of the European countries have.\\n\\nBut it’s a matter of distribution to need.\\xa0 And I really applaud the governors that are bringing together their public hospitals with their more private hospitals and their visibility across their state.\\xa0 Because what we tried to talk about yesterday is every state, every county is different.\\xa0 And that’s why we’re looking at it at that level of granularity.\\n\\nAnd as we move through this epidemic, the needs need to be very tailored to those counties and, frankly, those hospitals.\\xa0 I mean, there’s a reason why the President and Mr. Kushner have been very much involved in finding out what the public hospitals need.\\xa0 Why is that?\\xa0 Because the public hospital sometimes have the weakest supply chain because they’re often sometimes not as attractive to private sector distributors or they may be too busy caring for the needs of patients to be really on top of their order forms and their supply chains.\\n\\nSo really listening to the community that’s at the front of this fight and getting feedback from those specific communities, no matter where they are, and listening to the frontline healthcare workers, because it’s their reality that is important to all of us, whether you’re the mayor or the governor or the federal government. And if they’re saying they need something, we have to work together to supply that.\\n\\nAnd so that’s what you’re seeing with this triangulation.\\xa0 Every county will move through this differently, and that allows us to move around these vital issues that protect the frontline healthcare workers and protect the patients, through the ventilators, to make sure that the supply chain is aligned with the need as it happens.\\n\\nNow, you have to have very good data in order to be willing to work in that level of granularity.\\xa0 And that’s what we’ve been working on to really develop that level of granularity to ensure that.\\n\\nSo I just wanted to say one other thing about testing, just to give you the bottom-line data of what we’re seeing.\\xa0 We appreciate the groups who are reporting; not everyone is reporting yet.\\xa0 And this is part of us trying to understand at a very granular level.\\n\\nWe do have two states that do have 35 percent positives, and that’s New York and New Jersey.\\xa0 So that confirms very clearly that that’s a very clear and important hot zone.\\n\\nLouisiana, though, has 26 percent of their tests are positive.\\xa0 Michigan, Connecticut, Indiana, Georgia, Illinois — so that should tell you where the next hotspots are coming — are at 15 percent test positive.\\xa0 And then Colorado, D.C., Rhode Island, and Massachusetts are at 13 percent.\\n\\nThere’s a significant number of states still under 10 percent: everyone that I didn’t discuss.\\xa0 California and Washington remain steady at an 8 percent rate.\\n\\nSo what we’re seeing finally is testing improving — more testing being done; still a high level of negatives — in states without hotspots, allowing them to do more of the surveillance and containment.\\n\\nAnd then prioritizing this new rapid test kit to those areas that may not have the same amount of access — to the Indian Health Services, and to the public health institutions, and the public health and state labs so that they can use that and start forward leaning into surveillance.\\n\\nNow, we know there are people waiting for tests, and they’re waiting for tests because when these areas became very — when they got onto the logarithmic curve, we prioritized people whose decisions — where the test decision would make it critical for their care.\\xa0 And so we prioritized hospitals and we prioritized nurses and doctors and frontline workers.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Good.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So that means if you went through a drive-through or you went through your doctor, you could have that delay.\\n\\nSo, the masks. \\xa0So what I tried to give you is how we’re using data in a very granular way.\\xa0 And so there are — there is experiential data.\\xa0 When you look at communities that have oftentimes utilized masks — in general, for personal protection — from when they particularly are themselves sick and have used their mask in public.\\xa0 And we’ve looked at the rate of this COVID-19 in those populations.\\xa0 And then we’re looking at the scientific evidence to bring those two pieces together.\\n\\nLet me just say one thing though: The most important thing is the social distancing and washing your hands.\\xa0 And we don’t want people to get an artificial sense of protection, because they’re behind a mask.\\xa0 Because if they’re touching things — remember, your eyes are not in the masks. \\xa0So if you’re touching things and then touching your eyes, you’re exposing yourself in the same way.\\n\\nSo we don’t want people to feel like, “Oh, I’m wearing a mask.\\xa0 I’m protected and I’m protecting others.”\\xa0 You may be protecting others, but don’t get a false sense of security that that mask is protecting you exclusively from getting infected, because there are other ways that you can get infected because of the number of asymptomatic and mild cases that are out there.\\n\\nAnd so this worries us and that’s why the debate is continuing about the mask.\\xa0 Because we don’t want — when we’re trying to send a signal that every single person in this country needs to stay six feet away from everybody, that needs to be washing their hands constantly and know where their hands are — to send a signal that we think a mask is equivalent to those pieces.\\n\\nSo in the — when the advisory comes out, it will be an additive piece if it comes out, rather than saying, “This is a substitute for…”\\xa0 And we want to make sure everybody understands, it is not a substitute for the presidential guidelines that have already gone out, and to be absolutely clear about that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Birx, can I ask a follow up about the testing please?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Birx, there’s a lot of evidence we’re seeing — that the experts are saying that a high number of these tests could be producing false — false negatives.\\xa0 So —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Of the Roche and Abbott tests?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 That as many as one in three tests might be providing false negatives.\\xa0 And I was wondering — maybe you could explain or —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 That would be almost be impossible with —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — tell a little about the science.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 — having 35 percent positives.\\xa0 You — if that was true, you would have 100 percent positive —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you concerned about the underlying data —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 — or 66 percent positive.\\n\\nSo, what I can tell you is the number of positive tests is tracking very closely with the number of cases diagnosed.\\xa0 So, I don’t — I will look into that.\\n\\nI look at the Roche and Abbott numbers every night.\\xa0 They’re trending exactly in the same way.\\xa0 And that’s important when you’re validating data to really validate, “Does this same site” — in other words, I’m looking between testing sites to see, are there consistencies?\\xa0 Is there an anomaly?\\xa0 To make sure for what you just very specifically asked.\\xa0 So I will go back and look at it more carefully.\\xa0 I haven’t seen that kind of anomaly.\\n\\nThis is — this same platform is being used across the country, and that’s a range from what I reported: 3 percent positivity up to 35 percent positivity.\\xa0 And that range reflects also what we’re seeing with the hotspots and the number of cases.\\xa0 And, frankly –- I mean, we hate to talk about it, but it also tracks with the hospitalizations independent of diagnosis and the mortality that we’re seeing.\\xa0 So all of those pieces validate together.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There’s no concern that there might –- people might be getting a false sense of security or that we might not be seeing all of the data here on –- and who has it?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Well, I’m telling you I’m still missing 50 percent of the data from reporting.\\xa0 I have 660 tests reported in; we’ve done 1.3 million.\\xa0 So there is — and it could be those sites, so we do need to see all — the bill said you need to report.\\xa0 We’re still not receiving 100 percent of the test.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Birx, with regard to the test, the President’s sample collection took one minute, results reported back in 15 minutes.\\xa0 I realize you’re the President of the United States, but when will everyone get to take a test that works that quickly and you get results that quickly?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So, these are new tests and we have prioritized the groups that we think have the least access to testing now.\\xa0 And who do we mean by that?\\xa0 We mean the Indian Health Service — they’re often in remote areas; rural areas;\\xa0 the governors of the northwestern states that may not have the advantage of these high-throughput machines that are often across the East Coast and in high metro areas — Colorado — and then across the West Coast.\\n\\nSo we’ve prioritized the presidential 15-minute test to the Indian Health Services and public health labs so that they can support nursing home testing and other areas where we think surveillance is absolutely key.\\xa0 So at this moment they’re prioritized in that way.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s thirteen to twelve hundred.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yes, 1,200 of them are going out that way.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So do more of those tests need to be made in order for more people —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They are being made.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 So in a matter of –-\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They’re moving very quickly — it’s happening — in this case.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So I’m glad you asked that because, today, there’s 18,000 of these machines already out there.\\xa0 We’re trying to find out exactly where everyone is because you can see that gives you amazing flexibility.\\xa0 Because if people would allow it to be loaned to a state that’s in a hotspot or a state where you want to do additional surveillance, 18,000 tests, 18,000 machines, is a huge amount.\\xa0 And it really gets to your very question about how we can prioritize what we have at the same time we’re moving out what is new.\\n\\nAnd so really figuring out who should those go to, how — who can we ask communities — because these will be in the community — to share those machines into the community who need the testing now.\\xa0 And I think that’s really an incredible question that really needs to be answered over the next 24 hours.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Birx, a point of clarity about the face-covering guidance.\\xa0 You said it’s still a point of debate.\\xa0 You said — you used the phrase, “the guidance, if it comes out.”\\xa0 Is the guidance coming out, and when?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And — and when, sir?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 In the — in the days ahead.\\xa0 We’re currently working through the task force, taking the consultation advice of CDC, our top health experts, and we’ll be bringing forward the guidance from the CDC in the next several days.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Just remember it’s not a substitute for everything that we’re asking people to do.\\xa0 And just to — to everybody out there across the country: When we say no gatherings of 10, we’re looking at — we want it to be clear.\\xa0 If you have a family of 10, we don’t want you to be split up.\\xa0 But we don’t expect people to be having dinner parties, cocktail parties.\\n\\nI mean, I know you’ve seen the slope in the United States versus the slope in Italy.\\xa0 And we have to change that slope.\\xa0 We have to change the logarithmic curve that we’re on.\\xa0 We see country after country having done that.\\xa0 What it means in the United States is not everyone is doing it.\\n\\nSo we’re only as strong as every community, every county, every state, every American following the guidelines to a T.\\xa0 And I can tell by the curve and as it is today, that not every American is following it.\\xa0 And so this is really a call to action.\\xa0 We see Spain, we see Italy, we see France, we see Germany, when we see others beginning to bend their curves.\\xa0 We can bend ours, but it means everybody has to take that same responsibility as Americans.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Birx, does that mean —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, can I have a quick follow-up on oil, please?\\xa0 In your conversations with Russia and Saudi Arabia, did you have to make any concessions to get them to agree to cut their production?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Like, did you agree to cut U.S. production of oil?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, No.\\xa0 We didn’t discuss that.\\xa0 They want to do that, that’s good for their countries, and we did not discuss that now.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, NBC News has learned that the Navy is set to fire the Captain of the USS Theodore Roosevelt after he raised red flags about the COVID-19 outbreak on his ship.\\xa0 It appears as if he’s being punished for trying to save the lives of the sailors in his command.\\xa0 What’s your assessment?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, I don’t think so at all.\\xa0 But we’re going to wait a little while because I understand there’s a news conference by the Secretary of Defense about that.\\xa0 But, you know, I don’t — I don’t agree with that at all.\\xa0 Not at all.\\xa0 Not even a little bit.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, thank you.\\xa0 This morning you said, once again, that New York got off to a late start and they should have pushed harder.\\xa0 But governors and other state leaders say they rely on the federal government to assess the situation and how risky it is.\\xa0 And they want to know, how would they have known to start sooner without your guidance?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they have experts.\\xa0 And, frankly, long after, we came out and talked about it — look, how would I have known to cut off China?\\xa0 I cut off China very early.\\xa0 And if I didn’t, we would have a chart that you wouldn’t believe.\\xa0 So how would I know to do that?\\xa0 How would I know to cut off Europe?\\xa0 I cut off Europe very early.\\xa0 I mean, you have to make a decision.\\xa0 People knew that some bad things were going on, and they got off to a late start.\\xa0 And some others got off to a late start also.\\xa0 But we cut off China.\\xa0 If we didn’t cut off China, we would have been in some big trouble.\\xa0 And we cut it off.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But do —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And you know what?\\xa0 We cut it off way early.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, to follow up on the insurance point, and a separate question that came in from a colleague who can’t be in the room —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Too bad.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On the insurance point, is there going to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Who are you with?\\xa0 Who are you with?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Roll Call.\\xa0 Is there going to be an opportunity for insurance companies — if in fact hospitals are compensated for uncompensated care –-\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 Right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — are the insurance companies going to also get compensated for extraordinary expenses that they may have?\\xa0 Or are they assuming that cost?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So, we haven’t discussed it, but we’re talking to them.\\xa0 You know, getting them not to pay copays, in the case of the big ones, was a tremendous thing.\\xa0 That’s a lot of money they gave up.\\xa0 But we’re discussing that with the insurance companies.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’ll let you know.\\xa0 It’ll be pretty quickly.\\n\\nYeah, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On — I have a question on Japan, sir.\\xa0 They are expanding their entry ban to include the United States.\\xa0 Are you planning to take any similar action to ban Japanese nationals from coming to the U.S. as a result of this crisis?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re looking at a lot of things and a lot of different bans.\\xa0 We have more bans than anybody.\\xa0 We had bans when bans weren’t fashionable if you remember, right at the beginning of this administration; it was for different reasons.\\xa0 But we’ve had bans long before people thought of bans.\\n\\nWhen I did China, it had never been done before.\\xa0 I was the first one to do it.\\xa0 Remember that.\\xa0 It had never — according to what I read in all the papers, this had never been done.\\xa0 This is a terrible thing to do.\\xa0 And four weeks later, they were all saying, “We’re lucky we did it.”\\xa0 So we’re looking at it.\\xa0 No, we heard that.\\xa0 And I think it’s fine that they do that.\\xa0 They’re trying to protect their country and we have to protect our country.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President –-\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I asked you yesterday about stay-at-home orders –-\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and if that, you know, decision should be left in the hands of governors or if you’re considering telling the entire nation, “Stay at home.”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, just today, the — Georgia’s governor finally issued a stay-at-home order –-\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — saying that individuals could have been infecting people before they ever felt bad, but we didn’t know that until the last 24 hours.\\xa0 Is that ignorance, gross incompetence?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He’s a good governor, Brian Kemp.\\xa0 He’s a very good –-\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You’ve been having calls with these governors.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0 He’s a good governor and he has to make his own decision on that.\\xa0 I let the states — I think we’re about 85 percent positive on that, if you look. \\xa0I think it’s about 85 percent of the states have got the stay-at-home.\\xa0 Brian is a great governor.\\xa0 We’ll — it’s his decision.\\xa0 He made that decision.\\xa0 Ultimately, he decided to go along with it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you think it was smart decision to wait?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And they’re doing — and they’re doing well.\\xa0 And the state is doing well, in many respects.\\n\\nYeah, go ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This is another question from a colleague who couldn’t make it in today.\\xa0 From Emily Goodin at the Daily Mail.\\xa0 I had a question in regards to the Russian plane that landed at JFK with medical supplies.\\xa0 Did the United States ask Russia for this aid or is it just accepting it?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re accepting it.\\xa0 It was a very nice offer from President Putin.\\xa0 I spoke to him the other night, as I told you.\\xa0 And they had excess medical equipment, things.\\xa0 And I’ll take it.\\xa0 I’ll take it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 He just offered you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think it’s very nice.\\xa0 We’ve had some from China.\\xa0 We also help other countries.\\xa0 We like doing that.\\xa0 Like I said before, if we have excess stuff, we let it go out.\\xa0 We let some go out where, frankly, they had orders for it and I didn’t want to stop orders.\\xa0 It was a very nice gesture on behalf of President Putin.\\xa0 And I could’ve said, “No, thank you,” or I could have said, “Thank you.”\\xa0 And it was a large plane of very high-quality medical supplies.\\xa0 And I said, “I’ll take it.”\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is he offering any further aid in your conversation?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think he would, if we asked for it.\\xa0 But he was very nice.\\xa0 It was part of the call.\\xa0 He suggested — he said, “We have it.\\xa0 It’s additional.”\\xa0 They have very big difficulties with this virus also, as you know — Russia.\\xa0 I thought it was a very nice gesture on behalf of President Putin.\\xa0 I could have said, “No, I don’t want it,” or I could have said, “I’ll take it.”\\xa0 And you know what I said?\\xa0 “I’ll take it.”\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And would you accept further aid?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think so, yeah.\\xa0 If they sent things that we need, I’d take it.\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 Nice gesture.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are there concerns about Russians using it as propaganda?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m not concerned about Russian propaganda, not even a little bit.\\xa0 He offered a lot of medical high-quality stuff that I accepted.\\xa0 And that may save a lot of lives.\\xa0 I’ll take it every day.\\n\\nPlease, in the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr.\\xa0 President, you said — in January, you tweeted that you stand with the people of Iran since the beginning of your presidency and you’ll continue to stand with the people of Iran.\\n\\nGiven the fact that they’re so hard hit with the coronavirus —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, they’re very hard hit.\\xa0 They’re very hard hit.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But would you consider —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 In a lot of ways, they’re hard hit.\\xa0 They’re hit in — with their economy, with their military, and with, obviously, the virus.\\xa0 They’re very hard hit.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Would you consider easing sanctions to allow medical supplies to get in?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they haven’t even asked us to do that, okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But we know that sanctions hit the people, not the government.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You know what?\\xa0 They haven’t even asked us to do that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But how does a person —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 If they want to meet, we’d love to meet and we’d love to settle the whole thing out.\\xa0 But I doubt they’ll be —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But how does a — realistically, how does a person in Tehran pick up the phone and call you?\\xa0 I mean —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think they love America.\\xa0 I think the Iranians love America.\\xa0 I think they’d love to be free.\\xa0 I think they’d love to have just some of the things that we have.\\n\\nYou know, I remember Iran, many years ago — friends of mine were always in Iran.\\xa0 They were doing real estate deals in Iran.\\xa0 They were building beautiful buildings all over Iran.\\xa0 Apartment houses.\\xa0 It was — they were very successful.\\xa0 And then, one day, that came to an end.\\n\\nBut you know what?\\xa0 The people of Iran, they remember that.\\xa0 It was a long time ago, but not so long ago.\\xa0 And they remember it.\\xa0 And I’ll tell you, they love America.\\xa0 They love what we stand for.\\xa0 And we’re not looking for cha- — we’re not looking for government takeover, government change. \\xa0You know, this country has been through that many times.\\xa0 That doesn’t work.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So (inaudible) health of the people, would you encourage other countries to — who are maybe concerned about running afoul —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, what I did — yeah.\\xa0 What I did, as you know —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — of sanctions to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — I put it out very publicly, with respect to Iran.\\xa0 I said if they need help with respect to the virus, we’d love to send — we have the greatest medical professionals in the world.\\xa0 We’d love to send them over.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So what countries are you encouraging, perhaps, to — to lend their support?\\xa0 Because there are many countries that feel —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m not encouraging or discouraging.\\xa0 They’ve been a very hostile country.\\xa0 They made a deal that President Obama should have never made.\\xa0 It was a short-term deal giving them $150 billion, giving them $1.8 billion in cash.\\xa0 Green.\\xa0 Fill up this room five times.\\xa0 Look —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But your administration — do you have a moral responsibility to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 Not at all.\\xa0 Nobody has even asked me about it.\\xa0 I have a moral responsibility to help them if they ask.\\xa0 If they — if they needed help, I would certainly consider different things.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, the United Nations says they need help.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, that’s up to the United Nations.\\xa0 I’m talking about us.\\xa0 And what happens is, if they wanted help — because they have a very big case of virus.\\xa0 A very, very big case.\\xa0 It — one of the worst on Earth, if you believe what you’re reading.\\xa0 And I happen to believe what I see and what I know.\\xa0 And if they wanted help, we’d give them help.\\n\\nYeah.\\xa0 You had one, in the back, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, Mr. President, and a question for Jared too.\\xa0 The — you talk about a granular approach to receiving data from these different states and regions to try and figure out what they need.\\xa0 The President — you just enacted the DPA on ventilators and masks.\\xa0 Are there are signals from across the country that might indicate there are other things besides masks and ventilators that are slowly, kind of, rising in terms of need — like hand sanitizer, for instance?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nMR. KUSHNER:\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 So the first — the first issue that we’ve been dealing with was really the ventilators.\\xa0 That was the number one, number two, and number three from all the states.\\n\\nWhat we’ve been finding is that people have a lot of these requests based on the models.\\xa0 And what we’ve been trying to do over at FEMA is say to the states, “Well, if you would like ventilators, we need to see — first, look in your states.”\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 So, for example, in northern Jersey, they’re going down to southern Jersey and they’re finding ventilators and trying to relocate them to where they have their hotspots.\\n\\nThe second thing that we’ve done asked them to survey for alternative ventilators. \\xa0Dr. Birx spoke before about the anesthesia machines and the ability to — to convert them to be ventilators.\\xa0 So we’re asking people to be resourceful inside their states before they come to the federal government.\\n\\nThe third thing we’ve been asking states to do is to provide what their daily utilization rates are.\\xa0 So everyone is asking for everything.\\xa0 One congressman got a call from his local hospital saying, “I need 250 ventilators.”\\xa0 And he said, “Well, you don’t have a COVID patient within four counties, why do you want 250 ventilators?”\\xa0 And he says, “Well, we just want to be safe.\\xa0 We’re very nervous right now.”\\n\\nSo what you have all over the country is a lot of people are asking for things that they don’t necessarily need at the moment.\\xa0 And the job of FEMA and Admiral Polowczyk has been to try to make sure that we’re getting the real data from the cities, from the states, so that we can make real-time allocation decisions based on the data.\\n\\nAnd right now, what’s happening is a lot of the different cities and states are providing FEMA that — that information.\\xa0 We’re talking to them daily.\\xa0 They’re updating that information daily.\\xa0 And that’s enabling the federal government to make much more informed decisions on where they position ventilators.\\n\\nYou also have a situation where, in some states, FEMA allocated ventilators to the states.\\xa0 And you have instances where, in cities, they’re running out, but the state still has a stockpile.\\xa0 And the notion of the federal stockpile was it’s supposed to be our stockpile; it’s not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use.\\xa0 So we’re encouraging the states to make sure that they’re assessing the needs, they’re getting the data from their local — local situations, and then trying to fill it with the supplies that we’ve given them.\\n\\nThe same thing with the masks.\\xa0 So the N95 mask is actually an item that wasn’t used as frequently in the medical profession before this.\\xa0 It was used mostly for diseases.\\xa0 So speaking to a lot of the doctors and hospital administrators, they would say they used actually a very low percentage of the N95 masks.\\n\\nWhat the President and the Vice President were able to do with Congress was to get the waiver so that you could expand the pool because a lot of the masks were used to — for the construction industries.\\xa0 Now there’s a much bigger pool of masks in the country.\\xa0 There was a stockpile.\\xa0 They distributed that based on where they anticipated a lot of the need would go.\\xa0 But a lot of that still is stuck with the states and it hasn’t trickled down to the right places within the states.\\n\\nSo I would just encourage you, when you have governors saying that the federal government haven’t — hasn’t given them what they need, I would just urge you to ask them, “Well, have you looked within your state to make sure that you haven’t been able to find the resources?”\\n\\nUnlike other countries, a lot of the medical system in America is a private — it’s not a — it’s not a public, government-controlled.\\xa0 So you have to get the data from what’s in their state, look at it in that way, and then make sure that they’re being resourceful in a way to do that.\\xa0 And also ask them what their utilization percentage is because if one governor is asking for more ventilators and if the federal government sends them more than they need, the goal here is not to have ventilators sitting in a warehouse where you have another state or you have people who need them.\\n\\nSo what we’re trying to do is make informed data-driven decisions, both on ventilators, masks, any other supply we can get to make sure it’s going to the people who need them.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I wonder if you could weigh in on the reports, of which I’m sure you’re aware, where unnamed White House officials have described your role as being something of running a shadow task force.\\xa0 How do you describe your role?\\xa0 How do you describe the qualifications you bring to your role?\\n\\nMR. KUSHNER:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 I would just say very simply — look, the President asked the Vice President to run the task force.\\xa0 The Vice President asked me to assist.\\xa0 I’ve been serving really at the direction of Vice President and he’s asked me to get involved in different projects.\\n\\nThe Vice President and I speak probably sometimes 5, 10 times a day.\\xa0 But everything that I’m doing is at the direction of the Vice President.\\xa0 If some people are talking to you, that means they’re probably not informed as to what’s going on.\\xa0 But I can assure you that I’m speaking with Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci, the Vice President, and the President multiple times a day to make sure that I’m accomplishing and focusing on the objectives that the Vice President deems a priority.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Jared, a follow-up on the ventilators —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Or they don’t exist.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and the National Stockpile.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Or the sources don’t exist.\\xa0 They’re fake persons, okay?\\xa0 A lot of fake sources out there.\\xa0 They don’t exist.\\xa0 I read about it — for a long time, I’ve been reading.\\xa0 A lot of them — fakes sources.\\xa0 They don’t exist.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Jared, what triggers sending a ventilator from the National Stockpile to a state?\\xa0 In other words, how sick does somebody have to be to get one of these national ventilators?\\n\\nMR. KUSHNER:\\xa0 Well, that’s not the issue that we’re — that’s not the criteria.\\xa0 You have the states basically putting in the requests, and they’re giving us their utilization — their utilization percentages.\\xa0 So it’s a very simple formula.\\xa0 The states should know how many ventilators they have in their states.\\xa0 And, by the way, some governors you speak to or senators, they don’t know what’s in their state.\\xa0 You know, some governors I’ll speak to, and they’ll know, to the number, how many ventilators they have in their state because that’s the first thing a good manager will do.\\n\\nWhat a lot of the voters are seeing now is that when you elect somebody to be a mayor or a governor or a president, you’re trying to think about who will be a competent manager during the time of crisis.\\xa0 This is a time of crisis, and you’re seeing certain people are better managers than others.\\n\\nSo, what I would say is that, the way that the federal government is trying to allocate is they’re trying to make sure, A, you have your data, right?\\xa0 Don’t ask us for things when you know that — when you don’t know what you have in your own state just because you’re scared, you asked your medical professionals and they don’t know.\\xa0 You have to take inventory of what you have in your own state and then you have to be able to show that there’s a real need.\\n\\nAnd so we pre-positioned a lot of things because most governors, off the bat, didn’t know what they needed.\\xa0 But FEMA has a joint command with Admiral Polowczyk, Admiral Giroir, and Pete Gaynor, where every couple hours, when their requests come in, they evaluate the request, they all vote on the request.\\xa0 And then if there is something that they want to elevate to the taskforce, they bring it to the Vice President to make a recommendation.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And, Jared, if I may, you might ask Deborah to — we’re literally tracking hospitalization cases on a daily basis, interacting with governors and health systems, and that informs our supply chain decisions.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yeah, I really — I want to thank the health commissioners and all of them that have been sending hospital data.\\xa0 And I think it’s really critical and important to all of us.\\n\\nNew York City has been providing information, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and certainly Louisiana, in these hotspots.\\xa0 And that allows us — we can see where they are with the rising number of cases, where they are in their curve, what can be predicted, and really ensuring that people get what they need as they need it.\\n\\nAnd so I think many of the governors now and the health commissioners have been: “I had to use 20” — “I’m intubating 20 people a day now.\\xa0 I have enough for the\\xa0next three days.\\xa0 If that doubles…We’re seeing our hospitalization rates stabilizing, but we still think there will be this many more in the next days.”\\xa0 That’s the information that they then translate into providing the ventilators.\\n\\nSo when you see the ventilator numbers going out, they’re going out in 150s and 200s.\\xa0 Because I think, early on, we sent a big bolus out, and then not all of them, even today, have been fully utilized.\\n\\nAnd so we want to make sure every state and every hotspot can be reassured that ventilators are there for them as they move through the curve.\\xa0 And I think, to date, we’ve been able to do that.\\xa0 And I think that’s what’s important to me, is that people have what they need when they need it.\\xa0 And, to date, people who have needed ventilators have been able to get on ventilators.\\xa0 And I think that’s our goal with governors and with the mayor to make sure that that continues to happen.\\n\\nBut that means all of us have to work together.\\xa0 And I think that’s what’s been really important over the last few weeks, is people are not making generic requests anymore.\\xa0 They’re making data-driven requests because they know precisely what’s happening in their hospitals.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Birx, when you are up here a little bit ago, you talked about the curve and what you’re seeing, and you’re concerned that people are not abiding by the social distancing guidelines.\\xa0 I mean, you seemed, in your voice, to be quite concerned about that.\\xa0 Has the curve changed enough at this point, where that 100,000 to 240,000 people are likely to die?\\xa0 Has that shifted upwards at all?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 It’s just when I look at what — so we’re in week 2.2 in our guidelines.\\xa0 And I guess what I expected when the President put out guidelines that said, “Don’t go to bars.\\xa0 Don’t be in groups more than 10 people,” when we said that, now over 16 days ago, that was serious.\\xa0 And then you could see what happened subsequently and you can see the number of individuals have been infected since then.\\xa0 Because the people we’re seeing infected today and in hospitals today were infected after the guidelines went out.\\n\\nSo that’s what we’re worried about, and we’re worried about that we’re not — we’re still in this. \\xa0And that’s why the President extended it for 30 days.\\xa0 But we have to get out of this.\\xa0 We have to start seeing this.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But, Deborah, aren’t you referring to just a few states?\\xa0 Because many of those states are dead flat.\\xa0 I mean, so —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So, it’s hard to get — it’s hard to be —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 There are states that are dead flat.\\xa0 But, you know, every — what changes the curve is a new Detroit, a new Chicago, a new New Orleans, a new Colorado.\\xa0 Those change the curves because it all of a sudden spikes with the number of new cases.\\xa0 Because you have a certain projection of new cases and then a whole other city comes on top, where they’re in their logarithmic phase.\\n\\nSo those ones that I talked about that had test results greater than 13 percent positive, all of those — all of those states or all of those counties are in logarithmic phase.\\xa0 That means there are a lot of counties that aren’t, and we are really — we’re excited about those counties that have been testing and still finding quite flat.\\xa0 And hopefully, maybe Sunday or so, or sometime this weekend, we can go through all the states and the curves again so you can see where, you know, that California and Washington are still steady.\\n\\nBut we’re watching very carefully because we see that you can go from this to this very quickly.\\xa0 And what — this should not be happening any longer in new places if people are doing the social distancing, washing their hands, not getting together in large groups more than 10.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Again, so I look at the graphs all the time.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yes, you do.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And you have many, many —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — flatliners.\\xa0 I call them “flatliners.”\\xa0 I’m amazed at them.\\xa0 And you have a couple that are up.\\n\\nIt’s hard to blame the flatliners for not doing a good job.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 No, no.\\xa0 I don’t want to say that.\\xa0 No.\\xa0 I don’t — no.\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 I don’t want — in fact, I want to praise the states that — and I think I want to be able to call them out and show you their graphs so you can see.\\xa0 They’ve had steady, small cases.\\xa0 They’re testing and they’re doing a lot of testing.\\xa0 And their percent of test-positives are under 5 percent.\\xa0 I mean, we have a whole group of states who are testing and their positivity rate is under 5 percent.\\n\\nWe know what it looks like on the logarithmic curve.\\xa0 You’re in the 13 percent, then 15 percent, then 26 percent, and then 35 percent.\\xa0 That’s what we’re trying to prevent.\\xa0 And it’s the metro areas that are absolutely crucial in this.\\xa0 And so, if you’re in a metro area or you’re in a small city, please make sure all of your friends and family are following the guidelines.\\xa0 That’s the best thing we can do.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, because I saw those pens going five minutes ago.\\xa0 They were so — they were thrilled.\\xa0 And the fact is — yes, we compare them to Italy.\\xa0 One place.\\n\\nBut we have many places that are —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — really doing great.\\xa0 And I think that’s what Deborah meant.\\xa0 She didn’t mean all of them.\\xa0 So when you write your story tomorrow, maybe you’ll write it correctly.\\xa0 She was talking about one state.\\xa0 And another state is, you know, having a hard time.\\xa0 It’s — and they’re closely associated.\\n\\nAnd, by the way, the people are doing a very good job, including the people that live there.\\xa0 But when Deborah was talking about Italy, she was talking about the one, and then the other was lower.\\xa0 And then you have mostly states that have been unbelievable.\\n\\nSo she wasn’t talking about the average of everything; she was talking about an individual state, which is, I think, still better than Italy.\\xa0 Italy is having a hard time.\\xa0 By the way, Spain is having a hard time.\\xa0 France is having a hard time.\\n\\nBut our states, generally speaking, it’s like lots of different countries all over.\\xa0 We have — many of those countries are doing a phenomenal job.\\xa0 They’re really flat.\\xa0 And I think that’s what you meant.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know. \\xa0I don’t want to — I don’t want to speak for — but I thought — that’s what I understood she meant.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I ask a question about that though?\\xa0 Because coronavirus is present in all 50 states.\\xa0 You said before that you — when you implored mayors and governors to be serious about this, you said, “Once it shows up, mitigation efforts are too late.”\\n\\nSo how do you then square that with this notion that some states are doing well?\\xa0 I mean, the virus doesn’t abide by state law.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Because some states, they stay in better.\\xa0 They’re not touching.\\xa0 They’re not — whatever it is.\\xa0 They’re not going out.\\xa0 They’re not in groups.\\xa0 And some states are not probably as good, or for whatever reason.\\xa0 Or they also live a lot closer.\\xa0 You know, New York is very dense.\\n\\nAnd, you know, California is pretty dense too.\\xa0 And they’ve got a very good record going so far.\\xa0 We hope it doesn’t spike up, but it’s very flat.\\xa0 We have states that are doing incredibly well.\\xa0 I mean, when I looked at some of them, I looked at some states that I would have thought maybe wouldn’t have done as well, and they’re really flatlined.\\xa0 Hope they stay that way.\\xa0 I hope they stay that way.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Isn’t that the point, Mr. President?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Say it, Jeff.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, isn’t that the point, that you want those states to stay flatlined?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I want them — yeah, that’s what I’m saying.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I mean, it seems like you’re —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no, no.\\xa0 But when Deborah mentioned about Italy and our country, she wasn’t referring to our country; she was referring to one state.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But she’s encouraging people to do a better job of following these social distancing measures.\\xa0 That’s what I’m understanding it.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0Okay.\\xa0 So my understanding — I’m going to let her say it.\\xa0 But I think that everybody would have to be thrilled with the way most states are doing.\\xa0 Thrilled.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I don’t think she — is that what you meant?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The flat-line — the flat-line states — states that have almost no bump.\\xa0 I mean, I would think.\\xa0 Now, then you have others where, for whatever reason, they’re higher. That’s different.\\xa0 But you can’t condemn people living in a flatliner with people living in something where there’s the big bump or the bigger bump or more akin to Italy, where they have some very unique problems.\\xa0 In all fairness to Italy, they have some very unique problems.\\n\\nBut if you’d like to come up and —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So how many flat-line do we have?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 A lot of them.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And how many do we have — how many?\\xa0 How many do we have?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So, why don’t I bring you the whole deck again and we’ll divide out the states so you can see them.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’ll do it tomorrow.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Because you really have to see each state separately.\\xa0 That’s why I started with there are states where you’ve heard me talk about how concerned I was.\\xa0 These are states that before the guidelines went out or right after the guidelines went out — I mean, you can look at — it’s on the website if you go to the Healthdata.org about when governors made clarity about closing their states, as far as the social distancing, the washing of the hands, the bars, the taking — doing takeout.\\xa0 And you can line that up with the presidential guidelines.\\n\\nAnd not all states, when the presidential guidelines came out, immediately followed the presidential guidelines.\\xa0 Not all states did.\\xa0 There are states that also may have gotten many more seeds from outside communities.\\xa0 That certainly is one of the issues that New York and New Jersey, Connecticut and Rhode Island are facing.\\xa0 The virus came in from multiple places into those states.\\xa0 It was undetected early on, and they have a very logarithmic curve.\\n\\nWhat I am saying is: Even one of those curves in one county, in one city, is one curve too many.\\xa0 So I am passionate about everyone following the guidelines because of the outlier curves.\\xa0 Maybe that was a better way of putting it.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 That’s exactly —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 The outlier curves —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think that’s perfect.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 — in specific counties, is to make sure that doesn’t happen anywhere else.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So would you feel better if every state did a stay-at-home order?\\xa0 Would you feel better?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Well, I think most of the states have done that.\\xa0 I think if you — one death from this is one death too many.\\xa0 I mean, I come out of epidemics and pandemics.\\xa0 We know what to do.\\xa0 I know we don’t have a vaccine.\\xa0 And I know we don’t have a therapeutic.\\xa0 But we know what can be done, and others are doing it, and most of the people in the United States are doing it.\\xa0 It’s our communities — it’s every American that has to make these changes, and I know they’re really hard.\\n\\nAnd I know it’s hard to remember.\\xa0 I mean, I have to say to myself every day, because I’m around very important people, to like never touch anything.\\xa0 And I’m just like paranoid now about touching things.\\xa0 I’m sure you all are too.\\n\\nI mean, we’ve gotten to the place where we don’t go to your places on Pebble Beach, we go to the one that’s open aired because, I mean, you’re trying to protect your reporters.\\xa0 I mean, I understand that.\\xa0 We’re all trying to protect each other, and we all have to adapt to this new reality that we’re in right now.\\n\\nAnd I believe everybody is trying really hard, and I’m just asking them to try really, really hard for these next 28 days because they will make a tremendous difference.\\xa0 We see that evidence.\\xa0 And so it’s like having a vaccine or a therapeutic because we know what works, and we’re asking everybody to apply what works.\\xa0 And I know it takes amazing attention to detail because you know the minute you forget or do something, you’re like, “Oh, my gosh, I should have never done that.” \\xa0And that’s the level of attention it takes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If covering our faces could help us do that and guidelines are coming out —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So I just want to say — look, many states have started low and slow, and then they stayed at a good level.\\xa0 Some really stayed at a great level.\\xa0 Some — Louisiana, as an example: It was low and slow and they were looking great.\\xa0 I was watching it because, you know, it’s kind of a place people go to with Mardi Gras — which, sort of, is an interesting point, because after Mardi Gras, it was low, and then all of a sudden it went up very rapidly.\\xa0 And now it’s one of our true hotspots, right?\\n\\nCertain areas of Michigan — Detroit was — it looked like it was doing pretty good, and then all of a sudden it went up.\\xa0 So you have that too.\\n\\nBut I’ll tell you what: We have states that have been really incredible in the fact that they have kept so — so low. They have not — you haven’t seen the bump, and I hope you don’t.\\xa0 I hope you don’t.\\xa0 And you have a couple that, for a lot of different reasons — and that’s not to blame anybody, but they are at a higher level.\\xa0 But very few.\\n\\nI think, Deborah — I mean, I may say: I think most people have actually followed the presidential — you can call them whatever you want.\\xa0 I would never use the word “dictates” because if I used that word, I would be in such trouble.\\xa0 In fact, you’ll put me in trouble just that I even mentioned the thought of it.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 But we make a recommendation.\\xa0 And I think they’ve done a good job, and maybe they started a little later, but maybe they’re also more difficult states.\\n\\nBut we’ve done, I think, on average, really phenomenally as a country.\\xa0 I think we’ve done phenomenally.\\xa0 Because when you looked at that graph the other day — I don’t know if you saw it; I assume you saw it.\\xa0 Everybody in the world saw it.\\xa0 But you look at all those lines on the bottom — one color after another, all different, representing different states — it’s all crowded at the bottom.\\xa0 And then you had two that were up.\\xa0 But you had — I don’t know, almost every one of them was down low.\\xa0 Very low.\\xa0 So there were a lot of people listening.\\n\\nAnd I just did — I want to be clear because I don’t need headlines tomorrow, and neither does the country, because I don’t want this country working so hard and then have press that is, in this case, maybe misinterpret something.\\xa0 Because I might have — I might have — when I heard it, I was surprised at first too, but I understood what Deborah meant.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can you clear something else up again?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But I think it’s very important — because I think it’s very important for you to be accurate.\\n\\nOne other thing.\\xa0 Just a quick thing.\\xa0 So, what I found is when governors call me — I mean, I think in every case, they’ve always been so nice.\\xa0 So nice.\\xa0 And I’ve seen them and heard them say, “Thank you very much. You have done a great job.”\\n“A fantastic job,” in one case.\\xa0 “Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you.”\\xa0 Then I’ll see the governor, usually of the opposite party.\\xa0 In almost all cases, except maybe one — but in almost all cases, they’re very generous, they’re very nice.\\xa0 They thank me.\\xa0 Everything is great.\\xa0 We’re doing a great job.\\n\\nAnd then I’ll see them on television, and just like a different person.\\xa0 And I realized there are some people, because of politics, that if they say, “We want 1,000 ventilators,” and I’ll say, “No, Jim, I want to give you 5,000 ventilators,”\\xa0they’ll say, “Thank you.\\xa0 You are the greatest President that’s ever lived.”\\xa0 And then, I’ll see them quoted in a paper or see them on a show, and they’ll say, “The President didn’t come through for me.\\xa0 I’m very disappointed in the President.”\\n\\nAnd we have a lot of that.\\xa0 They’re very happy when they talk to me, and then I see them.\\xa0 But there are some people, if they asked for 500 of something, and if I gave them 5,000, they will say — you’ll say, “How’s the President doing?”\\xa0 “Well, we don’t like the job.”\\xa0 To my face, they’re very nice, but then sometimes — I guess, they assume I don’t watch them or something, but I watch very closely.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, one especially vulnerable population is the prison population, and that’s — especially with Jared here, I wondered if you could address what the federal government is doing to protect inmates.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it’s vulnerable in that it’s close together, really.\\xa0 I — I can’t tell you about age, but a lot of young people in prison.\\n\\nSome people — some states — I have not done that at all, but some states are letting people out of prison.\\xa0 Some people are getting out that are very serious criminals, in some states. And I don’t like that.\\xa0 I don’t like it.\\xa0 But it’s a city or state thing in certain cases, as you know.\\xa0 I think maybe Philadelphia comes to mind.\\xa0 So we’ll see.\\xa0 You have to see what what’s going on.\\xa0 And we don’t like it.\\xa0 The people don’t like it.\\xa0 And we’re looking in to see if I have the right to stop it in some cases, okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment last week.\\xa0 We haven’t heard you talk a lot today about what they’re going through.\\xa0 So what’s —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, I think it’s —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — your message to them?\\xa0 And —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think they’re going through —\\xa0I think it’s terrible.\\n\\nSo, look, four weeks ago, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world.\\xa0 The greatest in the world — greatest in the history of the world.\\xa0 We had the most jobs ever in the history of the United States.\\xa0 Almost 160 million jobs, right?\\n\\nAnd then, one day, I get a call from Deborah, who’s fantastic, and from Dr. Fauci.\\xa0 And he said and she said, “We have a problem.”\\xa0 I said, “What’s the problem?”\\xa0 And they said, “We may have to close it up.”\\xa0 I said, “Close what up?”\\xa0 They said, “Close up the country.”\\xa0 And I said, “What’s that all about?”\\xa0 And we discussed today — and probably not since 1917; we came to that conclusion — and she is a fantastic person, a brilliant person, and this is what she knows.\\xa0 I said, “Has it ever been this bad?”\\xa0 And I think I can represent that you said “no.”\\xa0 And part of it — it’s a contagion.\\xa0 It’s so contagious.\\n\\nIt’s like, if you sneeze, I probably get it.\\xa0 Whoever heard of a thing like that?\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 And this very talented reporter is bailing out.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 He’s out of here.\\xa0 I don’t blame you.\\n\\nBut it’s a very contagious thing, and — probably the likes of which we’ve never seen in terms of that.\\n\\nBut 1917 — so that’s over 100 years ago, but that was — you know, it’s been written about many, many times.\\xa0 That was a horrible — whether it was 75 or 100 million people — I’ve heard from 50 to 75, I’ve heard 75 to 100 — but it was tens of millions of people.\\n\\nNow, we have the advantage of communication.\\xa0 This could have been just as bad.\\xa0 I mean, here we can read on the Internet.\\xa0 We can see what to do.\\xa0 We can have these meetings; they can watch on television, which they do.\\xa0 A lot of people are watching.\\xa0 A lot of people are watching.\\xa0 And they say, “Gee, social distancing.”\\n\\nBut in 1917, they didn’t have that option.\\xa0 You know, they didn’t know what to do.\\xa0 They just noticed people were dying all over the place.\\xa0 Think of it: 75- to 100 million people died.\\xa0 A lot of people in this country died.\\n\\nI always — to me, it’s a great — it’s a great question: How come more people didn’t die in this country?\\xa0 And they say it actually started in this country and went to Europe.\\xa0 I mean, we lost a lot of people, but relatively, we lost very few compared to Europe.\\xa0 So this is a terrible thing that happened.\\n\\nAnd what’s happening now, with people and jobs — so think of the position I’m in.\\xa0 We have built all together, everybody — not me, everybody — the greatest economy in history.\\xa0 And all of a sudden, people come in that we respect and we know.\\xa0 And here’s the thing: They were right.\\xa0 Everybody questioned it for a while.\\xa0 Not everybody, but a good portion questioned it.\\xa0 They said, “Let’s keep it open.\\xa0 Let’s ride it.”\\xa0 If we did that — you saw the other graph.\\xa0 And whether it’s true or almost true or maybe not true enough — the number was 2.2 million people would have died.\\xa0 2.2 million people would have died in a short period of time.\\xa0 In fact, the graph could have been even shorter.\\xa0 I always noticed that that horrible one — where it goes high — it actually comes down a little bit faster.\\xa0 It might have been over faster and you would have lost 2.2 million people.\\n\\nSo they come in and they say, “We have to close up the country.”\\xa0 And I say, “You know what that does to this — to the fabric of this country, to people that had great jobs, great family, no problems with money?”\\xa0 Their 401(k) — everything is perfect, then all of a sudden, they go from that to having no job in one day.\\xa0 They never even thought of it.\\xa0 And then you see 6 million people unemployed.\\xa0 Unemployment numbers get released and you see 6 million people.\\n\\nAnd it’s an artificial closing.\\xa0 It’s not like we have a massive recession or worse.\\xa0 It’s artificial because we turned it off.\\xa0 Think of all we’re doing.\\xa0 We’re saying, “Don’t go to work and we’ll pay you.”\\xa0 Everything is the opposite.\\xa0 It was always, “Go to work and make a lot of money and do well, and — the American Dream.”\\xa0 Because of a hidden enemy, we’re saying, “Don’t go to work and we’re going to pay you.”\\n\\nLook at the money: $2 trillion.\\xa0 And we will probably do more.\\xa0 I think infrastructure would be a fantastic thing to do.\\n\\nYou want to get the restaurants back?\\xa0 You give deductibility.\\xa0 You understand what that is.\\xa0 You give deductibility for businesses where they go and they use the restaurants.\\xa0 The restaurants will be bigger and better than they were before.\\xa0 You know, people don’t know: A lot of restaurants closed when they ended deductibility.\\xa0 And then they started doing well, but they had fewer restaurants.\\xa0 But the boom of the restaurants is when they had deductibility, where corporations could use them.\\xa0 So — and entertainment.\\xa0 That was a great thing.\\n\\nBut they closed it, and then they closed it again.\\xa0 And it wasn’t the same.\\xa0 But if you want to get them back, you do that.\\n\\nBut infrastructure: We borrow our money now at zero.\\xa0 You know, if were paying 5 percent, 4 percent, 3 percent, it’s a different ballgame.\\xa0 We’re borrowing — we can borrow long term for zero — literally zero; you know that — because we’re considered the safe investment.\\xa0 All over the world, they want money in the United States.\\xa0 That’s where they want the money.\\n\\nSo I know better than anybody.\\xa0 I just — I know what they’re going through, and it’s horrible.\\xa0 But you know what I want to do?\\xa0 I want to be able to get them back fast.\\xa0 When this is over, it’s going to be a day we’re going to celebrate, because everyone is going to go to work and I think we’re going to have boom times.\\xa0 I think it’s going to be great.\\n\\nAnd we’ve learned a lot.\\xa0 We’ve learned about borders.\\xa0 We’ve learned about reliance on other countries.\\xa0 We’ve learned so much — so much that I think we really have a chance to be bigger and better and stronger.\\xa0 And I think it’s going to come back very quickly, but first we have to defeat this enemy.\\n\\nSo we will see you tomorrow.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nEND\\n\\n7:38 P.M.

       "  'text': 'James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\\n\\n5:35 P.M. EDT\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much everybody.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 So, America continues to wage all-out war to defeat the virus — this horrible, horrible virus.\\xa0 You see how terrible it is, especially when you look at the numbers from yesterday.\\xa0 And we explained why we’re extending our nationwide guidelines to slow the spread by 30 days.\\n\\nTogether, we have the power to save countless lives.\\xa0 We’re attacking the virus on every front with social distancing, economic support for our workers, rapid medical intervention, and very serious innovation, and banning dangerous foreign travel that threatens the health of our people.\\xa0 And we did that early — far earlier than anyone would have thought and way ahead of anybody else.\\n\\nIn this time of need, I know that every American will do their patriotic duty and help us to achieve a total victory.\\xa0 As governments and nations focus on the coronavirus, there’s a growing threat that cartels, criminals, terrorists, and other malign actors will try to exploit the situation for their own gain.\\xa0 And we must not let that happen.\\xa0 We will never let that happen.\\n\\nToday, the United States is launching enhanced counter-narcotics operations in the Western Hemisphere to protect the American people from the deadly scourge of illegal narcotics.\\xa0 We must not let the drug cartels exploit the pandemic to threaten American lives.\\n\\nIn cooperation with the 22 partner nations, U.S. Southern Command will increase surveillance, disruption, and seizures of drug shipments and provide additional support for eradication efforts which are going on right now at a record pace.\\xa0 We’re deploying additional Navy destroyers, combat ships, aircraft, and helicopters; Coast Guard cutters; and Air Force surveillance aircraft, doubling our capabilities in the region.\\xa0 Very importantly, our forces are fully equipped with personnel protective equipment, and we’ve taken additional safety measures to ensure our troops remain healthy.\\n\\nSecretary Mark Esper, Attorney General Bill Barr, National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien will provide more details.\\xa0 In addition, I’m going to have General Milley, who has done an incredible job in so many ways, say a few words.\\xa0 And also with us: our Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Gilday, who you know — I think you know; and Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Schultz.\\nSo I’m going to ask Mark to start and then we can go.\\xa0 And after that, we’re going to take questions as it pertains to this.\\xa0 And then we’ll go onto phase two, which is the virus itself.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nThank you, please.\\xa0 Mark.\\n\\nSECRETARY ESPER: \\xa0Well, thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 And good afternoon, everyone.\\xa0 I appreciate the opportunity to be here today as we make this very important announcement.\\xa0 At a time when the nation and the Department of Defense are focused on protecting the American people from the spread of the coronavirus, we also remain vigilant to the many other threats our country faces.\\n\\nToday, at the President’s direction, the Department of Defense, in close cooperation with our interagency partners, began enhanced counter-narcotics operations in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea.\\xa0 This initiative is part of the administration’s whole-of-government approach to combating the flow of illicit drugs into the United States and protecting the American people from their scourge.\\n\\nI want to thank all of our partners in this effort, to include the United States Coast Guard, the Department of Homeland Security, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of Justice, and members of the intelligence community for their tremendous support and cooperation.\\n\\nTo conduct these enhanced operations, the President has directed the deployment of additional ships, aircraft, and security forces to the United States Southern Command Area of Responsibility.\\xa0 Included in this force package are Navy destroyers and littoral combat ships, Coast Guard cutters, P-8 patrol aircraft, and elements of an Army Security Force Assistance Brigade.\\xa0 These additional forces will nearly double our capacity to conduct counter-narcotics operations in the region.\\n\\nAdditionally, 22 partner nations have joined us in this fight, bringing with them a variety of intelligence and operations capabilities needed to defeat these criminal organizations.\\n\\nLast year alone, United States Southern Command’s operations resulted in the seizure of over 280 metric tons of drugs, much of which was designated for shipment to America.\\n\\nWhile this was an incredible achievement, there’s much more work to be done.\\xa0 Transnational criminal organizations continue to threaten our security by smuggling cocaine, fentanyl, methamphetamines, and other narcotics across our borders.\\xa0 These drug traffickers put our communities — communities at risk and destroy lives.\\xa0 Every year, tens of thousands of Americans die from drug overdose and thousands more suffer the harmful effects of addiction.\\n\\nFurthermore, corrupt actors, like the illegitimate Maduro regime in Venezuela, rely on the profits derived from the sale of narcotics to maintain their oppressive hold on power.\\xa0 The Venezuelan people continue to suffer tremendously due to Maduro’s criminal control over the country.\\n\\nDrug traffickers are seizing on this lawlessness by increasing their illicit activities.\\xa0 We must do more to prevent these drugs from arriving at our shores.\\xa0 These enhanced counter-narcotics operations that are now underway will further disrupt the flow of illicit drugs to America, deny our adversaries the financial resources they depend on, and build the capacity of our partner nations throughout the region.\\n\\nI want to thank President Trump for his leadership and support to this critical mission.\\xa0 This is a particularly important time for this operation to begin, as nations around the world shift their focus inward to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, many criminal organizations are attempting to capitalize on this crisis.\\xa0 The enhanced operations we’re announcing today will keep the pressure on these criminal groups and protect the American people from the devastation caused by the flow of illegal drugs into our country.\\n\\nMr.\\xa0 President, thank you for your leadership as we begin this important operation.\\xa0 While the men and women of the United States military work hard here at home to fight the coronavirus, we continue to take action around the world to defend our great country.\\n\\nThank you and I’d like to invite General Milley.\\n\\nGENERAL MILLEY:\\xa0 Thank you, Secretary, for those words.\\xa0 And thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership.\\xa0 And I want to publicly thank Admiral Craig Faller, the Commander of the U.S. Southern Command out of Miami, for leading this operation, which is underway effective today; and also Admiral Gilday, the Chief of Naval Operations, and Admiral Schultz for their contributions to this from their services.\\xa0 There’s thousands of sailors, Coast Guardsmen, soldiers, airmen, Marines involved in this operation.\\n\\nWe came upon some intelligence some time ago that the drug cartels, as a result of COVID-19, were going to try to take advantage of the situation and try to infiltrate additional drugs into our country.\\xa0 As we know, 70,000 Americans die on an average annual basis to drugs.\\xa0 That’s unacceptable.\\xa0 We’re at war with COVID-19, we’re at war with terrorists, and we are at war with the drug cartels as well.\\n\\nThis is the United States military.\\xa0 You will not penetrate this country.\\xa0 You will not get past Jump Street.\\xa0 You’re not going to come in here and kill additional Americans.\\xa0 And we will marshal whatever assets are required to prevent your entry into this country to kill Americans.\\n\\nSo, right now, the Navy has marshalled additional grey-hull ships from both PACOM and EUCOM and for the naval fleet at Norfolk.\\xa0 And they are set sail already and they are in the Caribbean right now.\\xa0 In addition to that, there’s 10 Coast Guard cutters and there’s Special Operations Forces and Security Force Assistance Brigades, along with Air Force reconnaissance aircraft.\\nThe bottom line is: You’re not going to get through.\\xa0 Now is not the time to try to penetrate the United States with illegal drugs to kill Americans.\\xa0 We’re the United States military and we will defend our country, regardless of the cost.\\n\\nThank you, Mr.\\xa0 President.\\xa0 Thank you, Secretary.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much, General.\\xa0 Beautiful.\\xa0 Thank you.\\nBill.\\n\\nATTORNEY GENERAL BARR:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr.\\xa0 President, and thanks for your decisive leadership as we confront this unprecedented challenge posed by corona- — coronavirus.\\xa0 I’d like to thank you for your support for this important initiative and thank all of — the Secretary of Defense and all the services for taking on this — this important initiative.\\n\\nObviously, during this crisis, we’re all focused above all else on COVID-19.\\xa0 But at the same time, our law enforcement and national security work must go forward, protecting the American people from the full array of threats.\\n\\nFor the Department of Justice, one of our highest priorities must remain destroying the Mexican cartels.\\xa0 Their trafficking is largely responsible for the deaths, as we all know now, of 70,000 Americans a year.\\xa0 And also the costs of this don’t count the destroyed families, the destroyed lives, the draining of our national treasure as state budgets are crushed by the burden that this — this narcotic trafficking causes.\\n\\nThe President has made clear that we are in this fight against the cartels to win, and that we are not interested in half measures, and that the threat posed by the cartel is not just a law enforcement threat, but a national security threat as well.\\nAnd, in December, building on your success with the Mexican President in forging a cooperative relationship in the area of immigration, you asked me to go down and meet with the President López Obrador and our Mexican counterparts to see if we could also establish a more comprehensive and coordinated effort with the Mexicans in confronting the cartels.\\xa0 And we’ve had some successful visits and discussions, and currently have an array of activities underway against the cartels.\\xa0 And we anticipate, along with the Mexicans, that these are going to bear fruit in the months ahead.\\n\\nBut it quickly became clear that we can obtain the most immediate results, the best bang for the buck, where we increase the assets involved in interdiction on both the Pacific and Atlantic side of Mexico in the Central American countries.\\xa0 For years, the cartels have been using these sea routes to take the cocaine up from, principally, Colombia — now also out of Venezuela.\\xa0 And these sea routes on both coasts have become the primary means of bringing cocaine up to the United States.\\n\\nBecause of the superb work done by the Defense Department and our intelligence community, we know exactly, most of the time, where these traffickers are at sea.\\xa0 But we’re significantly — have been up until now significantly limited in our ability to interdict because of the numbers of the assets we have deployed.\\nPrior today, this limitation meant we could only intercept a fraction of the traffickers that — and the various boats that were detected.\\xa0 This will now double our capacity, and we are talking about hundreds of tons of cocaine now — we’re now in a position to seize.\\n\\nSo this is going to radically improve our interdiction efforts and put tremendous pressure, we think, on the cartels.\\xa0 And the effort that SOUTHCOM is undertaking is going to save lives by taking drugs off the street.\\nLast week, I announced the unsealing of charges of narco-terrorism, drug trafficking, and other crimes against the former Maduro regime — 16 members of that regime — and their involvement in trafficking of 250 metric tons a year.\\xa0 A lot of that comes by sea, as I discussed at that time.\\n\\nBut also, because of the pressure we’re applying by our sea interdiction, they are trying to establish an air route out of Venezuela, up into Central America, which is one of the reasons we’re trying to move firmly against that corrupt regime.\\n\\nYou know, this drug war has gone on for many decades.\\xa0 And at times in the past, we’ve had great success and great results.\\xa0 And at times, we’ve taken our eye off the ball — fortunately, not in this administration.\\xa0 And I’m grateful that you, Mr. President, have brought focus to this fight and the determination to use whatever tools are necessary to win the fight.\\xa0 The cartels have to be defeated, both for the people of this country and for the people of Mexico and Venezuela.\\n\\nSo I’d like to thank you again, Mr. President, Secretary Esper, for providing the wherewithal required to help win this war against the cartels and others who seek to send illicit drugs into our country.\\n\\nAnd, with that, I’d like to introduce Ambassador O’Brien.\\n\\nAMBASSADOR O’BRIEN:\\xa0 Thank you, General.\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Today’s action is another example of the bold leadership of President Trump and his commitment to protecting the homeland against threats that seek to destabilize the United States and our Western Hemisphere.\\n\\nThe uncontrolled flow of illegal drugs into the United States poisons our communities; fuels the dangerous epidemic — epidemic of addiction; and threatens the safety and security of all Americans.\\n\\nThe impressive U.S. Navy, Coast Guard, Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and interagency operation will address a range of threats to our national security posed by narco-traffickers and narco-terrorists.\\n\\nIt will reduce illicit financial support for the drug traffic- — for drug trafficking that provides the corrupt Maduro regime in Venezuela and other bad actors with the funds necessary to conduct their malign activities.\\n\\nUnder President Trump’s leadership, we will continue to execute our maximum pressure policy to counter the Maduro regime’s malign activities, including drug trafficking.\\xa0 And this operation will help to choke off the funds that go to that corrupt regime.\\n\\nMaduro, narco-terrorists, and criminals should make no mistake that even as we are working around the clock to fight the spread of coronavirus, we will continue to execute the President’s counter-narcotics strategy.\\n\\nWe’re working on a number of important national security priorities as we face this public health crisis.\\xa0 The United States will continue to combat disinformation and fake news about this virus.\\xa0 We will work with the world’s largest oil producers to address volatility in global oil markets.\\xa0 We will always protect our servicemen and servicewomen around the world, including in Iraq and Afghanistan.\\n\\nI want the American people to know that President Trump and Vice President Pence and their administration are working tirelessly every day to protect the health and well-being of Americans and respond to the coronavirus.\\n\\nOur adversaries should take note however: This President has a clear-eyed focus on America’s national security’s — security interest.\\xa0 And let me be clear, it would be a mistake — a mistake with terrible consequences — for any adversary to attempt to do us harm during this health crisis — or ever, for that matter.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 So do we have any questions on this?\\xa0 Because this group is going to go back to work.\\xa0 They’re going to leave.\\n\\nJohn, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A question either for you, Mr. President, or Secretary Esper.\\xa0 What has changed that is allowing these assets to be deployed now, whereas, as General Barr said, in the past, they were not available?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, for a long time, we’ve had a lot of drugs coming into our country.\\xa0 And it’s not that it’s increased, it’s prob- — we’ve probably got it down a little bit, but it’s still a tremendous number.\\xa0 Families are being ruined.\\xa0 Lives are being ruined.\\xa0 It’s an incredible thing, especially as you’re at this position.\\xa0 You would never believe it.\\xa0 I see things that nobody would believe.\\xa0 I see reports that nobody would believe.\\n\\nSo I met with the group behind me, all of them, and we said, “What do you think we can do?”\\xa0 And they think they can interdict.\\xa0 They think we can stop it before it gets to the shores.\\xa0 And they’re coming from all over the place.\\xa0 And we have incredibly talented people.\\n\\nSo I think I’m going to let Mark just give a little bit of an answer to that.\\xa0 But we just want to see if we can stop a big — a good percentage of the drugs coming into our country.\\n\\nSECRETARY ESPER:\\xa0 Sure thing.\\xa0 Thanks, Mr. President.\\n\\nSo, first of all, it’s simply a matter of prioritization.\\xa0 The President has giving us very clear guidance on what’s important to him and protecting the American people.\\xa0 And, as some of you know, I’ve began — I began a review months ago, looking at all of our different geographic combatant commands and looking at where we can free up time, money, and resources to put in — into other endeavors.\\n\\nIn this case, we had scrutinized our inventory fairly closely.\\xa0 Chairman Milley did a great deal of work on this Admiral Gilday.\\xa0 And we felt that there was no risk to the fleet, to our operations to free up, in this case, naval ships.\\xa0 We also freed up aircraft and other assets to apply them to this presidential priority.\\xa0 And of course the Coast Guard did the same.\\n\\nSo it was a very good operation.\\xa0 We feel this is very important to the American people and completely in line with the President’s direction.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And how long will you be able to keep up this operational tempo?\\n\\nSECRETARY ESPER:\\xa0 Well, it depends.\\xa0 What we’re going to do is we’re going to run it for some matter of time.\\xa0 I’m not going to disclose how long that will be.\\xa0 And then we will assess it, and then we will make adjustments from there.\\xa0 We may increase.\\xa0 We may decrease. \\xa0We may sustain as is.\\xa0 But this will be an assessment we will do as interagency team.\\xa0 We will report back to the President.\\xa0 And we’ll take further guidance from there.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And, you know, we didn’t do it for this reason, but it’ll also have an impact on the virus because we have people trying to get in.\\xa0 So not only drugs, but now we have a new phenomena.\\xa0 And that’s at least for the next hopefully short period of time — the virus.\\xa0 So we’ll be able to have an effect on that too.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Mr. President, could you expand on that a little bit?\\xa0 Because you tie it to COVID-19, saying that these drug cartels were taking advantage of the situation, of this pandemic.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s right.\\xa0 They were.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How exactly —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, because we’re focused on so many other parts of the country, and even parts of the world.\\xa0 And, all of a sudden, areas where we — we had it clamped down pretty tight — in all fairness.\\n\\nYou know, the wall is up to about 160 miles already.\\xa0 And any areas where we have that wall, it’s, for the most part, contiguous.\\xa0 We have fill-ins.\\xa0 But we’re up to 161 miles exactly.\\n\\nAnd any place where you have that wall, other than walking around it on the edges, it’s stopping everybody cold.\\xa0 I mean, we’re stopping — we’re — nobody has seen anything like it.\\xa0 That’s how good it works.\\xa0 And the other side knew it worked that well — everybody.\\xa0 Because everybody was for it five years ago.\\xa0 All of a sudden, they changed.\\xa0 It’s having a tremendous impact.\\n\\nBut we are now focused on so many different things because of what’s happened, because of this horrible — I say it’s a horrible phenomena that now we’ve got to focus on drugs.\\xa0 And the drugs come in from different methods.\\xa0 And we have the best people at sea anywhere in the world, so we’ll have a tremendous impact on drugs.\\n\\nBut one of the other things: We’ll also have an impact, we think on the — on the virus.\\n\\nOkay?\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Ambassador O’Brien, did China underreport both the number of cases and the death toll from the coronavirus?\\xa0 And if that’s the case, Mr. President, what does that mean for our relationship with China and your relationship with President Xi?\\n\\nAMBASSADOR O’BRIEN:\\xa0 Well, number one, I think the President has a great relationship with President Xi.\\xa0 And we’d like to have a great relationship with China.\\xa0 Unfortunately, we are just not in a position to confirm any of the numbers that are coming out of China.\\xa0 There’s no way to confirm any of those numbers.\\n\\nThere’s lots of public reporting on whether the numbers are — are too low.\\xa0 You’ve got access to those reports that are coming out of the Chinese social media and — and some of the few reporters that are left in China.\\xa0 We just have no way to confirm any of those numbers.\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We really don’t know.\\xa0 I mean, yeah — look, how do we know whether if they underreported or reported however they report?\\n\\nBut we had a great call the other night.\\xa0 We’re working together on a lot of different things, including trade.\\xa0 They’re buying a lot.\\xa0 They’re spending a lot of money and they’re giving it to our farmers.\\xa0 They’re paying our farmers for the product.\\xa0 So, you know, we’re going to — we’re going to continue that along.\\n\\nJohn.\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I have another one, sir.\\xa0 You tweeted earlier today that there was — you have uncovered intelligence that there is a sneak attack being planned against American troops, American assets in Iraq.\\xa0 Are we talking about Kata’ib Hezbollah again?\\xa0 Also —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I know what you’re saying, but we just have information that they were planning something.\\xa0 And it’s very good information.\\xa0 It was led by Iran — not necessarily Iran, but by groups supported by Iran.\\xa0 But that, to me, is Iran.\\xa0 And we’re just saying, “Don’t do it.\\xa0 Don’t do it.”\\xa0 It would be a very bad thing for them if they did it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The last time they did do it in early March, at Camp Taji, there was a response from the military against Kata’ib Hezbollah and Kata’ib Hezbollah alone.\\xa0 Your tweets —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That was a very powerful response, by the way.\\xa0 That response knocked out five different places, but it also took out a lot of very bad people.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Your tweets seemed to suggest though that if it happens again, it may go up the food chain.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, that was a very big response.\\xa0 You know, we knocked out a lot.\\xa0 We looked — they hit one site; we hit five big ones and ammunition sites.\\xa0 You saw the — you saw what happened.\\xa0 And I won’t say how many people were killed, but some bad people were killed.\\xa0 And a lot of them.\\xa0 That was a big response.\\xa0 But this response will be bigger if they do something.\\n\\nYeah.\\xa0 You had one.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Just going back to your conversation with President Xi, I’m wondering if you received an intelligence report that talked about the discrepancy in the numbers and if you addressed that with President Xi?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We have not received that.\\xa0 But their numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side.\\xa0 And I’m being nice when I say that, relative to what we witnessed and what was reported.\\n\\nBut we discussed that with him — not so much the numbers, as what they did and how they’re doing.\\xa0 And we’re in constant communication with — I mean, I would say the biggest communication is myself and President Xi.\\xa0 The relationship is very good.\\n\\nWe have — look, they’re spending — they will be spending, when things even out — this is obviously a little bit of a hurdle, what’s happened over the last month.\\xa0 But they’ll be spending $250 billion, buying our product: $50 billion to the farmers alone, $200 billion to other things.\\xa0 They never did that before.\\xa0 So we have a great trade deal.\\xa0 And we’d like to keep it, they’d like to keep it, and the relationship is good.\\n\\nAs to whether or not their numbers are accurate, I’m not an accountant from China.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Does this strain things at all, in terms of the trade deal?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, because people just don’t know.\\xa0 People don’t know where did it come from.\\xa0 I think we all understand where it came from.\\xa0 And President Xi understands that.\\xa0 And we don’t have to make a big deal out of it.\\n\\nWe didn’t like the fact that they said it came from our soldiers.\\xa0 And they haven’t pursued that.\\xa0 It was — and that was a mid-level person said that.\\xa0 That was not a high-level person, so I assume.\\xa0 I will always assume the best.\\xa0 I’ll assume the high-level people didn’t know about it.\\xa0 It was a foolish statement.\\n\\nSo, look, the relationship with China is a good one, and my relationship with him is, you know, really good.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I follow up just on that point on Chinese propaganda that you mentioned, as well as Ambassador O’Brien?\\xa0 So in the past several weeks, China has been shipping PPEs — you know, masks.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 They’ve either been selling or donating everywhere — Africa, Europe, Italy, Russia — and really pushing this narrative that they’re taking on a global leadership role in the crisis.\\xa0 So what are your thoughts on that?\\xa0 And is there any plan for the administration to take on that role?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I don’t mind if they want it.\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 I view that as a positive, if they’re helping other countries.\\xa0 We have 151 countries right now that are under siege by the virus.\\xa0 Under siege.\\xa0 Some are doing really badly.\\xa0 You know, they don’t know about social distancing.\\xa0 These are countries that aren’t highly sophisticated.\\xa0 They don’t have great communication with the rest of the world.\\xa0 I mean, they don’t know the things that we’re doing and that some others are able to do.\\n\\nAnd if China can help them, I’m all for it.\\xa0 I’m for all of us helping everybody.\\xa0 We’re soon going to have more ventilators than we need.\\xa0 We’re building thousands of ventilators right now.\\xa0 Now, it takes a period of time to build them.\\xa0 And again, nobody could have known a thing like this could happen.\\xa0 We’re building thousands.\\xa0 We will fairly soon be at a point where we have far more than we can use, even after we stockpile for some future catastrophe, which we hope doesn’t happen.\\n\\nWe’re going to be distributing them — the extras — around the world.\\xa0 We’ll go to Italy, we’ll go to France.\\xa0 It will go to Spain, which is, you know, very hard hit.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just to follow up on that note: Is there any truth on reporting that your administration is stopping shipment of USAID stockpiles of PPEs abroad?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 No, truth whatsoever.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So your administration is not —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, we want — I would love China and other countries, if they have additional supplies, medical supplies, to give to other countries.\\xa0 A hundred and fifty-one — 151 —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So at this time, the U.S. is still shipping to USAID?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Why would I stop that?\\xa0 Wouldn’t that be terrible to stop it?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No, I mean, is the U.S. stopping shipment of our own stockpile, through USAID, to other countries?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 Whatever we have, whatever we’ve committed to, we commit.\\xa0 But we also need a lot for ourselves, so we’re very focused on that until we get over this.\\xa0 So obviously, we’re not going to be shipping too much until — now, we do have excess of certain things, and we don’t have enough of others.\\n\\nI just had a great talk today with the — Doug McMillon, from Walmart.\\xa0 And I gave him a very, very big order to — for gowns, for protective gear for the doctors, for the nurses, for everything.\\xa0 And he’s actually very excited about it.\\xa0 He’s the biggest purchaser of this kind of thing.\\xa0 I mean, of anything probably in the world.\\xa0 And he is very excited about it.\\n\\nAnd he said, “What size?”\\xa0 I said, “It’s almost unlimited.” When you look at these hospitals, the amount that they order, you almost say, “How could they possibly use so much, whether it’s masks or the protective gear?”\\xa0 But we are supplying a tremendous amount, and we just ordered a lot from Walmart.\\xa0 And he’s taken this on personally.\\xa0 And I said, “Let it go ship — let it be shipped not to a warehouse, directly to the side of the hospital or wherever they need it,” because we save a lot of time when we do that.\\n\\nSo Walmart, in addition to many other companies and people, is now involved at the highest level.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The announcements that were made today are aimed at curbing the flow of narcotics into the country.\\xa0 Are you concerned that we’re possibly losing ground on the drug crisis while we’re combatting —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I don’t think we’re losing ground, but we don’t want to lose ground.\\xa0 That’s why we’re doing it.\\xa0 I don’t want to lose ground.\\xa0 That’s a big fight.\\n\\nI’ve seen many families where they’re wiped out because they lost a son or a daughter, or a husband or a wife, or whatever — or all of them.\\xa0 And we don’t want to lose ground.\\xa0 And we are heavily focused on the virus.\\xa0 Very heavily focused.\\xa0 And with this, we have never — after this goes into effect, which essentially is now, we will never have been so focused on drugs coming into our country as we are right now.\\n\\nAnd remember, as that wall gets bigger, that really helps us a lot.\\xa0 It really helps us a lot.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is the Mexican government or any other Latin American government working in conjunction with this operation to help with that drug —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Many of the governments are, and Mexico, in particular, is.\\xa0 And Mexico, right now, has — we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our southern border, keeping people out of our country.\\xa0 And we’re — very few people are coming into our country right now.\\n\\nAnd as we complete, again, the wall, in addition to the 27,000 soldiers, it’s — it’s a very — it’s a very tough place to come into.\\xa0 When I — when I took over, people were coming in and they were bringing whatever they wanted.\\xa0 They were bringing drugs of any type, and now it’s very hard for them.\\xa0 And it will get harder and harder.\\n\\nBut the President of Mexico is a great guy who’s really helped us a lot: 27,000 soldiers — 27,000 Mexican soldiers.\\n\\nAnd you remember when I first took over, they had all of the caravans coming up with 10,000, 15,000 people in the caravans.\\xa0 They were marching through Mexico.\\xa0 That’s not happening anymore.\\n\\nPlease, in the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, are narco militants such as the FARC 57th Front out of Colombia or the Maduro regime — do you know if they’re working in conjunction with the Mexican cartels?\\xa0 Is there any intelligence indicating that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I cannot tell you that.\\xa0 I can — I know the answer to that.\\xa0 I believe I do.\\xa0 But I cannot tell you that.\\xa0 We have information that would lead us to believe something very powerfully, but I cannot tell you the answer to that.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\xa0 Jeff.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, have U.S. forces in Iraq taken any precautions because of this particular attack?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, sure.\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And have you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They’re taking precautions, and we are watching it very closely.\\xa0 And if something bad happens, it’s going to be very painful for the other side.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have you been in touch with the Iraqi government about this?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They know about it, yeah.\\xa0 They know about it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are they offering additional protection or anything?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’ll see.\\xa0 We’ll see what happens.\\xa0 But, you know, we’re down to a small force now.\\xa0 Over the years since I got — we’ve been bringing smaller and smaller.\\xa0 And we’re down right now to a small number, but we have very powerful airpower there.\\xa0 We have the big base, and — which will — you know, I mean, nobody can get near it.\\xa0 Nobody can even get near that.\\xa0 But we’ve really, largely, left.\\xa0 You know, we’ve taken tremendous amounts out and we’ve deployed them elsewhere, including bringing some back home.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And do you think tweeting about it will help prevent that from happening —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I think it’s — it’s not tweeting.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — or perhaps give them a heads up?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s called “social media.”\\xa0 It’s social media.\\xa0 It gets out.\\xa0 I have, you know, hundreds of millions of people.\\xa0 Number one on Facebook.\\xa0 Did you know I was number one on Facebook?\\xa0 I mean, I just found out I’m number one on Facebook.\\xa0 I thought that was very nice for whatever it means.\\n\\nNo, it represents something.\\xa0 And when I can explain to people: Just don’t do it.\\xa0 You know, it’s going to be bad if you do it.\\xa0 It’s going to be really bad.\\xa0 And they don’t need to do it.\\xa0 They have enough problems.\\xa0 Iran has enough problems without doing that.\\n\\nBut we’ve been pulling back very substantially over the last year, in Iraq.\\xa0 And so, you know, that’s the way it is.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You said, before, you don’t want to give the enemy — whoever that is in this case — a heads up.\\xa0 Do you feel like maybe you did?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\xa0 I’m just giving them a warning.\\xa0 It’s not a heads up.\\xa0 I’m giving them a warning.\\xa0 There’s a big difference.\\xa0 I’m saying: If you do anything to hurt our troops they’re going to — they’re going to pay a price.\\n\\nNo, they did last time, you know, as per the question.\\xa0 They did last time.\\xa0 We didn’t make a big deal out of it, but we hit very, very hard five massive, major ammunition sites, and a lot of people went with it.\\xa0 A lot of bad people.\\xa0 A lot of enemy went with it.\\xa0 And we didn’t want to make a big deal out of it, but they paid a big price.\\xa0 They’ll pay a much bigger price this time if they do anything.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, now that we have Admiral Gilday here, perhaps we could ask a question about what the plans are for the Roosevelt, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nADMIRAL GILDAY:\\xa0 In terms of the Roosevelt, we’re making great progress in terms of testing and also moving — moving people off the ship.\\xa0 So, in the past day or so, we’ve moved over 1,000.\\xa0 That number will increase to more than 2,700 by Friday as we continue to increase the testing as well and fly those samples off.\\xa0 So we’re getting after it pretty — pretty quickly.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And will the ship remain fully operational?\\n\\nADMIRAL GILDAY:\\xa0 It is fully operational now.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And it will remain so?\\n\\nADMIRAL GILDAY:\\xa0 It will remain so.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I ask a follow-up to that?\\xa0 What protocols are you putting in place to help mitigate the spread of coronavirus among servicemen and women who live and work in close quarters?\\n\\nADMIRAL GILDAY:\\xa0 Across the fleet, before we have any ships getting underway for training exercises, for deployments, they’re spending — those sailors are spending 14 days in quarantine before they get underway.\\xa0 We’ve increased the amount of testing equipment, as well as physicians onboard our ship at sea.\\xa0 So we’ve taken additional steps since the beginning of the COVID crisis.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And not too many people are going to be getting off at various ports anymore.\\xa0 Right?\\n\\nI think we —\\n\\nADMIRAL GILDAY:\\xa0 Correct.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We probably have decided on that.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You mean civilians?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 No — military people, from the ships.\\n\\nSECRETARY ESPER:\\xa0 I want to add one —\\xa0I’d like to add one thing to that.\\xa0 There seems to be this narrative out there that we should just shut down the entire United States military and address the problem that way.\\xa0 That’s not feasible.\\xa0 We have a mission.\\xa0 Our mission is to protect the United States of America and our people.\\xa0 And so we live and work in cramped quarters, whether it’s an aircraft carrier, a submarine, a tank, a bomber.\\xa0 It’s the nature of our business.\\n\\nBut the chain of command has very clear guidance.\\xa0 And I’m confident between the commanding officers and the senior non-commissioned officers, that they’re taking every reasonable precaution to make sure we practice, as best we can, social distancing, sanitizing environments, et cetera, consistent with that mission.\\xa0 And that’s what I trust Admiral Gilday, Acting Secretary Modly, and all the other service chiefs and service leaders to do.\\xa0 And I’m confident we’ll do that.\\xa0 Because keep in mind, we have a job to do and we will continue to do it: defend the United States of America.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you mentioned the stockpile earlier. The Washington Post reported today that the U.S. stockpile is nearly depleted of PPE.\\xa0 Is that the case?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And if so —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It is —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — how are you planning to mitigate that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — because we’re sending it directly to hospitals.\\xa0 We don’t want it to come to the stockpile because then we have to take it after it arrives and bring it to various states and hospitals.\\n\\nOne of the things — and again, we asked the state to do this as much as possible — many of the states have people that — whether it’s that or clothing; they make clothing — lots of clothing in many of the different states.\\xa0 We said, “See if you can get it directly from those manufacturers.\\xa0 Make a deal.”\\xa0 We’ll use the Purchase Act, if we have to, on them.\\xa0 If they won’t — by the way, so many people are — the spirit is incredible, what they’re doing.\\n\\nBut we’ve asked states where they have large manufacturers of different types of equipment to use those local factories, those local plants, and have it made directly. \\xa0Ship it right into the hospitals.\\n\\nWe’re shipping things right in.\\xa0 We have, as you know, almost 10,000 ventilators, which we need for flexibility.\\xa0 It’s a lot.\\xa0 It sounds like a lot, but it’s not.\\xa0 Because, as you see on the board from yesterday, as this scourge, as this plague, as this virus moves — it moves very fast — and we don’t know yet whether we’re going to need it in Louisiana, in New York, you know, wherever it may be.\\xa0 So we’re ready for it.\\xa0 We’re totally ready for it.\\n\\nWe’re going to be shipping out — we’ve already agreed to ship out over 1,000 today to different sites, different locations.\\xa0 But we have to have the flexibility of moving the ventilators to where — to where the virus is going.\\xa0 And we’ll be able to see that — you know, we’ll be able to see that from charts a couple of days in advance.\\n\\nSo right now we have a nice pile of ventilators.\\xa0 We have a lot more coming in.\\xa0 We have a lot of — I think we have 11 companies that are making ventilators right now.\\xa0 Very good companies.\\xa0 And they’re making them — you know about Ford, you know about General Motors, but we have a lot of companies making the ventilators right now.\\n\\nSo now, the question is — you know, when you make one, it doesn’t get made in 15 minutes.\\xa0 It’s not — a mask can go quickly; a ventilator takes time to build.\\xa0 It’s very, very — as we discussed, it’s complex, it’s big, it’s expensive — you know, et cetera.\\xa0 But we’ll be able to move.\\xa0 We have great flexibility.\\n\\nJohn?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I was just going to say, sir, do you want to move on to solely coronavirus or stick with the military —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I think if — does anybody have any other questions for this great group of brilliant people?\\n\\nYes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 A question for Secretary Esper.\\xa0 Is — the military personnel has been fanned out across the country to help combat the virus.\\xa0 Is there any chance that they’re planning to see, at some point, having military personnel treat or see COVID-19 patients?\\n\\nSECRETARY ESPER:\\xa0 Well, excuse me.\\xa0 As you know, we have the hospital ships currently deployed — one in LA and one in New York City.\\xa0 So they are — they will be — they could be treating patients as they come in.\\xa0 We’re taking precautionary measures to screen them beforehand to make sure that they’re not — they’re not exposed, if you will.\\n\\nSame with the military hospitals that we are — we’re deploying, certainly, again, to New York, Seattle, and other places.\\xa0 But the one thing we got to be careful of where we’re — where we’re — is that these are deployable assets; they are unique.\\xa0 So if we want to retain the ability to deploy military doctors, expeditionary military hospitals around the country, we got to preserve and protect them as — as best we can.\\n\\nThat said, we remain completely available to assist as need be, as directed by FEMA, as the Vice President and the President asks us.\\xa0 That’s what we commit to do to the American people to help safeguard them and protect them through this through this virus.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So as part of that, they — will they be seeing coronavirus patients or will they strictly be seeing other patients and helping (inaudible)?\\n\\nSECRETARY ESPER:\\xa0 They could have called upon — I think the best use for them is — based on their training and how they’re structured and organized — is for trauma.\\xa0 We can take the load off of hospitals with regard to their trauma patients, thereby freeing up rooms and other doctors, particularly doctors who are, you know, respiratory nurses or doctors who deal with infectious disease to treat those type of patients.\\n\\nSo I think it’s the best use of our resources.\\xa0 But again, if push comes to shove, we’re prepared to do what we have to assist the American people, at the same time preserving the medical capability we need to support our operations and deployed forces abroad.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And we’re looking at doing two additional brand-new hospital ships because these ships have really — I mean, they really struck a blow — a very positive blow for what they’re doing going into Los Angeles, going into New York.\\n\\nSo we’re looking very seriously at building two additional ships of about the same size.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Building two new ones or deploying two new ones?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’ll either be — well, building.\\xa0 But we’re looking at building either two new ones or doing the renovation of another large ship.\\xa0 But this has really worked out well.\\xa0 So, probably two brand-new ones.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just to follow up —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, Mr. President — Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Is this concerning the gentlemen, or do you want them —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 No.\\xa0 No.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You don’t want them to get back to work and capture all those bad people?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A follow-up, Mr. President or Mr. Secretary.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I know that Secretary Wilkie has said he’s on standby, waiting to hear if VA hospitals need to be opened — the doors need to be opened to civilians.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 True.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you talking about that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes, we are.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Could we see that happen?\\xa0 How soon would that happen?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 In fact, certain hospitals — yeah, certain hosp- — it can move very quickly.\\xa0 He’s a very capable man.\\xa0 We’re ready to move very quickly.\\xa0 As an example, in Louisiana, they have a very big hospital, so we’re looking to move very quickly if we need them.\\xa0 You know, hopefully we won’t need them.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 When will you make that decision?\\xa0 Do you think we’ll need that soon?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re going to find out pretty soon.\\xa0 We’re only going to know when — at the time it happens.\\xa0 We prepare for the worst.\\xa0 We are preparing for the worst.\\xa0 Unfortunately, that’s the way we have to look at it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just to follow up on the purpose of these naval ships, you mentioned something about, you know, treating trauma patients.\\xa0 And I’m just curious: What about things like, you know, giving birth?\\xa0 Would mothers be expected, in New York, for example —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, as I understand, they’re not doing that on the ship.\\xa0 That’s the one thing they’re not doing, outside of the COVID-19.\\xa0 They’re not doing that.\\xa0 The birth of a baby — not being done on the ships.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I have a follow-up question with Attorney General Barr, please?\\xa0 This has to do with the visa restrictions on immigrant doctors.\\xa0 Is the administration considering easing the restrictions or waiving restrictions for doctors with J-1 or H-1B visas so they can help other doctors during this crisis?\\n\\nATTORNEY GENERAL BARR:\\xa0 Actually, the immigration laws are no longer under the administration of the Department of Justice and I haven’t been participating in any of those discussions.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, what about you, Mr. President?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good.\\xa0 Any other questions?\\xa0 Please, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can you respond to that question, Mr. President?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 One more.\\xa0 One more for this group I have right here please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To Secretary Esper: The WHO — this is on the topic of coronavirus in Iran.\\xa0 The WHO confirms that Iran is vastly underreporting its coronavirus cases — not just cases, but fatalities.\\xa0 According to on-the-ground estimates, that might be as high as fifteen and a half thousand deaths.\\xa0 Thirty-two commanders in the military in Iran are now confirmed either in dire condition or dead.\\xa0 You have 8 percent of the parliament now down with coronavirus.\\xa0 So is Iran’s soundings of aggressions today that President Trump just tweeted about — do you think, strategically, is that a bluff on their part, or is this a sign of very clear desperation?\\xa0 Where are you, strategically, on that?\\n\\nSECRETARY ESPER:\\xa0 Well, first and foremost, we empathize for the Iranian people.\\xa0 I mean, they clearly have been hit hard.\\xa0 As you know, I — I think the President has spoken about it, certainly Secretary Pompeo.\\xa0 We’ve offered assistance, we’ve offered medical supplies, et cetera.\\xa0 They’ve refused that.\\xa0 I — I think if the Iranian regime put more interest, in terms of taking care of their people in the context of this virus, they would be better served.\\n\\nInstead, the Iranian regime continues to want to spread its malign activities throughout the region.\\xa0 They want to continue to send out the Quds Force and others to — to cause problems throughout the region.\\xa0 We know that, in one way, shape, or form, they’re resourcing, directing, approving, of whatever operations for Shia militia groups in Iraq that are targeting American forces.\\n\\nSo, I think at the end of the day, again, I feel deep concern for the Iranian people.\\xa0 The important thing is that the Iranian government should focus on them and stop this malign behavior that they’ve been conducting now for over 40 years.\\xa0 I think the entire region, and certainly the Iranian people, would be better off for it.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And I happen to think they want to make a deal; they just don’t know, really, how to start.\\xa0 And they’ve been given some bad advice by former Secretary Kerry.\\xa0 It’s some very bad advice.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is it a bluff on their part, do you think?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And I really think they want to make a deal — which is the Logan Act, but we’d have to look at the Logan Act.\\xa0 All you have to do is take a look.\\xa0 I think they’ve been given very bad advice by Secretary Kerry.\\xa0 I think that — I think they’re dying to make a deal.\\n\\nLook, their country is in trouble.\\xa0 Their economics are shot.\\xa0 They’re in — they’ve got a lot of bad things going.\\xa0 I think they’d like to make a deal.\\xa0 They can get it settled very quickly.\\n\\nNo nuclear weapons.\\xa0 No nuclear weapons.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you feel like you’re — would you be in a position to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They can’t have nuclear weapons.\\xa0 It’s very simple.\\n\\nOkay, let’s let these folks get back to work.\\xa0 Is that okay?\\xa0 Thank you all very much.\\n\\nSo, as we deploy our service members to combat both threats abroad, invisible enemy at home, earlier today I spoke to our nation’s incredible warriors and military families.\\xa0 Spent a long time on the phone with thousands and thousands of families that were hooked in.\\n\\nIn order to stop the spread of the virus, some of these families have delayed planned moves to their next duty station.\\xa0 And in other cases, military families are also waiting longer to welcome home their heroes from deployment.\\xa0 There’s a tremendous burden to bear.\\xa0 And the families have been involved with us for so long, and they are incredible.\\xa0 Without the families, they couldn’t be the great service members that they turned out to be, and they understand that.\\n\\nAnd I must say, protecting our military families is our top priority.\\xa0 So they understand what they’re — what’s happening with respect to the virus — and they understand it well.\\xa0 They’ve been fantastic.\\n\\nAs Commander-in-Chief, I’m deeply grateful for our service members, their spouses, and their children, whose love, devotion, and sacrifice keeps America strong.\\n\\nTo make, procure, and deliver crucial medical supplies to our doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers, my administration is leveraging the might of American manufacturing, supply chains, and innovators across the industry and across every industry.\\xa0 And I just told you about Walmart and I could tell you about many more.\\xa0 Hanes is making protective gear and masks, and we’re making tremendous amounts of product.\\xa0 There’s never been anything like it.\\n\\nAt the same time, I tell the governors, “Get it yourself, if you can, from your local companies and your local warehouses and factories.\\xa0 If you can do that, you should do that.”\\n\\nBecause of the actions that we’ve taken under the Defense Production Act, manufacturers and suppliers are sharing with FEMA and HHS their planned orders and allocations to states and to hospitals all over the region.\\xa0 This enables FEMA and HHS to work closely with states, local governments, and private sector to allocate critical resources to highly impacted areas.\\n\\nWorking together, we’re entirely focused on getting materials to the right place at the right time.\\xa0 So we want it to go directly to a hospital or directly to a certain state location, and ideally, not even hit the states’ warehouses.\\xa0 If we can avoid the warehouses, it’s even better because they go directly into a hospital.\\n\\nAnd one example of that is Ohio — the great state of Ohio.\\xa0 Senator Rob Portman called today and he asked for some help, and got us — did a tremendous job, along with Mike DeWine, the great governor of Ohio, to facilitate a donation of 2.2 million gowns.\\xa0 2.2 million gowns.\\xa0 Think of what that is: 2.2 million to the Strategic National Stockpile from Ohio-based Cardinal Health.\\xa0 Cardinal Health, we appreciate it.\\xa0 And they’re making much more than that and different types of things.\\n\\nWe’re profoundly grateful for their contribution to protect the lives and safety of our healthcare professionals.\\xa0 Cardinal has been working with us very well.\\n\\nFEMA and HHS formed a historic partnership with the private sector called “Project Airbridge” to bring supplies from other countries to the United States, including gloves, gowns, goggles, and masks.\\xa0 These supplies will soon be distributed around the country.\\xa0 We have large cargo planes coming in from various parts of the world.\\n\\nEvery day, new planeloads are landing in cities such as New York, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles.\\xa0 Additional flights have been scheduled, and we’re adding more and more.\\xa0 And they’re actually coming in ahead of schedule.\\xa0 A lot of these flights are coming in with a lot of material ahead of schedule.\\xa0 The amount of usage, the amount of need, is something that nobody has ever seen before.\\xa0 We are getting so much, but no matter how much we get, they seem to use it up very quickly.\\n\\nMore than 17,000 National Guard personnel have now been activated all across our country.\\xa0 On Tuesday, the Vice President sent a letter to the governors, calling on them to have plans in place to use the National Guard to move medical supplies from warehouses to hospitals.\\n\\nSo, a lot of times, we’ll deliver supplies to a warehouse in a state — someplace in New York or in New Jersey or in Connecticut or wherever it may be — and they’re having difficulty getting it moved.\\xa0 So what we’re doing, if we don’t bring it directly to the hospital, is we’ve authorized — it was a special authorization — the National Guard to go into that facility and to move it for the state.\\n\\nSo the National Guard is moving a lot of this equipment and medical supplies into a hospital or into an area where it’s needed by the state.\\n\\nAs I said yesterday, difficult days are ahead for our nation.\\xa0 We’re going to have a couple of weeks, starting pretty much now, but especially a few days from now, that are going to be horrific.\\xa0 But even in the most challenging of times, Americans do not despair.\\xa0 We do not give in to fear.\\xa0 We pull together, we persevere, and we overcome, and we win.\\n\\nThis week, every American heart is joined with the people of New York as they continue to bear the brunt of the pandemic.\\xa0 To every New Yorker: Please know that we are by your side.\\xa0 I love New York.\\xa0 And every day, we will be with you.\\n\\nAnd it could very well be that others take over from New York.\\xa0 There are some areas, some hotspots in other states that are really exploding.\\xa0 Some, like Louisiana, were very late.\\xa0 And then, all of a sudden, it was like an explosion.\\n\\nIn confronting this deadly plague, America is armed with capabilities never dreamed of in past centuries.\\xa0 If you look at 1917, the pandemic, it was something.\\xa0 It ravaged parts of this country but ravaged Europe.\\xa0 Ravaged.\\xa0 They say 75- to 100 million — some people say 50- to 75 million people died.\\xa0 Think of that.\\xa0 And that was a long time ago, over 100 years ago.\\xa0 Very, very — many books written about the 1917, 1918 pandemic.\\n\\nOur doctors are pouring over the virus genetic code, designing potential therapies and vaccines.\\xa0 Our planes are airlifting supplies from every corner of the Earth.\\xa0 We’re watching other countries and they’re watching us to see whether or not — and who’s going to be the first to come up with a cure or a remedy of some kind or even a help, if it can help — and of course, a vaccine.\\xa0 We’re looking very strongly for a vaccine.\\xa0 Johnson & Johnson is doing well, and other companies are doing very well.\\n\\nBut our most powerful asset, our greatest weapon in this effort is the spirit of our people.\\xa0 And we want to keep away, keep a distance.\\xa0 Keep away.\\xa0 If you don’t get it — it solves a lot of problems.\\xa0 If you don’t get it — and you can’t get it if you keep the distance.\\n\\nAmerican spirit is unyielding, unwavering, and unbreakable.\\xa0 It’s incredible.\\xa0 I’ve never seen anything like it — the way the people have pulled together, the unity of this country.\\n\\nSo, together, we’re going to win this war, and the sooner we do, the sooner we can begin to rebuild.\\xa0 And we’re ready to rebound and return to normal lives.\\xa0 We went from the best economy in the history of the world, the best economy that this country has ever seen — the best employment numbers we’ve ever had; 160 million people working, almost; 160 million — to a point where the professionals came to me and they say, “Sir, you’re going to have to shut the country down.”\\xa0 I said, “What does that mean?”\\xa0 They said, “Sir, you’re going to have to shut it down.”\\n\\nAnd we’re going to build it up, and I think we’re going to build it up fast.\\xa0 I think we’re going to have a tremendous rebound.\\xa0 There’s a great energy and a great pent-up demand.\\n\\nAnd as you know, phase three was terrific, and phase four — what passed in Congress — and phase four, if that happens, will be great.\\xa0 I already proposed a — paying almost zero interest on bonds, and I proposed a $2 trillion infrastructure plan, which would not only fix our roads and highways and bridges and tunnels and other things, but will also do something very good.\\xa0 It’s called “jobs.”\\n\\nI’m also asking that restaurants and entertainment facilities go back to the old deductibility from corporations where corporations can buy, because otherwise a lot of these restaurants are going to have a hard time reopening.\\xa0 It takes a long time.\\xa0 And they’re going to have a hard time reopening.\\xa0 So we’re asking for going back to deductibility, where corporations can buy and corporations can go out to lunch, and they pay and they get a deduction on what they eat, they get a deduction on the bill, and same with the entertainment.\\xa0 It’s going to bring a lot of people back.\\xa0 I think it’ll open up the restaurant business.\\n\\nPeople forget that, years ago, they had that.\\xa0 And when they got rid of it, when they ended it for whatever reason — but they ended it — many, many restaurants went out of business, many entertainment-type facilities went out of business.\\xa0 And now is a great time to bring it back.\\xa0 It was — it was a terrible time for that business after they ended it.\\xa0 But this is a great time to bring it back.\\xa0 It’ll keep our restaurants going.\\xa0 In fact, I think the restaurant business will be actually bigger and better than it is right now.\\xa0 So we’re also talking about that.\\n\\nAnd now what we’ll do is we’ll take some questions.\\xa0 And I see Mike is back with some of the folks.\\xa0 That’s great.\\xa0 Dr. Fauci.\\xa0 And we will — oh, how are you?\\xa0 Thank you, Deborah.\\n\\nSo we’ll take some questions, and we make progress day by day.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, yesterday you were talking about a friend you had who is in a coma.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m sorry to hear your friend is going through that.\\xa0 But you said, “This is no flu.”\\xa0 There’s still some people who kind of think of this as the flu, and over the past month, you’ve compared it to the flu sometimes, saying, “Treat it like the flu” or, you know, “Treat it how we handle the flu.”\\n\\nSo what changed your thinking on that or your language on that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think the severity.\\xa0 I think also in looking at the way the contagion — it is so contagious.\\xa0 Nobody has ever seen anything like this, where large groups of people, all of a sudden, just by being in the presence of somebody, have it.\\xa0 The flu has never been like that.\\xa0 And there is — flu is contagious but nothing like we’ve ever seen here.\\n\\nAlso, the violence of it.\\xa0 If it hits the right person — and you know what those stats are — if it hits the right person, that person is in deep trouble.\\xa0 And my friend was the right person.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 When you heard about that with your friend, was that a turning point in your thinking, to some extent?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, well, not a turning point.\\xa0 No.\\xa0 Before that, I knew how — because I’m seeing numbers and I’m seeing statistics that are, you know, not exactly very good.\\n\\nSo — but — but it hit him very hard.\\xa0 He’s strong — a very strong kind of a guy.\\xa0 But he’s older.\\xa0 He’s heavier.\\xa0 And he’s sort of central casting for what we’re talking about, and it hit him very hard.\\xa0 I’ve never seen anything like it.\\n\\nYeah, John?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President — and maybe this is a question as well for Dr. Birx or Dr. Fauci: Senator Lindsey Graham tweeted last night — and we checked today — that there are still flights that are running between hotspots like New York and Detroit, New Orleans as well.\\xa0 A number of flights were completed today.\\n\\nSenator Graham’s point is if you’re going to declare mitigation, should it not be full mitigation —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and you stop people from traveling to these hotspots?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re thinking about doing that.\\xa0 At the same time, we just — you know, to start these airlines and to start this whole thing over again is very tough, John.\\xa0 It’s very tough.\\xa0 And you have them going, in some cases, from hotspot to hotspot.\\xa0 If you notice, they’re usually hotspot to hotspot.\\xa0 Very few flights.\\xa0 New York to Miami.\\n\\nAnd — but we’re thinking — we’re certainly looking at it.\\xa0 But once you do that, you really are — you really are clamping down on an industry that is desperately needed.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But how do you make that calculation as to whether or not you keep the industry afloat —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re going to —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — or you risk spreading contagion?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 That is a calculation that we’re looking at right now.\\xa0 We’re looking at it very strongly.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So let me follow up to that, Mr. President.\\xa0 Not every governor has issued a stay-at-home-order.\\xa0 All of you have made it very clear how important it is to stay home; that we are in a dire situation here.\\xa0 And that’s how you stop the spread, is staying home.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Why not take the power out of the hands of the governors and you just issue a stay-at-home order for every state in this country?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Because states are different.\\xa0 States are different.\\xa0 And I understand that the governor of Florida — great governor, Ron DeSantis — issued one today.\\xa0 And that’s good.\\xa0 That’s great.\\xa0 But there are some states that are different.\\xa0 There are some states that don’t have much of a problem.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What makes them different?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 There are some — well, they don’t have the problem.\\xa0 They don’t have thousands of people that are positive, or thousands of people that even think they might have it — or hundreds of people, in some cases.\\n\\nSo you have to look — you have to look at states.\\xa0 You have to give a little bit of flexibility.\\xa0 I mean, if a state in the Midwest, or if Alaska, as an example, doesn’t have a problem, it’s awfully tough to say, “Close it down.”\\xa0 So we have to have a little bit of flexibility.\\n\\nLook, we’re helping governors.\\xa0 We’re really here to help governors.\\xa0 They’re the frontline of attack, and that includes in purchasing, by the way.\\xa0 We’re here and we’re backing them up.\\xa0 And there’s never been a backup like we’ve given them.\\xa0 We’ve given them billions of dollars’ worth of things — medical supplies and ventilators; thousands and thousands of ventilators.\\xa0 We have thousands under construction right now.\\xa0 We have thousands ready to go in case they need it.\\xa0 There’s never been anything like this.\\n\\nI mean, we’ve — they’ve done really — the people have done incredibly.\\xa0 We’re building hospitals all over the country.\\xa0 We’re building hospitals right now at a rate that has never even been contemplated before.\\xa0 They’re mobile hospitals, but they’re really not mobile.\\xa0 I mean, they’re incredible structures.\\xa0 But we’re building many hospitals: Louisiana, New Jersey, New York. We just finished a massive hospital complex.\\xa0 And we also have medical centers built in New York.\\xa0 I mean, we’re building hospitals at the rate that this country has never done before.\\xa0 And hopefully it’s all going to work out.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A follow-up on DeSantis, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, Mr. President.\\xa0 I just want to make sure we’re clear.\\xa0 On the planes, are you looking at just curtailing routes between certain hotspots, or is it broadly?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re looking at the whole thing, because we’re getting into a position now where we want to do that.\\xa0 We have to do that.\\xa0 And so we’re looking at the whole thing.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You wouldn’t —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And we may have — we may have some recommendations.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And my second question on economics.\\xa0 Just with oil — oil prices are very low.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The Saudis have increased production.\\xa0 I know that you’ve spoken about liking low oil prices, but then there’s also the industry aspect.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s like, from 1950, these oil prices.\\xa0 And that’s when they had big dollars — big, beautiful dollars.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So do you — do you advocate cuts?\\xa0 Do you advocate cuts to production?\\xa0 Do you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, look, we have a great oil industry, and the oil industry is being ravaged.\\xa0 And, as you know, Russia — and I spoke to President Putin; we had a great call.\\xa0 Russia, Saudi Arabia — I spoke with the Crown Prince; we had a great call.\\xa0 But I think that they will work it out over the next few days.\\xa0 If you ask me, I think it’s just — it’s too simple not to be able to.\\xa0 They both know what they have to do.\\xa0 So I think — I have confidence in both that they’ll be able to work it out.\\n\\nBut it’s — it has ravaged an industry worldwide, not here.\\xa0 I mean, worldwide, the oil industry has been ravaged. \\xa0So there was a lot of oil production to start off with.\\xa0 And then, on top of it, it got hit with the virus, and business went down 35, 40 percent.\\xa0 So that business is a tough one.\\xa0 And, you know, they have ships all over the sea.\\xa0 I told you yesterday — all over the sea.\\xa0 Massive tankers that they’re using for storage.\\xa0 They go out and they just sit there.\\xa0 There’s no place to go.\\xa0 They have massive amounts.\\n\\nNow, gasoline is going to be 99 cents a gallon and less.\\xa0 You know that.\\xa0 That’s already starting.\\xa0 It’s popping up.\\xa0 Ninety-nine cents.\\xa0 So that’s like giving a massive tax cut to people of our country.\\xa0 When we try and get the airlines going if — if fuel is costing much less, it helps with getting the airlines, which is always a tough business.\\xa0 Always has been a tough business.\\n\\nBut with that being said, look, I want to get that industry back where it was.\\xa0 We were doing records in that industry also.\\xa0 We want to get it back to where it was.\\n\\nSo I think that Saudi Arabia, Russia, they’re negotiating.\\xa0 They’re talking.\\xa0 And I think they’ll come up with something.\\n\\nI’m going to meet with the oil companies on Friday.\\xa0 I’m going to meet with independent oil producers also on Friday or Saturday, maybe Sunday.\\xa0 But we’re having a lot of meetings on it.\\xa0 I think I know what to do to solve it.\\xa0 But if — if they’re unable to solve it, then I think I know what to do to solve it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can you give us a glimpse of what direction —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We won’t mention it now, but it’s tough.\\xa0 I think I know what to do to solve it.\\xa0 We don’t want to lose our great oil companies.\\xa0 You know, we’re the number one producer of oil in the world.\\xa0 And a month ago, when you said that, it was great.\\xa0 Today, when you say it, it’s not so meaningful.\\n\\nBut I do believe there’s a way that that can be solved or pretty well solved.\\xa0 And I’d rather not do that.\\xa0 I think that Russia and Saudi Arabia, at some point, are going to make a deal in the not-too-distant future because it’s very bad for Russia.\\xa0 It’s very bad for Saudi Arabia.\\xa0 It’s very bad.\\xa0 I mean, it’s bad for both, so I think they’re going to make a deal.\\n\\nYou know, the free market is a wonderful thing.\\xa0 It’s amazing how it can work.\\xa0 But I think they’re going to make a deal.\\n\\nYeah.\\xa0 Yeah, please.\\xa0 In the back.\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr.\\xa0 President, a couple of questions.\\xa0 One for you, one for Mr. Wolf, if possible.\\xa0 Over 5 million immigrants in this country do pay taxes through their ID numbers, yet they will not receive any money in their stimulus package.\\xa0 And no undocumented immigrant will receive any aid from the government during this crisis.\\xa0 How do you suppose they survive during the COVID-19?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, you know, you’re saying “undocumented,” meaning they came in illegally.\\xa0 And a lot of people would say we have a lot of citizens right now that won’t be working.\\xa0 So, what are you going to do?\\xa0 It’s a tough thing.\\xa0 It’s a very terrible — it’s a very sad question, I must be honest with you.\\xa0 But they came in illegally.\\xa0 And we have a lot of people that are citizens of our country that won’t be able to have jobs.\\n\\nNow, I do think once we get rid of the virus, I think we’re going to have a boom economy.\\xa0 I think it’s going to go up rather quickly.\\xa0 Maybe very quickly.\\xa0 And maybe slowly.\\xa0 But it’s going to go up, and it’ll all come back.\\xa0 And I think it’s actually going to come back stronger than what it was because of the stimulus.\\n\\nBut it’s a — it’s a really sad situation, and we are working on it.\\xa0 I will tell you — I’m not going to give you a hard and fast answer because I just want to tell you, it’s something I think about and it’s something we’re working on.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I ask a question of Mr. Wolf?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thanks, Mr. President.\\xa0 A question for Dr. Fauci.\\xa0 Looking beyond, when we’re on the other side of this curve, are we looking at living with some sort of social distancing guidelines essentially until there’s treatment or a vaccine?\\xa0 For example, people looking forward to the summer talk about, you know, going to baseball games, going to concerts.\\xa0 We have political conventions over the summer.\\xa0 Are things like that possible or safe without a vaccine or a treatment in place?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah, I think if we get to the part of the curve that Dr. Birx showed yesterday when it goes down to essentially no new cases, no deaths at a period of time, I think it makes sense that you’re going to have to relax social distancing.\\n\\nThe one thing we hopefully would have in place, and I believe we will have in place, is a much more robust system to be able to identify someone who’s infected, isolate them, and then do contact tracing.\\xa0 Because if you have a really good program of containment that prevents you from ever having to get into mitigation — we’re in mitigation right now.\\xa0 That’s what the social and physical distancing is.\\n\\nThe ultimate — the ultimate solution to a virus that might keep coming back would be a vaccine.\\xa0 In fact, I was on the weekly conference call with the WHO-sponsored group of all the health leaders in the world who are dealing with this.\\xa0 And we all came to the agreement that we may have cycling with another season.\\xa0 We’ll be much better prepared.\\xa0 We likely will have interventions.\\xa0 But the ultimate game changer in this will be a vaccine, the same way a vaccine for other diseases, that were scourges in the past, that now we don’t even worry.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And, Tony, how are they — how are they doing with the vaccines, Tony?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 I mean, the vaccine is — is, as I said, it’s on target.\\xa0 We’re still in phase one.\\xa0 There were three doses that we had to test.\\xa0 We’ve been through the first two doses.\\xa0 We’re on the highest dose now.\\n\\nWhen we get that data — it’ll take a few months to get the data to feel confident to go to the phase two.\\xa0 And then a few months from now, we’ll be in phase two.\\xa0 And I think we’re right on target for the year to a year and a half.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And do you mind me asking: You and Dr. Birx, have either of you received threats of any kind?\\xa0 Or have you been given a security detail, given that you’ve been out here every day on camera, speaking?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Well, I mean, I — anything that has to do with security detail, I’d have to have you refer that question to the Inspector General of HHS rather than my answer that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I follow up on testing, Dr. Fauci?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He doesn’t need security.\\xa0 Everybody loves him.\\xa0 Besides, they’d be in big trouble if they ever attacked.\\n\\nYou know, he was a great basketball player.\\xa0 Did anybody know that?\\xa0 He was a little on the short side for the NBA, but he was talented.\\xa0 And he — he won a game.\\xa0 I read the story.\\xa0 He won a game that was unwinnable against a great team.\\xa0 And his whole team said, “We can’t beat this team.”\\xa0 And he went in and they won the game.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 That was a couple of years ago, but —\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah, a few years ago.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The head never changes.\\xa0 (Laughs.)\\xa0 The attitude never changes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Could I — could I ask Dr. Fauci —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — because I know he loves being up behind the podium so much.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He does.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Like pulling teeth; like going to the dentist.\\n\\nI don’t want to hit you with everything that’s coming along, but a lot of people who are watching television today heard from a researcher named Dr. Jacob Glanville who’s come up with a potential antibody therapy that he has given to USAMRIID.\\xa0 Just wanting to know if you know anything about this; what you might be able to tell people at home about it who have seen it.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 You know, John, I don’t know specifically this individual what they’re doing, but I can tell you there’s a lot of activity that is centered around a passive transfer of antibodies in the form of convalescent plasma, one.\\xa0 The number is to get immune globulin that you precipitate out of the plasma, and another is monoclonal antibody.\\n\\nIt’s based on the same principle of if you have a protective antibody, passive transfer that could provide not only protection, prophylactically, but also treatment.\\xa0 This is an old concept.\\xa0 In fact, immunology was born decades and decades and decades ago with the concept of giving passive transfer of serum to an individual to protect them from an infection.\\n\\nSo it’s — I wouldn’t be surprised if he and a number of other people are pursuing this.\\xa0 It’s the right thing to do.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I follow up on antibody testing please, Dr. Fauci?\\xa0 At what point can we, as a country, expect there to be a widespread antibody testing so we know exactly what we’re dealing with here, as well as other questions such as, you know, when can people, who are deemed to be healthy, donate blood, for example?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 So when you talk about antibody testing, there are a couple of things that you want to do.\\xa0 You want to find out if someone has been infected and whether or not they’re going to ultimately wind up being protected.\\n\\nAntibody testing right now is not the first thing on our priority.\\xa0 It’s something that we need to do is testing to see if someone is infected.\\n\\nIt is very important, ultimately, to be able to get a feel for what the penetrance of the infection was in society for a number of reasons.\\xa0 You get a better feel of what the impact has been, but also you get a better feel of what the herd immunity would be.\\n\\nSo I can foresee, in the future, that when we get the facility, which we’ll have for sure — I mean, ultimately, you can get a test that could do this reasonably easy — and do the kind of what we call SIRO surveillance study; this is very analogous — Dr. Birx and I were talking about that a lot.\\xa0 And that is: Back in the day, when she and I were both doing the HIV/AIDS issues back when we first discovered the virus in ‘83 and we had an antibody test in 1985, we found out by SIRO surveillance representative in different populations that we were dealing with the tip of the iceberg when we saw individuals who were the ones who actually got infected.\\xa0 It gave us a really good feel for how many people are infected, how many are doing well, and how many are getting ill.\\n\\nI foresee that we’ll have that same sort of information, which will be important information.\\xa0 But right now, that’s not our immediate problem.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I know it’s not your priority but can you give a sense of whether it will happen this year —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Deborah — yes — yes, go ahead.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Let me just follow up with that because I think, as I discussed before, we had great — I just want to thank all the epidemiologists and the scientists out there who worked with us over the last four weeks on models.\\xa0 They really — many came forward and really supported us.\\n\\nRight now we’re in talks with a whole series of universities.\\xa0 We have the most brilliant scientists in the world in our universities in state after state.\\xa0 Some of them public health universities, some of them basic science.\\xa0 All of them have received NIH grants for HIV or other development of assays in the past.\\n\\nI’ve talked to a lot of them over the last few days to really ask them to develop these simple ELISA tests that could be used rapidly in their healthcare centers.\\xa0 Because immediately, with a — it’s easy to do; we’ve all developed ELISAs — so in a day or two after development, they could screen their entire hospital.\\xa0 I think that would be very reassuring to the healthcare workers who have been on the front line.\\xa0 We worry about them every day.\\n\\nAnd so I really called on every university in every state to develop ELISAs.\\xa0 You can buy the antigens and the controls online and really work to test entire healthcare communities in your states and support them that way.\\n\\nAt the same time, we worked on, in Sub-Saharan Africa, what we call dried blood spots.\\xa0 So we’re looking at: Could you use that in a community while we work on the point-of-care test, where you just dot blood onto this paper and then that can go into the lab and be analyzed.\\xa0 That would allow us to look in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities immediately.\\n\\nAnd then, finally, we’ve reached out to the developers of the rapid test — the ones who developed it for malaria, the ones that developed them for HIV; it’s exactly the same concept and process — to ask them to rapidly develop these tests because I think we owe it to the frontline healthcare providers not only to provide them RNA tests, but many of them have been on the front line now for four weeks; may have become exposed.\\xa0 We now know there’s asymptomatic.\\n\\nAnd I think really being able to tell them — the peace of mind that would come from knowing you already were infected, you have antibody, you’re safe from reinfection, 99.9 percent of the time.\\xa0 And so this, I think, would be very reassuring to our frontline healthcare workers.\\xa0 And our universities can do that by Friday.\\n\\nSo I’m putting that challenge out to them, to really work on that and do that.\\xa0 That’s what we did in the early days.\\xa0 We had ELISAs up and running within days of having the antigen.\\xa0 And so this is what’s really possible.\\xa0 So we’re not waiting.\\xa0 We’re asking for help now.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, potentially, this could happen soon, even within this month, if people take up that challenge?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 It could happen soon, within this month, if the universities help us.\\xa0 Absolutely.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Birx —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, on Florida —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Governor DeSantis says that he spoke with you before issuing his stay-at-home order.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He did.\\xa0 He spoke to me this morning.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 He has some loopholes in that for —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That, I don’t know.\\xa0 He spoke to me this morning.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — for religious events, for example.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He knows what to do.\\xa0 Very good judgment.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Large religious groups can meet together.\\xa0 That doesn’t really —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Who can — who can?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Religious groups.\\xa0 Like churches can meet.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I didn’t speak to him about it, but he did speak to me this morning.\\xa0 We talked about it.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But your model has full mitigation, sir.\\xa0 Does that go against your model?\\xa0 Because that’s not full mitigation.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t know.\\xa0 I’d have to look at what he did.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Back to the healthcare workers on the frontlines, following up with Dr. Birx, as well.\\xa0 Hazard pay: You have said you have wanted that for the healthcare workers on the frontlines.\\xa0 I know Secretary Mnuchin has mentioned something about that, possibly in the fourth level of the stimulus package.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I like it.\\xa0 I like it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But can you make it happen now?\\xa0 Do we have to wait for a fourth stimulus?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think it’s something we’re discussing in terms of bonus or bonus pay.\\xa0 It doesn’t have to be called “hazard pay.”\\xa0 It can be called —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Could it happen now?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Hey, look, I watch those people go into hospitals that — I know; I talked about one of them, right?\\xa0 But I watched them walk into those hospitals, and they walk in — men, women, young, middle aged, not so many older ones.\\xa0 And I watch — I watched them.\\xa0 They’re almost like — and I think I can take the word “almost” out.\\xa0 They’re like warriors.\\xa0 They’re going in.\\n\\nPeople are cheering.\\xa0 Where there’s a building across the street, the people are screaming, they’re clapping, they’re –they’re like heroes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There’s murals going up.\\xa0 The Empire State Building lit up at the top.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no, I will tell you, I think it’s incredible.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What can you tell them?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They’re like — they’re like warriors.\\xa0 They’re like soldiers.\\xa0 And we’re going to — we’re going to be doing something for them.\\xa0 So whether it’s bonus — because, you know, we’re hopefully going to be over this relatively quickly.\\xa0 It’s going to be vicious for a period of time, but hopefully we’re going to be over this.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And soon?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You have a lot of questions today.\\xa0 Look at you.\\xa0 Do you know this young lady behind you?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’ve never met her before in my life, sir.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 We’re practicing social distancing.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s good.\\xa0 That’s a good idea.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It makes our marriage strong.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s good for a marriage.\\xa0 Right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There are a lot of people who are worried about getting sick, and do they end up in a hospital.\\xa0 People who are uninsured, and will they be crushed by medical bills.\\xa0 You were considering, last month — it was last month already, in March — reopening the Healthcare.gov exchanges.\\xa0 There has been a determination not to do that.\\xa0 Could you tell us what the rationale was behind that decision —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’ll tell you.\\xa0 Mike?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and what — what do you have as an alternative?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 They took that up under the task force, and maybe, Mike, you want to say a few word about this — words about that?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 And what I can tell you is that the President has made a priority, from the outset of our task force work, to make sure every American knows that they can have a coronavirus and they don’t have to worry about the cost.\\n\\nWe were very inspired as well, because of the President’s engagement with the leading health insurance companies in the country that now — so far, two of the top health insurance companies in America have announced that they’re not only willing to waive co-pays on testing, and now testing is fully covered because of the bill the President signed for every American.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But about people who don’t have insurance?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But also, that these two insurance companies have waived co-pays on all coronavirus treatment.\\xa0 And I can assure you that as Congress and the President and the administration begin to discuss the next piece of legislation, we’re going to make sure that Americans have those costs compensated and covered.\\n\\nOur priority right now is ensuring that every American takes the “30 Days to Slow the Spread” to heart.\\xa0 The best thing we can do for one another, for our family’s health, for the most vulnerable among us, is practice those mitigation strategies that the President outlined yesterday for the next 30 days.\\n\\nWe’re dealing with testing to make sure that every American can have a test that needs one.\\n\\nWe’re dealing — we’re dealing with supplies, and we’re making great progress in building personal protective equipment and ensuring that ventilators are available, particularly for the communities most impacted.\\n\\nBut the American people can be confident that as we move into this, we’re going to make sure that our healthcare workers are properly compensated for their extraordinary and courageous work.\\xa0 And we’ll make sure that the financial burden on those who end up contracting the coronavirus and dealing with its most serious symptoms also can deal with those issues and deal with those costs.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Understood, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 But there will be people who don’t have insurance who get sick before any of these mitigation efforts are put into place.\\xa0 And without opening the healthcare exchanges, where can they find insurance?\\xa0 The people who aren’t insured by these companies that are covering the cost of the co-pay, where can people go now to get health insurance if they get sick — before they sick?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, all across America, we have Medicaid for underprivileged Americans.\\xa0 And at the President’s direction, the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services has given unprecedented waivers for states to expand coverage for coronavirus testing and treatment.\\xa0 We’ve also extended waivers for Medicare administration to make sure that people have access to that coverage.\\n\\nBut we’re going to continue to bring opportunities to the President.\\xa0 The traditional systems of Medicaid, in particular, for the uninsured in America —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Could you expand that to cover middle-class people?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, the — I think what we’re seeing health insurance companies do today, John, is really inspiring.\\xa0 I mean, one of the things —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But, again, Mr. Vice President —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 One of the things that’s characterized —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m sorry to belabor a point, but that’s for people who —\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — the President’s approach here —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 That’s for people who already have insurance.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, one of the things that has animated and characterized the President’s approach is the way he’s engaged American businesses to step up and do their part.\\n\\nAnd as the President said many times, we’re — we’re inspired by the spirit of American businesses.\\xa0 I was at distribution center for Walmart today in Southern Virginia, and I saw the way this company that, literally, has already hired thousands of people — these workers are coming to work, the truck drivers are coming to work, farmers are working in the field.\\xa0 Grocery stores made a commitment to the President, a month ago, that no grocery store in America would close down.\\xa0 The food supply is strong.\\xa0 We’re getting food on the table of every American.\\n\\nBut it’s because the President went to these leaders and said, “We need you to step up and do your part.”\\xa0 We engaged health insurance executives early on in this process to waive — to waive co-pays on coronavirus testing.\\n\\nAnd because of the engagement — and, frankly, because of that, that patriotic and compassionate spirit that’s being reflected — we’ve already seen two of the largest insurance companies in the country announce that they’re going to be providing full coverage, free of charge, for coronavirus treatment.\\n\\nI fully expect, I think as the President does too, that\\xa0we’ll see more of that for people that have insurance.\\xa0 And we’ll continue to provide flexibility for Medicaid, for people that don’t have insurance.\\xa0 And we’ll make sure that Medicare has the flexibility to meet this moment for seniors — when we remember that seniors with underlying health conditions are the most vulnerable to serious outcomes from the coronavirus.\\n\\nBut we’ll get through this using the full weight of the federal government and the full strength of the American economy.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 John, I think this: I think it’s a very fair question though, and it’s something we’re really going to look at because it doesn’t seem fair.\\xa0 If you have it, you have a big advantage.\\xa0 And at certain income level you do.\\n\\nI think it’s one of the greatest answers I’ve ever heard, because Mike was able to speak for five minutes and not even touch your question.\\n\\nQ \\xa0\\xa0 No.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So, I said — I said, that’s what you call a great professional.\\n\\nBut let me just tell you, you really are — it’s really a fair question and it’s something we’re looking at.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, I think — I mean, just in terms of a fair question or not, I always endeavor to ask fair questions — but this is a huge worry —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I know.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — for people in this country who are in that donut hole —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’ll look.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — where they don’t have — they don’t have commercial insurance, they don’t qualify for Medicaid.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What do they do?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They’re a certain group.\\xa0 And it’s a pretty big group.\\xa0 We’re looking at it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I mean, we spent the entire 2000 election talking about the donut hole, and it’s still there.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 We are — I haven’t been up there yet though, you know.\\xa0 The other people have been talking about it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No, I mean, this was 2000.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And they haven’t spoken —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This was 20 years ago, we were talking about it.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But they’re thinking about it.\\xa0 They’re talking about it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Gore v. Bush — it was all about the donut hole.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I know, but they’re talking about it in 2020 election, too.\\xa0 And nobody has gotten to it.\\xa0 Nobody has talked about at all.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can you get to it, Mr. President?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think we will, yeah.\\xa0 I think we’re going to get to it.\\xa0 I think we’re going to get to it.\\xa0 I don’t think the other group will get to it.\\xa0 They haven’t even spoken about it.\\xa0 And it’s a big group of people.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So are you committing that there is something you’re going do for —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I’m not committing.\\xa0 But it’s something we’re going to look at.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — for the uninsured, for —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I can’t commit.\\xa0 I have to get approval from it.\\xa0 I have thing called “Congress.”\\xa0 But it’s something we’re going to look at.\\xa0 And we have been looking at it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But in the —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You mentioned, in this next congressional bill, the next — the, sort of, phase four, you would like to see something put in there for the uninsured?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 If there is a phase four, but we’re certainly looking at certain things.\\xa0 We want to help restaurants, entertainment.\\xa0 And we want to help — because it’s jobs.\\xa0 Not that restaurants — it’s jobs; tremendous amounts of jobs.\\xa0 So we’re looking at that.\\xa0 We’re looking at infrastructure.\\n\\nI mean, we — think of it: We will have spent $8 trillion.\\xa0 And, you know, it’s way back.\\xa0 We’re way pulled back.\\xa0 But we will have spent $8 trillion in the Middle East, and yet our roads are in bad shape; our bridges, our tunnels in bad shape.\\n\\nAnd we’re going to be the talk of the world again soon.\\xa0 But we want 2 trillion.\\xa0 We will have spent in the Middle East — and all we got out of it was death and cost.\\xa0 But all we got out of it was death.\\xa0 Millions of people.\\xa0 You have to look at the other side too.\\xa0 Millions and millions of people killed.\\xa0 Our great soldiers — thousands killed; so many wounded, hurt.\\xa0 And yet, when we want to go and fix a road someplace, we want to do what we want to do in our country — no, it’s time that we spend money on our country.\\xa0 That’s what we’re going to do.\\n\\nIt’s time that we start spending on our roads and our bridges and our schools, and all of the things that we’re supposed to be spending on.\\xa0 And people are finally getting used to it.\\xa0 And you could look at all of what we’ve done in the Middle East, way back in so many different places — way back in other countries too, by the way.\\n\\nAnd I’ve gone to other countries that are very rich.\\xa0 I said, “I’m sorry, you’re going to have to reimburse us for our costs.”\\xa0 They don’t even want to — know what I’m talking about.\\xa0 It takes them 20 minutes to figure it out, because nobody has ever asked them to do that.\\xa0 And they’re doing it.\\xa0 They’re doing it.\\xa0 And they have no choice.\\xa0 They have to do it.\\n\\nSo, it’s time that we start spending on the USA.\\n\\nOkay, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, this is a question for the Vice President.\\xa0 On March 9th, you said 1 million tests had been delivered and another 4 million would be delivered by the end of the week.\\xa0 That clearly did not happen.\\xa0 What happened with those projections?\\xa0 What went wrong?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think the test kits were delivered, according to HHS.\\xa0 But the difference is between receiving a test and the ability to rapidly produce a result of that test.\\xa0 And frankly, because of the public-private partnership that the President initiated, now more than a month ago, with our massive commercial laboratories across the country, our team was reported today that we’re now doing more than 100,000 tests a day.\\xa0 More than 1.2 million tests have been performed.\\n\\nStates have established drive-through sites all across the country.\\xa0 In fact, states have been so successful with the community-based and drive-through testing that we’re working to transition over completely all of the federal work on drive-through testing and — and have the states completely manage that process.\\xa0 But —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But you’re saying 4 million tests were delivered by the end of that week?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 HHS was very busy, from early in the year, delivering test kits around the country.\\xa0 But the difference was, as the President said many times, we had an antiquated system where a state laboratory or CDC only had the capacity to process 40 to 60 tests a day.\\n\\nNow, with the commercial labs, literally, those labs are processing tens of thousands of tests every day.\\xa0 And so while we’re continuing to distribute test kits around the country, now because of the partnership with — with companies like Roche and Quest and LabCorp, the American people are seeing the results of those tests more rapidly than at any point in the past.\\xa0 And we expect that will continue to expand.\\n\\nBut the exciting news this weekend about Abbott Laboratories having a 15-minute test to prove is going to put us in a position, we believe, down the road, to get to where Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx want us to be for many of the states that don’t yet have significant outbreak.\\xa0 There’s some 19 states where we don’t have significant outbreak, but we want to be doing the kind of surveillance testing in those states that will allow us, early on, to identify people with the coronavirus, do what the experts call contact tracing, and ensure that, in that state, we don’t have — we don’t have an outbreak of the coronavirus.\\xa0 So —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And many countries all over the world want to know whether or not they can use, especially, our new test that we — that was just developed by Abbott, which is almost instantaneous, which is going to be great.\\n\\nAnd remember this: We inherited — the word is we inherited bad tests.\\xa0 We really inherited bad tests.\\xa0 These are horrible tests.\\xa0 And it was broken.\\xa0 It was all broken.\\xa0 And we fixed it.\\xa0 And we’re doing millions of tests.\\xa0 Sometimes, we send out a test and it’s not used.\\xa0 In many cases, it wasn’t used.\\xa0 But we worked with the states and the testing has been pretty amazing, especially considering the fact that we inherited a very broken system.\\n\\nJeff?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Hi, Mr. President. \\xa0Just to follow up on something you said before: Are you considering a temporary ban on all domestic flights?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I am looking at hotspots.\\xa0 I am looking where flights are going into hotspots.\\xa0 Some of those — some of those flights I didn’t like from the beginning.\\xa0 But closing up every single flight on every single airline, that’s a very — very, very rough decision, but we are thinking about hotspots, where you go from spot to spot, both hot.\\xa0 And we’ll let you know fairly soon.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And what about rail travel?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 A similar thing.\\xa0 We have trains going back and forth.\\xa0 And people don’t think of trains, but we do a lot of transportation business.\\xa0 It’s a very big decision to do that.\\xa0 And we’re pretty late in the process from the standpoint that this is starting — you’re going to start seeing — I think, over the next couple of weeks, you’re going to start to see us hit a top and start coming down.\\n\\nSo we’ll make those decisions.\\xa0 Those are very, very — those are very, very big decisions, from the standpoint of — of the future of our country, in a way — in the future of our country.\\n\\nWe have to get our country back, we have to start moving again, we have to start working again.\\xa0 Now, they’re doing tests on airlines — very strong tests — for getting on, getting off.\\xa0 They’re doing tests on trains — getting on, getting off.\\xa0 But when you start closing up entire transportation systems and then opening them up, that’s a very tough thing to do.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There continues to be a lot of public confusion about the use of masks.\\xa0 What is the way —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Re-use.\\xa0 I love the sterilization of the mask.\\xa0 So, Ohio company — you can sterilize a — the N95.\\xa0 You can — you can sterilize that mask for up to 20 times.\\xa0 Think of that: up to 20 times.\\xa0 We’re throwing them out and they’re very expensive masks.\\xa0 They’re throwing them out.\\n\\nAnd I kept saying — one of the first questions I asked to Dr. Fauci, I said, “Why aren’t they sterilizing or cleaning the mask?”\\xa0 Because I didn’t — you know, it wasn’t my thing exactly when we first heard about this.\\xa0 Nobody else knew it either.\\n\\nAnd now we have a company and, I guess, a number of companies — one in Ohio, a great one — that makes equipment where you can sterilize a mask up to 20 times, which is fantastic.\\n\\nOkay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But what about you or me?\\xa0 What — what about the public?\\xa0 Should we be wearing masks out?\\xa0 We’ve heard lots of different recommendations.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I — I don’t believe — look, this is a big things.\\xa0 A lot of people don’t like it.\\xa0 Some people don’t like it because you’re taking it away from the medical professional.\\xa0 Some people don’t like it for other reasons.\\xa0 I don’t see where it hurts.\\xa0 And it doesn’t have to be a mask; it can be a scarf. \\xa0A scarf is highly recommended by the professionals.\\n\\nI don’t see where it hurts.\\xa0 I think if — frankly, if people wanted to do it — we don’t want to do anything that’s going to take masks.\\xa0 You’re talking about a tremendous amount of masks when you do that.\\xa0 We don’t want to take them away from our medical professionals, but I certainly don’t see it hurting.\\n\\nBut what I do see people doing now is using scarves.\\xa0 And I think, in a certain way, depending on the fabric — I think, in a certain way, a scarf is better.\\xa0 It’s actually better.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\xa0 You didn’t — you didn’t get — go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 I wanted to ask you about social distancing and how it applies to religious organizations.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Some churches, as you know, have continued to hold services, even though you have advised people that they need to practice social distancing.\\xa0 There was a pastor of a mega church in Florida over the weekend who held services that were — that were attended by several hundred people.\\n\\nSo my question to you is: Should pastors be holding services in the middle of this pandemic?\\xa0 And, even if they do, should Americans be going to church?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, my biggest disappointment is that churches can’t meet in a time of need.\\xa0 You know, this is really a great time for churches to be together, for people to get together on a Sunday or whenever — any day and meet.\\xa0 And yet, if you do that, if you do it close, you’re really giving this invisible enemy a very big advantage.\\n\\nSo, it’s — it’s the biggest — I think the single biggest disappointment is you can’t — one of the reasons I said, “Wouldn’t it be great just to — to pick a date?”\\xa0 As you know, I called it “aspirational” — an aspirational date would be Easter.\\xa0 And I will tell you, it’s a — it’s very, very disappointing.\\xa0 But again, you get too close, and if somebody is sick, you’re going to probably catch it.\\xa0 So you have to be very careful.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Should they cancel or —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So yeah, just real — real quickly.\\xa0 Joe Biden’s campaign came out with a statement today —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sleepy Joe.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — saying that Biden — Biden would be open —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Did he write the statement or did some PR person write it?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 As far as I know, the campaign was wide awake, sir, and he — they sent out a statement —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good.\\xa0 For a change.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — that Joe Biden would be open to having a phone call with you to talk about the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s okay.\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Would you take his call?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, absolutely. I’d like to —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You would talk to him about it?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’d like to speak to him.\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 I’d like to — I’d be — he should be able to —\\n\\nQ \\xa0\\xa0 How do you think you could work together?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I — I always found him to be a nice guy.\\xa0 I don’t know him very well, frankly, but I think he’s probably a nice guy.\\xa0 No, if he’d like to call, I’d absolutely take his call.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 You could tell him.\\xa0 All right?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But you have talked about the failings of the Obama administration and leaving you with empty shelves and no plans.\\xa0 They have said you got —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well — and no ammunition.\\xa0 And maybe no ammunition.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 They have said you got rid of the Pandemic Office in the National Security Council.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We didn’t do that.\\xa0 That turned out to be a false story.\\xa0 Now you’re starting to go —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No, no, no, no, no.\\xa0 I’m just —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 What?\\xa0 Are you working for CNN?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m pointing out — I’m pointing out what they have said and what you have said.\\xa0 That’s all.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I thought you were with Fox.\\xa0 Fox isn’t so easy either, don’t kid yourself.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I — this is not about — this is not about Fox or CNN.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Look, John, let me tell you something.\\xa0 You know that’s a false story.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This is just about statements that —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 What you just said is a false story.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m just saying that they have —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 This doctor knows it better than anybody.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m just saying they have accused you of that.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, but you shouldn’t be repeating a story that you know is false.\\n\\nAll right, who — who’s next?\\xa0 Please go ahead, in the back.\\xa0 You didn’t get any.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You talked about Iran and Iran is struggling with the virus —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s very sad what’s happening in Iran.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and a broken economy.\\xa0 Under which conditions would you consider suspending U.S. sanctions?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, look, we have to talk to them.\\xa0 I think we could work out a deal with Iran very quickly.\\xa0 All they have to do is call.\\xa0 I just think that, you know, they’re proud people, and the leadership is proud.\\xa0 They’re proud like all of us.\\xa0 We’re proud.\\xa0 You people are proud.\\xa0 They’re having a hard time picking up the phone, or they’re having a hard time setting up the meeting, but they could fix their country pretty easily.\\n\\nAnd we don’t want hostility, but if they are hostile to us, they’re going to regret it like they’ve never regretted anything before, as per today’s statement.\\xa0 But all they have to do is call or have somebody call.\\xa0 You know, there are channels where we can deal very easily.\\n\\nAgain, I think that John Kerry did a tremendous disservice.\\xa0 I think he violated the Logan Act, 100 percent.\\xa0 That’s what I think.\\xa0 And I think it made it tough for them, because they were dealing with them for years.\\xa0 It was a terrible deal.\\xa0 All of that money — $150 billion, plus cash.\\xa0 Plus cash?\\xa0 Planeloads of cash for a deal that was no good.\\xa0 And it was short-term.\\xa0 Essentially, it was a short-term deal.\\xa0 Who makes a deal for that kind of money?\\n\\nAnd $1.8 billion in cash.\\xa0 I don’t even know what that would look like.\\xa0 That would be — this room would have to be filled up five times with hundred-dollar bills, okay?\\xa0 Who — who makes a deal like this?\\xa0 And then, on top of it, the deal is no good.\\n\\nAll right, how about one or two more?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, Seattle police have reported a surge in calls about domestic violence.\\xa0 A number of groups have raised concerns —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 About Mexican violence?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Domestic violence.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A number of groups have raised concerns that the longer people are stuck at home, the more domestic violence cases there are going to be.\\xa0 Do you share those concerns?\\xa0 And what is being done to (inaudible)?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it could be.\\xa0 It’s another cost of — of not getting our country working.\\xa0 I mean, people are — now some people are getting along great.\\xa0 I’ve also had the oppo- — the exact opposite question.\\xa0 People — families are coming together.\\xa0 They’re actually coming together.\\xa0 They haven’t talked for a long time and, now, all of a sudden, they’re talking again; they’re loving each other.\\n\\nSo I’ve heard that too, but I’ve also have heard domestic violence much — you know, at a higher level.\\xa0 And drug use, because of — in this case, they lose their jobs.\\xa0 They had a great job, they had a great life, they have a great family.\\xa0 All of a sudden, a husband is told that he doesn’t have a job anymore and he’s got no money.\\xa0 And that brings drugs into it, that brings suicide into it.\\xa0 It’s a terrible thing.\\xa0 We have to get our country going again.\\xa0 We did the right thing.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But on domestic violence —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We had no choice.\\xa0 We did the right thing.\\xa0 Other countries tried to use the herd — or the herd mentality.\\xa0 It’s just, you know, something that doesn’t work.\\xa0 If you look at — I mean, just to say, I heard Sweden gave it a shot, and they went — they saw things that were really frightening and they went immediately to shutting down the country.\\xa0 We did the right thing and we did it early.\\xa0 We did it early.\\xa0 And we stopped other people from coming into our country early.\\n\\nBut — but, no, that’s a cost.\\xa0 That’s a — I’ve been talking about that.\\xa0 People will say, “What are you talking about?”\\xa0 But you will have — you’ll have that, you’ll have domestic violence, you have violence, you’ll have suicide, you’ll have drug addiction.\\xa0 A lot of people are going to be lost.\\n\\nWe want to get this open as soon as we can.\\xa0 I mean, I’ll be the happiest person — so will you, everyone in this room — happy when we get the word that this is the time.\\xa0 And we have our common sense, and they’ll give me a decision or they’ll be making certain statements and I’ll — I think I’ll know how to interpret those statements very well.\\xa0 I’ll be with Mike.\\xa0 I’ll be with the task force.\\xa0 I’ll be with a lot of very talented people, including the two people onstage with us.\\n\\nBut, I look forward — that’ll be a great day.\\xa0 That’ll be a great day.\\n\\nAll right.\\xa0 How about one more, please?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, can I ask a question of Mr. Wolf?\\xa0 Can I ask a question for —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — Secretary Wolf?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Chad, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What is the current contingency plan in ICE detention centers where cases of COVID-19 are already popping up?\\xa0 Some people have been released.\\xa0 Is there a contingency plan?\\xa0 And would you release most vulnerable people like children and the elder?\\n\\nACTING SECRETARY WOLF:\\xa0 Well, ICE looks at — on a case-by-case basis, even well before COVID — on looking at certain detention facilities and determining on a case-by-case basis if they need — do need to release individuals.\\xa0 And when we do that, we obviously put them on alternatives to detention as well.\\n\\nIn the case of COVID, we’re looking at vulnerable populations.\\xa0 And again, ICE is doing that in conjunction with CDC and other medical professionals.\\xa0 You know, in some cases, we do need to do that for the health and safety and the wellbeing of those detainees.\\xa0 But again, that’s a case-by-case basis.\\xa0 We’re not going to make any blanket statement that we’re going to release individuals of whole groups at a time.\\n\\nSo it’s really important, and I’ve said it twice now.\\xa0 It’s really a case-by-case basis, determining the health of that particular population or detainee, the facility they’re in.\\xa0 Different facilities have different capabilities, whether it’s an ICE-owned facility, or it’s a contractor-owned facility.\\xa0 And so we’re certainly doing that.\\xa0 We’re doing that today.\\xa0 We’ve done — been doing that for the past several weeks.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can you say how many have been released?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 While you’re up, could you talk about how tight that southern border is right now?\\n\\nACTING SECRETARY WOLF:\\xa0 Absolutely.\\xa0 We have — we continue to build miles of the wall every day.\\xa0 We’re up to over 150, I believe.\\xa0 We’re continuing to build new — new miles of wall.\\xa0 And a lot of folks ask about a replacement wall or new miles.\\xa0 And it’s a new capability on our southwest border that we haven’t had before.\\n\\nAnd so whether you talk to the agents — the Border Patrol agents — they like that capability.\\xa0 They like that impedance and denial that it provides them.\\xa0 And it provides the ability for those agents to focus elsewhere on parts of the border that are very difficult to patrol so we can use our resources in a different way.\\n\\nAnd so we see a lot of benefits from the border wall system.\\xa0 And again that includes not only the physical infrastructure, but the cameras, the roads, the lighting, the fiber-optic cables.\\n\\nAnd we’re looking forward and we’re still well on our track — well on our mark to meet 400 — 450 miles by the end of the calendar year.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Wolf, can I get one more question from you while you’re here?\\xa0 There’s been concern among farmers about being able to get enough migrant labor to keep the food supply moving as we go into the harvest season.\\xa0 What are you doing to address that?\\n\\nACTING SECRETARY WOLF:\\xa0 Well, at the direction of the Vice President and the task force, we are looking at a number of different options with the H-2A workers that you mentioned, on how do we either extend the validity of their visa or looking at a couple of different options.\\xa0 Nothing to announce here today.\\n\\nBut again, at the direction of the President and the Vice President, we’re looking at a very — a variety of different options that I think we will have soon and it will be very beneficial.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What about waiving visa restrictions for —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But I am glad you asked that question because we want the farmers — they’ve had this for years.\\xa0 We want the farmers to be able to get the people that have been working those farms for years or we’re not going to have farms.\\xa0 So they’re going to come in and they’re going to be given a certain pass.\\xa0 And we’re going to check them very, very closely, especially over the next month.\\n\\nBecause remember, after a month or so — I think once this passes, we’re not going to have to be, hopefully, worried too much about the virus.\\n\\nBut we want them to come in.\\xa0 We’re not closing the border so that we can’t get any of those people to come in.\\xa0 They’ve been there for years and years, and I’ve given the commitment to the farmers: They’re going to continue to come.\\xa0 Or we’re not going to have any farmers.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nYeah.\\xa0 One more question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What about waiving visa restrictions for immigrant doctors?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Who are you with, by the way?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I am with Voice of America.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Boy.\\xa0 Amazing.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So what about waiving these restrictions on immigrant doctors?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Who else, please?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 In less than 24 hours, sir, two ships will arrive at Port Everglades with people who are infected with corona- —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re looking at the two ships.\\xa0 Yeah, we have —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Should they be let in?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We have Canada notified.\\xa0 A lot of Canadians, a lot of British on the ship.\\xa0 And they’re coming to take the people that are on the ship back to their homeland.\\xa0 Canada is coming.\\xa0 The UK is coming.\\xa0 And we have a lot of — and we have Americans.\\xa0 We have some people that are quite sick and we’re taking care of — that I’m speaking with the governor about that a lot.\\n\\nAnd it’s a tough situation.\\xa0 It’s a tough situation.\\xa0 You know, I — you can understand.\\xa0 You have people that are sick on those ships, and states don’t want to take.\\xa0 They have enough problems right now.\\xa0 They don’t want to take them, but we have to, from a humane standpoint.\\xa0 We don’t have a choice.\\xa0 It’s like, I don’t want to do that, but we have to.\\xa0 People are dying.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So they will be let into the country?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re going to do something.\\xa0 We’re going to do something.\\xa0 At a minimum, we’re sending medical teams onboard the ships.\\xa0 We’re taking the Canadians off and giving them to Canadian authorities.\\xa0 They’re going to bring them back home.\\xa0 The same thing with the UK.\\n\\nBut we have to help the people.\\xa0 They’re — they’re in big trouble no matter where — no matter where they’re from.\\xa0 Happen to be Americans — largely Americans.\\xa0 But whether they were or not — I mean, they’re dying.\\xa0 So we have to do something.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So they’ll be treated here —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And — and the governor knows that too.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — before being sent on?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re sending a lot of them home.\\xa0 Yeah, we’re sending a lot of them home to their countries, but we’ll be doing something and we’ll be announcing it.\\xa0 You’ll see what we’re doing.\\n\\nBut we’re also putting medical staff onto the ships so that we can — we have to take care of the people.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 At the risk of getting chewed out again —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, you won’t get chewed out.\\xa0 You know that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, there is a — the IRS is requiring people who don’t normally file income tax to file a simple income tax return in order to get their $1,200 check.\\xa0 Is that the way it’s going to be or is there something you can do to (inaudible)?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I had heard that.\\xa0 Now, I don’t know.\\xa0 Do you know that answer, Mike?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re looking into it, Mr. President.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The IRS issued some guidance.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It sounds like it.\\xa0 Yeah, I mean, we’ll get —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s not in the bill, but it’s —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We can get back — yeah, it’s being — it’s a process that they’re working on.\\xa0 We’ll get back to you as soon as we find out.\\n\\nAll right, one more, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you spoke with President Bolsonaro of Brazil today —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I did.\\xa0 I spoke to him.\\xa0 Of course.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — at least according to his Twitter.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 He’s great.\\xa0 He’s a great guy and he’s doing a wonderful job.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But he’s still meeting with his supporters.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 From Brazil.\\xa0 Spoke to him this morning.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 He’s hugging them.\\xa0 So what is your assessment —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And just a very complimentary call.\\xa0 He’s working very hard.\\xa0 He’s got a problem with a virus — got a big problem.\\xa0 And he’s — we talked about it today at length.\\xa0 We had a call this morning.\\xa0 And Brazil is shut down, as you know.\\xa0 They weren’t going to shut it down, but they had to.\\xa0 So Brazil is shut down.\\n\\nThe world is shut down.\\xa0 Nobody has ever seen anything like this.\\xa0 The entire world is shut down.\\n\\nYou go from having the most powerful economy in the world, and from other countries that are doing well, to being everything is shut down.\\xa0 It’s very sad, but we’re going to get it going.\\xa0 And we’re going to be stronger than ever.\\xa0 I really believe that.\\xa0 We’re going to be stronger.\\xa0 We’re going to have a big bounce — a very big bounce when this has gone.\\n\\nAnd I just want to thank the American people.\\xa0 I want to thank these great professionals.\\xa0 And I want to thank the media, because really, for the most part, that media has been very fair.\\n\\nThank you very much, everybody.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nEND\\n\\n7:18 P.M.

       "  'text': 'THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much, everyone.\\xa0 Our country is in the midst of a great national trial, unlike any we have ever faced before.\\xa0 You all see it.\\xa0 You see it probably better than most.\\nWe’re at war with a deadly virus.\\xa0 Success in this fight will require the full, absolute measure of our collective strength, love, and devotion.\\xa0 Very important.\\n\\nEach of us has the power, through our own choices and actions, to save American lives and rescue the most vulnerable among us.\\nThat’s why we really have to do what we all know is right.\\xa0 Every citizen is being called upon to make sacrifices.\\xa0 Every business is being asked to fulfill its patriotic duty.\\xa0 Every community is making fundamental changes to how we live, work, and interact each and every day.\\n\\nAnd I wouldn’t be surprised to see this going on long into the future, when this virus is gone and defeated.\\xa0 Some of the things we’re doing now will be very good practice for the future, including for not getting the flu, which is very devastating also.\\xa0 So some of what we’re learning now will live on into the future — I really believe that: shaking hands or not shaking hands; washing hands all the time; staying a little apart.\\n\\nFifteen days ago, we published our nationwide guidelines to slow the spread of the virus.\\xa0 On Sunday, I announced that this campaign will be extended until April 30th.\\n\\nIn a few moments, Dr. Birx will explain the data that formed the basis for our decision to extend the guidelines, and Dr. Fauci will explain why it’s absolutely critical for the American people to follow the guidelines for the next 30 days.\\xa0 It’s a matter of life and death, frankly.\\xa0 It’s a matter of life and death.\\n\\nI know our citizens will rise to the occasion, and they already have sacrificed a lot.\\xa0 We had the greatest economy in the history of our country.\\xa0 We had the greatest economy in the world.\\xa0 We had the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers that we’ve ever had, by far.\\xa0 And in one instant, we said we have no choice but to close it up.\\xa0 Just as Americans have always done, they will do a job like few have seen before.\\xa0 And they’re proud to do it, and I see that.\\xa0 There’s a great pride going on right now.\\n\\nBefore we hear from our experts, we have a few other announcements.\\xa0 Today, the Treasury Department and Small Business Administration announced further details on the Paycheck Protection Program, which was made possible by the 2-trillion-dollar relief bill I signed into law last week.\\xa0 Nearly $350 billion in loans will soon be available through lending partners to help small businesses meet payroll and other expenses for up to two months.\\xa0 These loans will be forgiven as long as businesses keep paying their workers.\\xa0 This includes sole proprietors and independent contractors.\\xa0 Applications will be accepted starting this Friday, April 3rd.\\xa0 So, on Friday, April 3rd, that’s when it begins.\\n\\nEarlier today, I spoke with leading Internet and phone providers who are doing a tremendous job of keeping our Internet and lines of communication flowing under very strongly increased strain.\\xa0 The business is more than anybody has seen before, because everyone is inside.\\xa0 They’re all making calls.\\n\\nAmong the leaders I spoke to were Hans Vestberg of Verizon Communications, Randall Stephenson of AT&T, Mike Sievert of T-Mobile, Thomas Rutledge of Charter Communications, Brian Roberts of Comcast, John Malone of Liberty Media, Dexter Goei of Altice, Michel Combes of Sprint, and Aryeh Bourkoff of LionTree.\\xa0 Also, Pat Esser of Cox Communications and Jeffrey Storey of CenturyLink.\\xa0 They’re doing an incredible job.\\n\\nIf you look at other continents — if you look at Europe, they went a different route than we did, and much different route.\\xa0 We were talking about that just a little while ago.\\xa0 And they’re having tremendous problems.\\xa0 Other countries are having problems.\\xa0 Other continents are having problems.\\n\\nBut with business at a level that nobody has seen it before on the Internet, it’s holding up incredibly well, and they expect that to continue no matter what happened and no matter how much more it gains, which, if it can gain more than it already is, I don’t know, because they’re setting records.\\n\\nLet me also update you on the distribution of urgently needed resources and supplies.\\xa0 And we have a lot of numbers.\\xa0 I’m going to let Mike Pence speak to that in a little while.\\xa0 But we’re giving massive amounts of medical equipment and supplies to the 50 states.\\xa0 We also are holding back quite a bit.\\xa0 We have almost 10,000 ventilators that we have ready to go.\\xa0 We have to hold them back because the surge is coming, and it’s coming pretty strong.\\xa0 And we want to be able to immediately move it into place without going and taking it.\\n\\nSo, we’re ready to go, and we’ve also distributed — I just spoke with the governor of Michigan.\\xa0 Had a great conversation.\\xa0 And we sent a large number of ventilators to Michigan.\\xa0 We’re sending them to Louisiana.\\xa0 We sent additional ventilators to New York, additional ventilators to New Jersey.\\n\\nAnd, I will say, in New York, FEMA is supplying 250 ambulances and 500 EMTs to help respond to the increasing caseload.\\xa0 That’s a lot of ambulances.\\n\\nIn California, the Army Corps of Engineers is developing eight facilities to expand hospital capacity up to 50,000 beds. \\xa0Fifty thousand. \\xa0And had a great conversation last night with Gavin Newsom. \\xa0He’s doing — he’s doing a really good job. \\xa0We — we’re in constant communications. \\xa0The USNS Mercy hospital ship is operational. \\xa0It’s in Los Angeles and receiving patients.\\n\\nAnd, in New York, as you know, the Comfort — everybody watched that — it’s in place and will be, in a very short while, receiving large numbers of patients.\\xa0 Over a thousand rooms and 12 operating rooms.\\n\\nFEMA has also provided 100 travel trailers to assist with housing needs.\\xa0 And we’re ordering hundreds more.\\n\\nIn Michigan, FEMA will soon deliver, in addition to the ventilators, 250-bed field hospital, and Army Corps of Engineers is evaluating locations to build alternate care facilities.\\xa0 So we’re doing a field hospital, in Michigan, of 250 beds.\\xa0 And we may be doubling it up soon, depending on the need.\\xa0 They’re doing a good job with beds in Michigan, but they may need more than the 250.\\xa0 So, FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers are prepared to go there quickly and get it done.\\n\\nIn Louisiana, we’re delivering two field hospitals to provide 500 new hospital beds.\\xa0 I’ve been talking with the governor, John Bel Edwards, and the Army Corps of Engineers has been really doing incredible work, establishing 3,000-bed alternate care site at the New Orleans Convention Center, which will be operational, believe it or not, this week.\\xa0 So we’re doing a 3,000-bed alternate care site, and we’re also doing a 500-bed new hospital.\\xa0 And that’s in Louisiana, which really got hit.\\xa0 It started off very late, and it was looking good, and then all of a sudden, it just reared up; it came from nowhere.\\n\\nIn addition to the supplies we’re delivering, we’re also giving hospitals the flexibility to use new facilities, including surgical care centers, to care for hospital patients who are not infected.\\xa0 For example, I know that many expectant mothers are understandably concerned about exposing their newborn babies to the virus, and they should be.\\xa0 With our action yesterday, hospitals now have the authority to create special areas for mothers to deliver their babies in a very safe and healthy environment.\\xa0 Totally separate.\\n\\nOver the past two months, the U.S. State Department has organized one of the largest and most complex international evacuation operations in American history.\\xa0 Mike Pompeo has been working round the clock, along with Ambassador O’Brien.\\xa0 Since January 29th, we have successfully repatriated over 25,000 Americans from more than 50 countries, where they were literally stuck — in some cases, locked in.\\n\\nAnd I salute the incredible public servants at the Department of State, as well as their counterparts at DHS and HHS who have played such an important role in doing this.\\xa0 You probably read about the young people in Peru and young people in Brazil, and they were absolutely stuck, and we got them out.\\xa0 Got them — almost everybody is out now, back home with their parents, their wives, their husbands.\\n\\nI want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead.\\xa0 We’re going to go through a very tough two weeks.\\xa0 And then, hopefully, as the experts are predicting, as I think a lot of us are predicting, after having studied it so hard, you’re going to start seeing some real light at the end of the tunnel.\\xa0 But this is going to be a very painful — a very, very painful two weeks.\\n\\nWhen you look and see, at night, the kind of death that’s been caused by this invisible enemy, it’s incredible.\\xa0 I was watching, last night, Governor Murphy of New Jersey say “29 people died today,” meaning yesterday, and others talking about numbers far greater.\\xa0 But you get to know a state.\\xa0 I know New Jersey so well, and you hear 29 people.\\xa0 And hundreds in other locations.\\xa0 Hundreds in other states.\\xa0 And this is going to be a rough two-week period.\\n\\nAs a nation, we face a difficult few weeks as we approach that — that really important day when we’re going to see things get better, all of a sudden.\\xa0 And it’s going to be like a burst of light, I really think and I hope.\\n\\nOur strength will be tested and our endurance will be tried, but America will answer with love and courage and ironclad resolve.\\xa0 This is the time for all Americans to come together and do our part.\\n\\nI appreciate a lot of the media.\\xa0 We’ve had a lot of really good things said.\\xa0 I think only good things can be said when you look at the job that’s been done.\\n\\nI just spoke with Franklin Graham who is an extraordinary person.\\xa0 And Samaritan’s Purse has been — like so many others — just been amazing and so fast.\\xa0 They did it so fast.\\xa0 He’s been doing that for a long time, but I think people are really seeing what they have done.\\xa0 Franklin Graham — a very special family.\\n\\nAs we send planeloads of masks and gloves and supplies to the communities battling the plague — and that’s what it is; this a plague — we also send our prayers.\\xa0 We pray for the doctors and the nurses, for the paramedics and the truck drivers, and the police officers and the sanitation workers, and, above all, the people fighting for their lives in New York and all across our land.\\n\\nI watched as doctors and nurses went into a certain hospital in Elmhurst this morning.\\xa0 I know Elmhurst, Queens.\\xa0 That’s — I grew up right next to it.\\xa0 I know the hospital very well.\\xa0 And seeing it all my life — my young life.\\xa0 And I will tell you that to see the scenes of trailers out there and what they’re doing with those trailers — they’re freezers — and nobody can even believe it.\\n\\nAnd I spoke to some of my friends; they can’t believe what they’re seeing.\\xa0 And I watched the doctors and the nurses walking into that hospital this morning.\\xa0 It’s like military people going into battle, going into war.\\xa0 The bravery is incredible.\\xa0 And I just have to take my hat — I would take my hat — if I were wearing a hat, I’d rip that hat off so fast and I would say you people are just incredible.\\xa0 They really are. They’re very brave.\\xa0 They’re going in and they don’t know — you have — you have lots of things flying around in the air.\\xa0 You don’t know what you’re touching.\\xa0 Is it safe?\\n\\nAnd you also see where you have friends that go into the hospital and you say, “How is he doing?” two days later.\\xa0 And they say, “Sir, he is unconscious” or “He’s in a coma.”\\xa0 So things are happening that we’ve never seen before in this country.\\n\\nAnd with all of that being said, the country has come together like I’ve never seen it before.\\xa0 And we will prevail. We will win.\\xa0 And hopefully, it will be in a relatively short period of time.\\n\\nWith that, I’d like to ask Dr. Birx to come up and show you some of the latest — just the data that has been, I think, brilliantly put together.\\xa0 And, right after that, I’m going to ask Dr. Fauci to speak.\\xa0 And Mike Pence is going to give you some of the recent events that have taken place and some of the statistics that we have that I think will be very interesting to hear.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 If I can have the first slide, please.\\n\\n(A slide presentation begins.)\\n\\nSo always — and that’s what this slide is labeled, is “Goals of Community Mitigation.”\\xa0 Really highlighting that this begins in the middle and the end with community.\\xa0 This community and the community of the American people that are going to have to do the things for the next 30 days to make a difference.\\n\\nI think you know from that large blue mountain that you can see behind me — and I just want to thank the five or six international and domestic modelers from Harvard, from Columbia, from Northeastern, from Imperial who helped us tremendously.\\xa0 It was their models that created the ability to see what these mitigations could do, how steeply they could depress the curve from that giant blue mountain down to that more stippled area.\\n\\nIn their estimates, they had between 1.5 million and 2.2 million people in the United States succumbing to this virus without mitigation.\\xa0 Yet, through their detailed studies and showing us what social distancing would do, what people — what would happen if people stayed home, what would happen if people were careful every day to wash their hands and worry about touching their faces, that what an extraordinary thing this could be if every American followed these.\\xa0 And it takes us to that stippled mountain that’s much lower — a hill, actually — down to 100,000 to 200,000 deaths, which is still way too much.\\xa0 Next slide please.\\n\\nSimultaneously, there was a modeler out of the University of Washington that modeled from cases up, utilizing the experience around the globe to really understand how this information that we have from Italy and Spain and South Korea and China could really help us give insight into the hospital needs, the ventilator needs, and really the number of people who potentially could succumb to this illness.\\xa0 It is this model that we are looking at now that provides us the most detail of the time course that is possible.\\xa0 But this model assumes full mitigation.\\n\\nIt’s informed every morning or every night by the reality on the ground coming in from New York, New Jersey, and around the United States, and is modeled and informed every morning so that it is adjusted so it is up to date every day.\\xa0 This is the model of the predicted fatalities and mortality in the United States.\\xa0 And as the President said, it’s very much focused on the next two weeks and the stark reality of what this virus will do as it moves through communities.\\n\\nNext slide, please.\\n\\nBut this is a slide that gives us great hope and understanding about what is possible.\\xa0 On the bottom of the slide, where you can barely see that blue line at the very bottom, that’s the current cases in California, the cumulative cases in California, where they’re doing significant testing.\\n\\nThe next line up is Connecticut.\\xa0 The orange line is New Jersey.\\xa0 The blue line is New York.\\xa0 The yellow line is Washington.\\xa0 We all remember Washington State.\\xa0 It was just a month ago when they started to have the issues in Washington State, but they brought together their communities and their health providers, and they put in strong mitigation methods and testing.\\xa0 And you can see what the result in Washington State and California is.\\xa0 But without the continuation for the next 30 days, anything could change.\\n\\nNext slide, please.\\n\\nSo I’m sure you’re interested in seeing all of the states.\\xa0 So on this slide is all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\\xa0 But I think it shows in stark reality the difference between New York and New Jersey and other states with similar populations in urban areas.\\n\\nOur goal, over the next 30 days, is to ensure the states that you see — the 48 across the bottom — maintain this lower level of new cases with the hope that we don’t have significant outbreaks in other states, in other metro areas, as the community comes together to work together and ensure that the healthcare providers around the globe and in the United States are strengthened by our resolve to continue to mitigate community by community.\\n\\nThis is done community by community.\\xa0 We all know people are in their states and in their communities.\\xa0 And we’re very dependent on each person in the United States doing the same thing: following the presidential guidelines to a tee.\\xa0 I know it’s a lot to ask because you’ve done it for 15 days.\\n\\nSo if you can show the next slide, please.\\n\\nSo this is what gives us a lot of hope.\\xa0 This is the case finding in Italy.\\xa0 And you can see that they’re beginning to turn the corner in new cases.\\xa0 They’re entering their fourth week of full mitigation and showing what is possible when we work together as a community, as a country, to change the course of this pandemic together.\\xa0 It is this graphic and the graphic of many of the states that gives us hope of what is possible with continuing for another 30 days.\\n\\nAmidst all that hope, I must say that like we warned about Detroit and Chicago, we start to see changes in Massachusetts.\\xa0 New Orleans continues to be a problem of new cases, although they’re stabilizing.\\xa0 And I think it really shows the depth of dedication of the American people to the healthcare providers, because they can see the strain that this puts on every nurse, doctor, respiratory therapist, pharmacists, and laboratory technician.\\xa0 It’s working together to stem this tide of unrelenting sick people coming to their doors.\\xa0 No one has been turned away.\\xa0 No one who has needed ventilation has not received ventilation.\\xa0 But you can see how stressful it is for each of them.\\n\\nSo I know it’s stressful to follow the guidelines, but it is more stressful and more difficult to the soldiers on the front line.\\n\\nAs we started and — we will end with it’s communities that will do this.\\xa0 There’s no magic bullet.\\xa0 There’s no magic vaccine or therapy.\\xa0 It’s just behaviors.\\xa0 Each of our behaviors translating into something that changes the course of this viral pandemic over the next 30 days.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Deborah.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Thank you very much, Dr. Birx, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.\\xa0 So what Dr. Birx has really said very simply is that there are really two dynamic forces that are opposing each other here.\\xa0 As I mentioned several times in our briefings, the virus, if left to its own devices, will do that dark curve that Dr. Birx showed you.\\xa0 The other dynamic force is what we are doing, what we’re trying to do, and what we will do in the form of mitigation.\\n\\nNow, these are very revealing bits of data because you saw what happened in Italy where you make the turn around the curve and you go.\\xa0 That doesn’t happen all at once.\\xa0 It’s a stepwise fashion.\\xa0 And if I explain the steps, which I will, you’ll see why we are really convinced that mitigation is going to be doing the trick for us.\\xa0 Because what you have is you have an increase in new cases at a certain rate.\\xa0 When the increase in new cases begin to level off, the secondary effect is less hospitalizations, the next effect is less intensive care, and the next effect is less deaths.\\n\\nThe deaths and the intensive care and the hospitalization always lag behind that early indication that there are less new cases per day — the way we saw in Italy and the way we’re likely seeing — I don’t want to jump the gun on it — we’re seeing little inklings of this right now in New York.\\n\\nSo what we’re going to see, and that’s — we got to brace ourselves in the next several days to a week or so — we’re going to continue to see things go up.\\xa0 We cannot be discouraged by that because the mitigation is actually working and will work.\\n\\nThe slide that Dr. Birx showed, where you saw New York and New Jersey and then the cluster of other areas, our goal, which I believe we can accomplish, is to get to hotspot places — the New Yorks, the New Jersey — and help them to get around that curve, but as importantly, to prevent those clusters of areas that have not yet gone to that spike, to prevent them from getting that spike.\\xa0 And the answer to that is mitigation.\\n\\nNow, the 15 days that we had of mitigation clearly have had an effect, although it’s tough to quantitate it because of those two opposing forces.\\xa0 But the reason why we feel so strongly about the necessity of the additional 30 days is that now is the time, whenever you’re having an effect, not to take your foot off the accelerator and on the brake but to just press it down on the accelerator.\\xa0 And that’s what I hope and I know that we can do over the next 30 days.\\n\\nAnd as I said the other day and on one of the — one of the interviews, we are a very strong and resilient nation.\\xa0 If you look at our history, we’ve been through some terrible ordeals.\\xa0 This is tough.\\xa0 People are suffering.\\xa0 People are dying.\\xa0 It’s inconvenient from a societal standpoint, from an economic standpoint to go through this, but this is going to be the answer to our problems.\\xa0 So let’s all pull together and make sure, as we look forward to the next 30 days, we do it with all the intensity and force that we can.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Mike, please.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 And to Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci, I know I speak on behalf of the President and people all across this country when I express our great admiration and appreciation to both of you for helping to steer our nation through this challenging time.\\n\\nThe American people have now seen what the President saw when he made the decision at the end of “15 Days to Slow the Spread” to ask the American people to give us 30 more days to continue to put into practice the President’s coronavirus guidelines for America.\\xa0 And as you just heard from the experts, we have reason to believe that it’s working.\\n\\nAs Dr. Fauci just said, there are difficult days ahead.\\xa0 Our hearts and our prayers go out to the families that have lost loved ones and those, as the President has just reflected, who we know are struggling at this hour in hospitals across the nation.\\n\\nBut to each and every one of us, do not be discouraged because what you can do to protect your health, the health of your family; what you can do to ensure that our healthcare providers have the resources and our hospitals have the capacity to meet this moment is put into practice: the President’s coronavirus guidelines for America.\\n\\nIt really is what every American can do: “30 Days to Slow the Spread,” 30 days to make a difference in the lives of the American people, American families, and the life of our nation.\\n\\nAllow me to give you a few brief updates before the President takes questions.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, we continue to work very closely with governors around the nation.\\xa0 The President and I spoke to all the governors, all the states and territories yesterday.\\xa0 And since we were last together, the President and I have spoken directly to several governors around the country, including Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, and other states.\\n\\nAt the present moment, the President has declared 29 major disaster declarations and authorized 10 different states to use full federal funding, so-called Title 32 funding, to pay for their National Guard.\\n\\nAnd, as of this afternoon, FEMA reports some 17,000 National Guard has been activated in states around the country to provide support for coronavirus response.\\n\\nOn the subject of testing, we have now completed more than 1.1 million tests around the country.\\xa0 We’re working very closely with governors around America to — to assist them in drive-through and community testing centers.\\n\\nI spoke with Governor J.B. Pritzker of Illinois today about a testing center that they’ve established in cooperation with the U.S. Public Health Service.\\n\\nWe remind every governor and every laboratory and hospital in the country it’s imperative that you continue to report daily to the CDC the results of those tests to give us the visibility on the data to best inform resource decisions.\\n\\nAlso, we — we reiterated today to governors in person, and also through correspondence to every governor, the importance of using their National Guard, if need be, to move medical supplies. \\xa0FEMA is very busy, as you’ll hear in a moment, delivering literally millions of supplies to states around the country.\\xa0 But we’re urging every governor to make sure to work with their state emergency management team and maybe use the National Guard to move those supplies from warehouses to hospitals.\\n\\nAt the present moment, as the President said, we’ve distributed more than 11.6 million N95 masks, more than 8,100 ventilators around the nation, millions of face shields, surgical masks, and gloves.\\n\\nWe initiated an air bridge that the President announced yesterday.\\xa0 Flights have arrived in New York, one arrived in Illinois yesterday, and a flight will arrive in Ohio in the next 24 hours.\\n\\nFEMA is literally working and contracting around the world with now more than 51 flights that will be bringing vital medical supplies.\\n\\nOn the subject of ventilators, FEMA is currently delivering 400 ventilators to Michigan, 300 to New Jersey, 150 to Louisiana, 50 ventilators to Connecticut, and in the last week and in the week ahead, more than 450 ventilators to Illinois.\\xa0 This is in addition to more than 4,400 ventilators that the President and FEMA directed to the state of New York.\\n\\nWe just want people that are working on the frontlines, that the President just spoke about, Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci spoke about — we want you to know help is on the way.\\xa0 And, at the President’s direction, we’re going to leave no stone unturned anywhere in America or anywhere in the world to make sure that you have the resources and the equipment to do your job.\\n\\nSo again, I want to just say, “Thank you, America.”\\xa0 Thank you for stepping up.\\xa0 Thank you for putting into practice the “15 Days to Slow the Spread.”\\xa0 And thank you for the response that tens of millions have already had for the “30 Days to Slow the Spread.”\\n\\nWe encourage each one of you, as we have governors around the country, to spread the word about the guidelines, listen to your state and local authorities in areas that are more greatly impacted.\\xa0 We continue to urge people in the areas of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to refrain from travel around the country.\\xa0 And people who’ve traveled from that area, check your temperature and self-quarantine for 14 days.\\n\\nYou can see from that chart the unique challenges people in the Greater New York City area are facing with the coronavirus.\\xa0 And we want to do all that we can to protect your health, focus resources on the community, and prevent unnecessary spread.\\n\\nLastly, as the President highlighted yesterday, businesses around America are stepping up as never before.\\xa0 Tomorrow, I’ll travel with Secretary Sonny Perdue to Gordonsville, Virginia, to the Walmart distribution center, just so the American people can see firsthand how the food supply is continuing to roll on 18 wheels and through air freight all over America.\\n\\nAnd we thank again the grocery store operators around America and everybody that’s working out on the highways and byways every day to keep that food supply rolling, and rolling strong.\\n\\nTo the American people though, we just want to assure you that we’re going to continue to work our hearts out — work our hearts out to make sure our healthcare providers have everything they need, that anyone struggling with coronavirus has the support and healthcare they need.\\n\\nAnd I’m absolutely confident, seeing the way our governors are responding and seeing this team the President has assembled in the White House Coronavirus Task Force, confident of the prayers of the American people that we’ll get through this.\\xa0 But it will take all of us doing our part, and we’ll get through it together.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just to be clear, what is the projected death toll, should the people be reasonably good at following these mitigation measures?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0Well, if they’re reasonably good, I guess we could say that — I’d like to have maybe Dr. Fauci or Deb come up and say.\\xa0 I mean, I have numbers but I’d rather have them say the numbers, if you don’t mind.\\xa0 It’s a big — it’s a big question.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So, of course, this is a projection, and it’s a projection based on using very much what’s happened in Italy and then looking at all the models.\\n\\nAnd so, as you saw on that slide, that was our real number — that 100,000 to 200,000.\\xa0 And we think that that is the range.\\xa0 We really believe and hope every day that we can do a lot better than that — because that’s not assuming 100 percent of every American does everything that they’re supposed to be doing.\\xa0 But I think that’s possible.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And it won’t go in the next two weeks?\\xa0 You said that the next two weeks are going to be very painful.\\xa0 Is the bulk of those going to happen over the next two weeks?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 No, you’ll have an upslope.\\xa0 So as mortality — the fatalities to this disease — will increase and then it will come back down, and it will come back down slower than the rate at which it went up.\\xa0 And so that’s — that is really the issue: how — how much we can push the mortality down.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 So our hope is to get that down as far as we possibly can.\\n\\nThe modeling that Dr. Birx showed predicts that number that you saw.\\xa0 We don’t accept that number that that’s what’s going to be.\\xa0 We’re going to be doing everything we can to get it even significantly below that.\\n\\nSo, you know, I don’t want it to be a mixed message.\\xa0 This is the thing that we need to anticipate, but that doesn’t mean that that’s what we’re going to accept.\\xa0 We want to do much, much better than that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But, Doctor, when we look at the curve, it goes much further in time.\\xa0 So we would have deaths and cases for much longer.\\xa0 I mean, we do expect far —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So, if you can put up slide number two.\\xa0 So that’s a generic — I’m sorry, if you can go back to the slides and put up slide two.\\xa0 That’s a — okay, so what I showed you was a generic picture of what happens in an epidemic when you mitigate.\\xa0 So no mitigation; mitigate.\\xa0 This is based on the experience around the globe with this particular virus.\\xa0 And so it does have a tail, but the peak, you can see by this projection — and this is the IHME data — the peak is over the next two weeks.\\xa0 And that’s — and this is tracking mortality, so the number of fatalities from this virus.\\n\\nAnd so that’s the part that we think we can still blunt through the superb medical care that every client is receiving, but also, even more stringent, people following the guidelines.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I can’t see the small characters, but are we seeing death until June?\\xa0 I can’t really —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 This is June.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This is June.\\xa0 So we would still see problems and deaths in June?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 It’s a projection.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It’s a projection, of course.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 So, I mean, just getting back to what I said about the stepwise thing:\\xa0Deaths always lag.\\xa0 So you will be seeing deaths at a time when, as an epidemic, we’re doing really, really well because the deaths will lag.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Fauci, should Americans be prepared for the likelihood that there will be 100,000 Americans who die from this virus?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 The answer is yes.\\xa0 We — as sobering a number as that is, we should be prepared for it.\\xa0 Is it going to be that much?\\xa0 I hope not.\\xa0 And I think the more we push on the mitigation, the less likelihood it would be that number.\\xa0 But as being realistic, we need to prepare ourselves that that is a possibility, that that’s what we will see.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And that’s a very short period of time for that to happen.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 Right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can the country handle that in such a short period of time, within a couple of months?\\xa0 Fifty thousand a month.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 You know, it will be difficult.\\xa0 I mean, no one is denying the fact that we are going through a very, very difficult time right now.\\xa0 I mean, we’re seeing what’s happening in New York.\\xa0 That is really, really tough.\\xa0 And if you extrapolate that to the nation, that will be really tough.\\xa0 But that’s what it is, Jim, and we’re going to have to be prepared for that.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yeah, I think because the model — that model that was from IHME — that’s based and heavily ladened by the data that has come in from New York and New Jersey and Connecticut.\\xa0 So, you know, that can skew to a higher peak and more significant mortality.\\n\\nIf all of the other states are able — and all the other metro areas are able to hold that case number down, then it’s a very different picture, but you have to predict on the data you have, which is heavily skewed to New York and New Jersey.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Getting back to that, that’s really an important slide that Dr. Birx showed.\\xa0 The cluster of other cities that are not New York and not New Jersey — if we can suppress that from any kind of a spike, the numbers could be significantly lower than what we’re talking about.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You got some cities that are not following these guidelines very closely.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 And that’s the reason — my plea at the end of my remarks, Jim, that now is the time to put your foot on the accelerator, because that’s the only thing that’s going to stop those peaks.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Some of the cities are doing very well as you see.\\xa0 Very well at this early stage.\\xa0 But the number — the Doctor said 100,000 — numbers between 100- and 200,000, maybe even slightly more.\\xa0 But we would hope that we could keep it under that.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Do we have the next slide or the slide after that?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Just go up.\\xa0 Yeah, one more slide.\\xa0 Perfect.\\xa0 Yeah, thank you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Would you tell them — would you tell cities that aren’t doing what, you know, New York, New Jersey, Washington — you know, the cities that have been taking charge in all of this — would you urge some of the cities that haven’t been doing this, Mr. President, to get with the program?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I would.\\xa0 But if you see, New York — I believe the blue is New York — New York is having a much harder time than other of the cities.\\xa0 Certain cities are doing actually, if you look down here, an incredible job.\\xa0 They were early.\\xa0 They were very, very firm, and they’ve done an incredible job.\\xa0 This is New Jersey and New York.\\xa0 This is —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Cali- — I mean, remember, California and Washington State were down here, and they had some of the earliest cases.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But we’re seeing places in Florida not doing what New York and New Jersey have been doing, what Washington State has been doing.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But they’re doing very well by comparison.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes, John.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If I could maybe direct a question to you and then to Dr. Fauci as well.\\xa0 We — you told us yesterday that you’re accomplishing — or the U.S., at least, is accomplishing 100,000 tests per day.\\xa0 But we’re still hearing difficult stories from the frontlines of first responders, who you praised so appropriately a little while ago, that they can’t test all of the people that they need to test.\\xa0 Do you have any kind of projection as to when everyone who needs a test will be able to receive one?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I can only say that we’re doing more than anybody in the world, by far.\\xa0 We are testing it — highly accurate tests.\\xa0 These are tests that work.\\xa0 As you know, many tests are being sent to countries, and they’re broken.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yet, it’s still not enough at this point.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re doing — every day, we get — and the word is exponential.\\xa0 We are getting more and more and more, and now we have the new test that you saw yesterday.\\xa0 That’s going to be rolled out, I think, tomorrow or the next day.\\xa0 And that’s going to take only a few minutes — literally, a few minutes to see the result.\\xa0 And it’s a highly accurate result.\\xa0 I mean, tests were given out not by us, by other countries, where there was a 50/50 chance that it was wrong.\\xa0 What kind of a test is that?\\xa0 These are highly accurate tests.\\n\\nBut the new tests that are coming out are very quick, and they were just developed.\\xa0 Abbott Labs did the one yesterday.\\xa0 So we’re doing more than anybody in the world, by far.\\xa0 And they’re very accurate tests.\\xa0 And we’re getting a lot of information from those tests.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The test the President unveiled yesterday, the Abbott Laboratories test — which is a 15-minute test — our team is working very closely with Admiral Giroir and FEMA to make sure that those are distributed around — around the country.\\n\\nEarlier this week — Abbott Laboratories is actually going to be producing 50,000 tests a day and distributing those around America.\\xa0 There’s already the machines in some 18,000 different locations around the country, and they’ve told us they have several thousand on the shelf now.\\xa0 And what we’re doing is trying to identify the areas where we may yet have pockets or, as Dr. Birx often says, where we want to do more immediate testing so that we can do what’s called “surveillance” testing to identify where there may be coronavirus cases, where there’s been very little incident.\\n\\nBut if I could just amplify one other point, and that is: when you look at this chart, go back 15 days.\\xa0 And the reality is that — and this is me speaking as a lay person — but as I’ve listened to our experts, New York and the Greater New York City area have unique challenges.\\xa0 It’s a — it’s a city that we really believe may have had exposure to the coronavirus much earlier on than we could’ve known and had its own challenges.\\xa0 And New York, Connecticut, New Jersey are leaning into this effort.\\n\\nBut when — when we look at this chart for all the other states, including Washington State and California, it really does give evidence that — at least it begins to give evidence that the “15 Days to Slow the Spread” is working and that, in fact, the American people are putting these things into practice in states across the country, including in New York and New Jersey, even though they’ve — they faced a greater magnitude of cases for certain circumstances that are related to international travel in those communities.\\n\\nBut I think the —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But do you need a national shelter in place?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I know —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Something across the country?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think the American people — what I suggest to you, Jim, is that the American people can look at these numbers in the other 48 states, and they can see that in the last 15 days, the President’s coronavirus guidelines were working.\\xa0 And that’s precisely why President Trump is asking every American to continue to put these guidelines into practice for 30 more days.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 May ask for a question for Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci?\\xa0 If I — if I could —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, right now, we’re at about 4,000 deaths here in the United States.\\xa0 You’re suggesting a spike of more than 90,000 deaths over the next few weeks.\\xa0 Do you have a demographic breakdown of the areas that are most at risk and where most of those deaths may occur?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Well, right now — and I think if you ask Chris Murray, he would say he’s using the information coming out of New York and New Jersey and applying that to potentially other states having the same outcomes.\\n\\nI just want to say, again, this yellow line — the yellow line — and this is all corrected for 100,000 residents.\\xa0 So, this is normalized so we can compare apples to apples.\\xa0 This is still Washington State, this yellow.\\xa0 So they’ve been able to, for a long time of measuring cases, not have a spike.\\n\\nSo it’s possible, and we’re watching very closely to make sure it doesn’t have a spike.\\xa0 But that’s what the people in Washington State are doing.\\xa0 This is what every community — so it — Washington State, early, about two weeks before New York or New Jersey; California, a week before New York or New Jersey, really talked to their communities and decided to mitigate before they started seeing this number of cases.\\n\\nAnd now we know that that makes a big difference.\\xa0 Early — as Dr. Fauci said, if you wait until you see it, it’s too late.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And again, do you have a demographic breakdown, Dr. Birx, of where these deaths may occur?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So there’s a demographic breakdown that we’ve discussed before, related to mortality.\\xa0 And it’s as we’re seeing in New York exactly what we saw in Italy: very low mortality.\\xa0 Not to say that young people under 30 or young people under 40 aren’t getting ill. \\xa0They are, but most of them are recovering.\\xa0 So the profile looks identical to Italy, with increasing mortality, with age and preexisting medical conditions.\\xa0 And so that is holding in the same way.\\n\\nBut what we’re hoping is that, through the work of communities — and again, it comes down to communities.\\xa0 This is not — this is communities deciding that this is important to them to not have the experience of New York and New Jersey.\\xa0 And I think — you know, we are worried about groups all around the globe.\\xa0 I mean, I don’t know if you heard the report this morning.\\xa0 There’s 8,000 ventilators in the UK.\\xa0 If you translate that to United States, that would be like the United States having less than 40,000 ventilators.\\xa0 We have five times that amount.\\n\\nSo, I mean, these are the things that everybody is having to face.\\xa0 And I think the United States is in an excellent position from our medical care position, but we don’t want to have to test that system.\\xa0 We want this to be a much smaller epidemic with much smaller mortality.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I just follow up testing question, real quick, before we move on?\\xa0 So the testing numbers — I understand a million tests done; it’s a big increase.\\xa0 But we were told there would be 27 million tests available by the end of the month.\\n\\nSo can you outline where in the supply chain, where in the logistics chain are those other 26?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 (Inaudible) Mike, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, where are the other 26 million tests right now?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think this is — just for purposes of clarifications, there’s a difference between sending a test that can be administered to a test being done.\\xa0 And because a month ago, or more, the President brought together the top commercial labs in America and said we need you to partner with us to create a brand-new system that would rapidly process tests, we’re now at 1.1 million tests, and we believe it’s a fair estimate that we’re testing about 100,000 Americans a day. That’ll continue to grow.\\xa0 It’ll continue to accelerate.\\n\\nBut I think the misunderstanding early on was there were many tests being distributed, many test kits being sent, but under the old system, as the President has described it — the antiquated system — those were being processed in state labs or at CDC or in private labs on a very slow, methodical system that could only produce maybe 30 to 50 tests a day.\\n\\nBut this new partnership that we have with commercial laboratories allows the progress we’re making.\\xa0 But the breakthrough with Abbott Laboratories now moves to point of care, which means you’re going to have devices and tests that people will literally be able to take at their doctor’s office, at a hospital, at a clinic, at a nursing home, and have the results in 15 minutes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So those 26 million tests we were talking about, were those tests under the old antiquated system?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And now — so are we still even using those 27 million tests, or have we just completely moved on to the point-of-care tests?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The answer is yes, now through the new system.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So, even today — which is, I have to say, coming out of laboratories and developed tests and worked on vaccines and then gone to the field to actually combat epidemic — it is disappointing to me right now that we have about 500,000 capacity of Abbott tests that are not being utilized.\\xa0 So they are out.\\xa0 They’re in the states.\\xa0 They’re not being run and not utilized.\\n\\nSo now we have to figure out how do we create awareness, because sometimes when you put an early platform out — like our first platform out when the high speed was Roche — so you get that out, people get dependent on that, and then don’t see that there’s availability of other tests.\\n\\nSo right now, there’s over a half a million tests sitting — capacity — that are not being utilized.\\xa0 So we’re trying to figure out: How do we inform states about where these all are?\\xa0 How do we work through every laboratory association so they’re aware?\\xa0 And how do we raise awareness so people know that there’s point of care, there’s Thermo Fisher, there’s Abbott testing, and there’s Roche?\\xa0 And if you add those together, that’s millions of tests a week.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And they’re not being reported.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 And they’re not — and so those are the —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They’re there.\\xa0 They’re used, but they’re not being reported.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Or they’re not even being used.\\xa0 So that’s what’s really — so that’s what we’re working on.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So why aren’t they being used?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What’s the reason they’re being used?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Because when people get used to a single platform, they keep sending it back to that lab.\\xa0 So it’s getting in a queue to wait to get on a Roche machine, rather than being moved to this other lab that may have Abbott capacity.\\xa0 Because they’re all in different laboratories.\\xa0 And so —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So how do you break that bottleneck?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 I think — well, actually, Admiral Giroir is figuring it out, to really create some kind of visual so that every governor and every health commissioner can see all of their capacity in their countries — I mean, in their states, county by county, so that they know where the tests are.\\n\\nSo we pushed a lot of tests out, but they’re not all being utilized.\\xa0 And so —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I mean, it’s up to the people when they don’t send them back.\\xa0 I mean, they use them, but they don’t send them back.\\n\\nAnd, Doctor, go ahead, please.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 No, I mean, I — Dr. Birx explained it very, very well.\\n\\nI just want to get back, John, to your question.\\xa0 It’s a logical question.\\xa0 When you look at the number, you want to know what the demography is going to be.\\n\\nThis is a number that we need to anticipate, but we don’t necessarily have to accept it as being inevitable.\\xa0 And that’s getting back to what I’m saying about we can influence this to varying degrees.\\xa0 And if we influence it to the maximum, we don’t have to accept that.\\xa0 That’s something we need to anticipate, but I want to do — not I, all of us want to do much, much better than that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, I mean, on that front, what do the models suggest is on the low end if you have full mitigation?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it says.\\xa0 It says between 100- and 200,000.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 That was full mitigation.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah, that was — that was full mitigation.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, Mr. President, it says 200,000.\\xa0 It says 200,000.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It says 100- to 200,000.\\xa0 Anything — it’s a lot of people, right?\\xa0 It’s a lot of people.\\n\\nWell, you didn’t ask the other question.\\xa0 What would have happened — because this is the question that I’ve been asking Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx for a long time, and they’ve been working on this for a long time.\\xa0 The question is: What would have happened if we did nothing?\\xa0 Because there was a group that said, “Let’s just ride it out.\\xa0 Let’s ride it out.”\\xa0 What would have happened?\\xa0 And that number comes in at 1.5 to 1.6 million people, up to 2.2 and even beyond.\\xa0 So that’s 2.2 million people would have died if we did nothing, if we just carried on our life.\\n\\nNow, I don’t think that would have been possible because you would have had people dying all over the place.\\xa0 This would not have been a normal life.\\xa0 How many people have even seen anybody die?\\xa0 You would have seen people dying on airplanes.\\xa0 You would have been seeing people dying in hotel lobbies.\\xa0 You would’ve seen death all over.\\n\\nSo I think, from a practical standpoint, that couldn’t have been carried out too far.\\xa0 But — but if you — if you did nothing, on the higher side, the number would be 2.2 and maybe even more, and on the lower side, 1.6 million people.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Understood.\\xa0 But if 100,000 is the number with full mitigation, how do you push it — how do you push it forward?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah, so —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So — no, we’ll go up together.\\n\\nDR.\\xa0 FAUCI:\\xa0 All right.\\xa0 (Laughs.)\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 We’ve been at this a long time.\\xa0 You go first.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 So, John, it’s an obvious — very good question.\\xa0 If this is full mitigation and it’s 100,000, why am I standing here saying, “I want to make it better”? \\xa0Because that’s what the model tells you it’s going to do.\\xa0 What we do is that every time we get more data, you feed it back in and relook at the model.\\xa0 Is the model really telling you what’s actually going on?\\n\\nAnd again, I know my modeling colleagues are going to not be happy with me, but models are as good as the assumptions you put into them.\\xa0 And as we get more data, then you put it in and that might change.\\xa0 So even though it says “according to the model,” which is a good model that we’re dealing with, this is full mitigation.\\xa0 As we get more data, as the weeks go by, that could be modified.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Why is the model now the top line on the lowball estimate?\\xa0 Why does that not top out at — I think it said 240,000, not 200,000.\\xa0 Is that a change?\\xa0 Is that because the states haven’t been doing enough?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 You know, it just has to do with if you had more New Yorks and New Jerseys.\\xa0 You know, Chicago, Detroit, LA, Dallas, Houston — you know, all of our major cities — modeled like New York.\\xa0 That’s what gets us into trouble.\\n\\nBut I am reassured by looking at the Seattle line, by looking at the LA line, by looking at what California has been able to do, that that is not something that — I don’t believe that’s going to happen.\\xa0 That is the outside case of having 10, 15 metros like New York and the New Jersey metro area.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 New York had community spread pretty early, undetected.\\xa0 So don’t many of those other states, if not more of them who had even less information, aren’t they likely to see the same spike?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Well, California and Washington State reacted very early to this.\\xa0 Yes, Washington State had some of the earliest infections.\\xa0 They have kept it low and steady, and for now, a month, has been tracking it with a small increase in the number of cases but not this logarithmic form of the virus.\\n\\nAnd so that’s the — that’s the piece that we’re trying to prevent.\\xa0 That’s the piece that we’re trying to prevent in New Orleans, in Detroit, in Chicago, and in Boston right now, and trying to make sure that each of those cities work more like California than the New York metro area.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I just wanted to get your thoughts on facemasks.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 We asked you about this yesterday and you signaled you were thinking about it.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Just to end the last topic though — I think I can say this because I spoke to Dr. Birx before and to Dr. Fauci.\\xa0 For whatever reason, New York got off to a very late start.\\xa0 And you see what happens when you get off to a late start.\\xa0 New Jersey got off to — and I think both governors are doing an excellent job, but they got off to a very late start.\\n\\nWhen you look at Washington State, if you remember, that all started in a very confined nursing home.\\xa0 And you had 20-some-odd people, I believe, dying in one home.\\xa0 That doesn’t mean it escaped that home.\\xa0 And so they have a very different statistic than other states.\\n\\nBut, I mean, I remember it very vividly, the nursing home in Washington State where you had many people dying.\\xa0 Every day people were dying in the one exact location.\\xa0 So they were able to keep that, relatively speaking, into that location.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Were you surprised when you saw those numbers, sir?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But on the facial coverage?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 One second.\\xa0 Steve?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Were you surprised when you saw these projections?\\xa0 The numbers are sobering.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They’re very sobering, yeah.\\xa0 When you see 100,000 people, that’s a — and that’s at a minimum number.\\n\\nNow, what we’re looking at — and as many people as we’re talking about — whatever we can do under that number and substantially under that number, we’ve done that through really great mitigation.\\xa0 We’ve done that through a lot of very dedicated American people that, you know, 100,000 is — is, according to modeling, a very low number.\\n\\nIn fact, when I first saw the number — and I asked this a while ago — they said it’s unlikely you’ll be able to attain that.\\xa0 I think we’re doing better than that.\\xa0 Now, I think.\\xa0 We have to see.\\xa0 But I think we’re doing better than that.\\xa0 Because, as John said, that would be, you know, a lot of lives taking place over a relatively short period of time.\\n\\nBut think of what would have happened if we didn’t do anything.\\xa0 I mean, I’ve had many friends, business people, people with great, actually, common sense — they said, “Why don’t we ride it out?”\\xa0 A lot of people have said.\\xa0 A lot of people have thought about it.\\xa0 “Ride it out.\\xa0 Don’t do anything, just ride it out and think of it as the flu.”\\xa0 But it’s not the flu.\\xa0 It’s vicious.\\n\\nWhen you send a friend to the hospital, and you call up to find out how is he doing — it happened to me, where he goes to the hospital, he says goodbye.\\xa0 He’s sort of a tough guy.\\xa0 A little older, a little heavier than he’d like to be, frankly.\\xa0 And you call up the next day: “How’s he doing?”\\xa0 And he’s in a coma?\\xa0 This is not the flu.\\n\\nSo we would have seen things had we done nothing.\\xa0 But for a long while, a lot of people were asking that question, I think, right?\\xa0 I was asking it also.\\xa0 I mean, a lot of people were saying, “Well, let’s just ride it out.”\\xa0 This is not to be ridden out because then you would have been looking at potentially 2.2 million people or more.\\xa0 2.2 million people in a relatively short period of time.\\n\\nIf you remember, they were looking at that concept.\\xa0 It’s a a concept, I guess.\\xa0 You know, it’s concept if you — if you don’t mind death.\\xa0 A lot of death.\\xa0 But they were looking at that in the UK.\\xa0 Remember?\\xa0 They were very much looking at it.\\xa0 And all of a sudden, they went hard the other way because they started seeing things that weren’t good.\\xa0 So they were — you know, they put themselves in a little bit of a problem.\\n\\nNow, Boris tested positive, and I hear he’s — I hope he’s going to be fine.\\xa0 But in the UK, they were looking at that.\\xa0 And they have a name for it, but we won’t even call — we won’t even go by the name. But it would’ve been — it would have been very catastrophic, I think, if that would have happened.\\n\\nBut that was something that everybody was talking about, Steve, like, “just don’t do anything.”\\xa0 “Don’t do anything.\\xa0 Forget about everything.\\xa0 Just ride it out.”\\xa0 They used the expression, “Ride it out.”\\xa0 We would have had, at a minimum, 1.5, 1.6, but you would have had perhaps more than 2.2 million people dying in a very short period of time.\\xa0 And that would have been a number that — the likes of which we’ve never seen.\\n\\nSo, now, when we look at our package that we just approved for $2 trillion, all of a sudden, it seems very reasonable. Right?\\xa0 When you’re talking about 2 million lives, all of a sudden, it seems very reasonable.\\xa0 I must say, a lot of people that have been seeing the more advanced numbers — because these are much more advanced numbers now.\\xa0 You know, when you first started, we didn’t know, and this was a different kind of a virus.\\xa0 And nobody knew that much about it, even the experts. You don’t really know where it’s going.\\xa0 But then they see what goes on in Italy, and they see what goes on in Spain, and you see France is having a very hard time.\\xa0 And other countries having a very, very hard time.\\xa0 But once they see what’s going on, they start making projections.\\n\\nSo, I hope they’re going to be very high projections, but based on everything else, that would be the number.\\xa0 Let’s see if we can do much better than that.\\xa0 I hope we can.\\n\\nYeah, John.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What about masks?\\xa0 You didn’t answer her question about masks.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Masks.\\xa0 Yeah, what’s your recommendation?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I understand there’s an issue with supplies but —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s right.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — if there wasn’t enough for an emergency room?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it’s — that’s right.\\xa0 You know, you can use a scarf.\\xa0 A scarf is — everybody — a lot of people have scarves, and you can use a scarf.\\xa0 A scarf would be very good.\\xa0 And I — my — my feeling is if people want to do it, there’s certainly no harm to it.\\xa0 I would say do it, but use a scarf if you want, you know, rather than going out and getting a mask or whatever.\\n\\nWe’re making millions and millions of masks, but we want them to go to the hospitals.\\xa0 I mean, one of the things that Dr. Fauci told me today is we don’t want them competing.\\xa0 We don’t want everybody competing with the hospitals where you really need them.\\n\\nSo you can use scarves.\\xa0 You can use something else over your face.\\xa0 It doesn’t have to be a mask.\\xa0 But it’s not a bad idea, at least for a period of time.\\xa0 I mean, eventually, you’re not going to want to do that.\\xa0 You’re not going to have to do that.\\xa0 This is going to be gone.\\xa0 It’ll be gone.\\xa0 Hopefully gone for a long time.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, the mitigation steps that are on your 30-day plan, is that enough or is more needed?\\xa0 Have you been discussing that behind the scenes?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re going to find out.\\xa0 We hope it’s enough.\\xa0 We hope it’s enough.\\xa0 We hope we’re at a level where we can say, “let’s go,” because our country wants to get back to work.\\xa0 We really want to get back.\\xa0 Everybody wants to get back to work.\\n\\nNow, I could ask the doctors to answer that question, but we discuss that all the time.\\xa0 What do you think?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have they been recommending harsher mitigation steps?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think we’re very — I think we’ve been very harsh.\\xa0 I mean, if you look at the streets — I looked at Fifth Avenue today on camera and I didn’t see anybody walking on the street.\\xa0 And I’m used to watching that street — you can’t even see — you can’t see the asphalt, you can’t see the concrete.\\xa0 And you look and there’s nobody.\\xa0 There was one car.\\xa0 It looked like it might have been a taxicab.\\xa0 And it was in a time of the morning that normally there’d be a lot of people.\\n\\nI mean, you know, I think — I think the mitigation has been very strong.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, will you confirm your plans to defer tariff payments for 90 days?\\xa0 And, secondly, on infra- —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I didn’t — I didn’t do anything about tariff payments.\\xa0 I don’t know who’s talking about tariff payments.\\xa0 They keep talking about tariff payments.\\xa0 And we haven’t done that.\\xa0 China is paying us — we made a deal with China.\\xa0 Under the deal, they’re paying us 25 percent on $250 billion, and they pay it.\\n\\nAnd I spoke with President Xi the other day and he didn’t mention that.\\xa0 We didn’t mention that.\\xa0 We had a great conversation, by the way.\\xa0 A really productive conversation, having to do with many things.\\xa0 Most of it was on the virus.\\xa0 But, you know, we’re not talking —\\n\\nWho you are you with?\\xa0 Who are you with?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But if I — if I could just clarify —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Who are you with?\\xa0 Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\xa0 Who are you with?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Wall Street Journal.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There’s reporting by the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg that there’s a plan in motion to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I know — that’s incorrect reporting.\\xa0 Well, that might be, but I’m going to have to approve the plan.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — absent China —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The one thing I will tell you: I approve everything.\\xa0 And they haven’t presented it to me, so therefore, it’s false reporting.\\xa0 So therefore, don’t do the story.\\n\\nIf we’re going to do something, we’d — I’d be glad to let you know.\\xa0 There’s nothing wrong with doing it.\\xa0 But we’ll let you know.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\xa0 A couple in the back, then we’ll get back to you, John.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir.\\xa0 Philip Wegmann with RealClearPolitics.\\xa0 I wanted to ask you about individual states issuing stay-at-home orders.\\xa0 What do you think — for instance, in Florida, Ron DeSantis has resisted urges to issue one of those.\\xa0 But he said moments ago that if you and the rest of the task force recommended one, that would weigh on him heavily.\\xa0 What sort of circumstances need to be in place for you to make that call and say this is something you should consider?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Different kind of a state.\\xa0 Also, great governor.\\xa0 He knows exactly what he’s doing.\\xa0 Has a very strong view on it.\\xa0 And we have spoken to Ron.\\n\\nMike, do you want to just tell them a little bit about that?\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, let me echo our appreciation for Governor DeSantis’s leadership in Florida.\\xa0 He’s been taking decisive steps from early on and working closely with our team at the federal level.\\xa0 But let me be very clear on this: The recommendation of our health experts was to take the “15 Days to Slow the Spread” and have the President extend that to 30 days for every American.\\n\\nNow, that being said, we recognize that — that when you’re dealing with a health crisis in the country, it is — it is locally executed by healthcare workers but it’s state managed.\\xa0 And so we continue to flow information to state governors.\\xa0 We continue to hear about the data that they’re analyzing and consult with them.\\n\\nBut at the President’s direction, the White House Coronavirus Task Force will continue to take the posture that we will defer to state and local health authorities on any measures that they deem appropriate.\\n\\nBut for the next 30 days, this is what we believe every American in every state should be doing, at a minimum, to slow the spread.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So unless we see something obviously wrong, we’re going to let the governors do it.\\xa0 Now, it’s obviously wrong.\\xa0 I mean, people can make things — they can make a decision that we think is so far out that it’s wrong, we will stop that.\\xa0 But in the case of Governor DeSantis, you know, there’s two thoughts to it and two very good thoughts to it.\\xa0 And he’s been doing a great job in every respect, so we’ll see what happens.\\xa0 But we only would exercise if we thought somebody was very obviously wrong.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 Your turn.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thanks.\\xa0 I had a question in a minute for the Vice President about the —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — the National Strategic Stockpile.\\xa0 But while you’re at the podium, I wanted to ask about your call with President Putin a couple days ago.\\xa0 I know a big economic concern for a lot of people has been the state of oil prices right now.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So I’m wondering if you raised that with President Putin, if you were able to —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0\\xa0 I did.\\xa0 We had a call.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 gain any new assurances.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It was probably about that, the oil prices, because, as you know, Russia and Saudi Arabia are going at it.\\xa0 And they’re really going at it.\\xa0 And by going at it to the extent that they are, the oil has dropped to a point where I — look, it’s the greatest tax cut we’ve ever given, if you look at it that way, because people are going to be paying 99 cents for a gallon of gasoline.\\xa0 It’s incredible, in a lot of ways.\\xa0 It’s going to help the airlines.\\xa0 But at the same time, it’s hurtful to one of our biggest industries — that’s the oil industry.\\xa0 It’s really — it’s not even feasible, what’s going on.\\n\\nSo I spoke to President Putin about that.\\xa0 I also spoke to the Crown Prince about that — Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Did they agree to do anything?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, I think — yeah, they’re going to get together and we’re all going to get together, and we’re going to see what we can do because you don’t want to lose an industry.\\xa0 You’re going to lose an industry over it.\\xa0 Thousands and thousands of jobs.\\n\\nWe have — I don’t know if you know, there’s oil all over the oceans right now.\\xa0 The boats are all filled.\\xa0 The ships are — they’re renting ships — ships that were dying that weren’t doing well and now, like, they’re — that’s where they’re storing oil.\\xa0 And they’re sent out to sea and they sit there for long periods of time.\\xa0 There’s so much oil.\\xa0 In some cases, it’s — it’s probably less valuable than water.\\xa0 In some parts of the world, water is much more valuable.\\xa0 So we’ve never seen anything like it.\\n\\nBut the two countries are discussing it.\\xa0 And I am joining, at the appropriate time, if need be.\\xa0 We had a great talk with President Putin.\\xa0 We had a great talk with the Crown Prince.\\xa0 We also discussed more so with President Putin, in this case, the virus, because Russia is being hit pretty hard.\\xa0 And we discussed many things — trade.\\xa0 We discussed a lot of things with both.\\n\\nBut in the case of both, we very much discussed the oil and the oil prices.\\xa0 I mean, if you look, it’s $22 but it’s really much cheaper than that if you want to negotiate.\\xa0 Nobody has seen that.\\xa0 That’s like from the 1950s.\\xa0 It really is.\\xa0 You know, to think that it was 50, 60, 70, 80,\\xa0and now it’s 22.\\xa0 But, you know, if you put a good bid in at nine, I think you could probably get what you wanted, right?\\n\\nJohn, please.\\xa0 Then Jim.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you tweeted earlier today that now would be a good time to start looking toward, if there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and work on an infrastructure bill.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Again, you suggested it should be $2 trillion, which is twice what the last one was — or the proposal, at least.\\xa0 Are you anticipating that, like after the economic crisis of 2008, 2009, America will need to have so-called “shovel-ready” jobs ready to go to get people back to work?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, the problem with that one is they had maybe shovel-ready jobs, maybe not, but they never used it for the purpose of infrastructure.\\xa0 So far, nobody has been able to find any money that was spent on infrastructure.\\xa0 I want to use it for infrastructure.\\n\\nAnd one of the reasons I’m suggesting it, John, is we’re paying zero interest.\\xa0 The United States is paying almost zero interest rate.\\xa0 The Federal Reserve lowered the rate — the Fed rate.\\xa0 And, that, and a combination of the fact that everybody wants to be in the United States.\\n\\nYou know, we have the dollar that’s very strong.\\xa0 And I know that sounds good, but it does make it hard to manufacture and sell outside because other currencies are falling and our currency is very strong.\\xa0 It’s very, very strong.\\xa0 Proportionately, it’s through the roof.\\n\\nSo we have a strong dollar.\\xa0 People want to invest in the United States, especially nowadays where they’re looking at safety.\\xa0 They have all of the problems, plus the virus at 151 countries.\\xa0 They all want to come into the United States.\\n\\nAnd so we have a zero interest rate, essentially.\\xa0 And I said, “Wouldn’t this be a great time to borrow money at zero interest rate and really build our infrastructure like we can do it?”\\n\\nSo the plan was — the Republicans had a plan of about 750.\\xa0 I would say they were — were at seven five, where you had the Democrats were a little less than a trillion dollars.\\xa0 The Republicans were a little bit less than that.\\xa0 And I’m suggesting $2 trillion.\\xa0 We redo our roads, our highways, our bridges.\\xa0 We fix up our tunnels which are — many of them in bad shape, like coming into New York, as you know.\\xa0 Really bad shape.\\xa0 And we really do a job on our infrastructure.\\n\\nAnd that doesn’t mean we’re going to do the Green New Deal because I won’t do it.\\xa0 I won’t approve it.\\xa0 We’re not going to do the Green New Deal and do — spend, you know, 40 percent of the money on things that people just have fun with.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But how would you pay for it, sir?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re going to borrow the money at zero percent interest.\\xa0 So our interest payments would be almost zero, and we can borrow long term.\\xa0 People want to be in the United States.\\xa0 They want to be invested in the United States.\\n\\nGo ahead, Jim.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I wanted to get back to the virus.\\xa0 You were saying at the beginning of the press conference that you’re looking at holding back 10,000 ventilators.\\xa0 Is that because you need to pick and choose where these ventilators are going to have to go because of the nature of the pandemic now spreading?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 It’s a good question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And also, I just wanted to ask —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx if it’s possible, after you finish —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 — is that part of the reason why you’re projecting 100,000 to 200,000 deaths?\\xa0 That there are going to be some people who aren’t going to be able to get ventilators or be put on a ventilator?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Actually, just the opposite, because we’re holding back — we have almost 10,000, and we’re holding because we’re going to need them over the next couple of weeks as the surge goes on.\\xa0 You see the chart.\\xa0 We haven’t hit the top yet.\\xa0 And we have to be able to move them immediately.\\xa0 And we can’t take them because it’s going to be very hard to do that.\\xa0 We can’t take them to places that aren’t needing them.\\xa0 Plus, we have requests for ventilators in hospitals and in states and cities that don’t need them, in our opinion.\\xa0 They don’t need them.\\xa0 They won’t need them at the top.\\n\\nSo we’re holding it back for flexibility.\\xa0 We actually just took 600 and we sent them to different locations today.\\xa0 But we have close to 10,000.\\xa0 And we’ll be able to get them — and we’re all set to march.\\xa0 We have the National Guards and we have FEMA.\\xa0 And we’re all set to move them to the places.\\n\\nSo, as per your second question, what we’re going to do is save lives because of it.\\xa0 Because otherwise, we would not be able to get the ventilators.\\xa0 And we don’t know what the hottest spot —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You don’t think we have a ventilator shortage right now?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 In some areas, we might.\\xa0 But we’ve done a great job with ventilators, and we’re having them made — unbelievable.\\xa0 We have now 11 companies making ventilators.\\xa0 Now, they’ll be starting to arrive in the next week.\\xa0 But we’ve also grabbed a lot of them.\\xa0 Some hospitals had more than they were saying, or at least more than we knew about, which is a good thing, not a bad thing.\\n\\nBut we want to be able to have — I guess the word would be “flexibility” so that if the surge turns out to be much stronger in Louisiana, which it could, that we can immediately bring 1,000 or 2,000 to Louisiana.\\xa0 Otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to get them; we wouldn’t be able to say, “Listen, Governor Cuomo in New York, we want to take ventilators away from New York,” and they’ll say, “Well, we can’t do that.”\\xa0 It would be a disaster.\\xa0 So we have great flexibility.\\n\\nNow, when the surge occurs, if it occurs fairly evenly, we’ll be able to\\xa0distribute them very quickly before they need them.\\xa0 But we want to have — we have a reserve right now.\\xa0 It’s like having oil reserves, except more valuable, frankly.\\xa0 But we have a reserve right now.\\xa0 And we’ll be able — and we also have a great team of people ready to deliver.\\xa0 They can move them fast.\\xa0 So when we see it going up in a certain state — and Louisiana could be one, and Michigan could be another with Detroit, because Detroit is having a lot of — a lot of hard time right now.\\xa0 Detroit came out of nowhere.\\xa0 And that’s what happens with this.\\xa0 It comes out of nowhere.\\n\\nSo we are ready, Jim, depending on what happens, and we have a stockpile.\\xa0 And that’s why it’s called a stockpile.\\xa0 Now, a lot of the ventilators and a lot of the other equipment, rather than sending it to the stockpile, we had it sent directly to a hospital, to a location, to a place.\\xa0 So we didn’t have the cumbersome nature of having it come in, unboxed, put in, and then delivered.\\xa0 We have it brought — which they’ve never done before.\\xa0 They don’t do that.\\xa0 Generally speaking, they don’t do that.\\xa0 But we’ve had — I think, Mike, we’ve had tremendous success at doing that.\\xa0 That’s for other items, including ventilators, where it’s brought to the site that needs it.\\n\\nBut we have a good supply of ventilators, and we’re ready to go.\\xa0 We’re all ready.\\xa0 We have trucks ready.\\xa0 We have everything ready.\\xa0 Because, as we’re saying, John, this could be a hell of a bad two weeks.\\xa0 This is going to be a very bad two and maybe even three weeks.\\xa0 This is going to be three weeks like we haven’t seen before.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And should the hospitals be prepared for that?\\xa0 We’re hearing —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think the hospitals —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — some hospital workers are saying that they’re facing what looks like a medical war zone in some of these places.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 They are — they are going to be facing a war zone.\\xa0 That’s what it is.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What about —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’ve heard — I’ve heard some of the paramedics and some of the doctors, they said they were — they’ve been in war zones, they’ve been in — they’ve never seen anything like this.\\n\\nYou look at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens — I’ve never seen — I mean, I look — I just think it’s so — because that’s a hospital that’s near where I grew up.\\xa0 And it’s — it is a war zone, in a true sense.\\n\\nYeah.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, on the ventilators.\\xa0 So we’ve been hearing from governors who say they are fighting amongst themselves, essentially bidding amongst themselves to get these ventilators.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They shouldn’t be doing that.\\xa0 If that happens, they should be calling us.\\xa0 Look, we have ventilators, but we’ve distributed thousands of ventilators.\\xa0 But they shouldn’t be doing that.\\n\\nAnd if they need them that badly, we know.\\xa0 We have pretty good ideas of where they’re going to need them.\\xa0 Some people, frankly, think they need them and they don’t need them.\\xa0 I don’t want to mention names, but there are some people that want them, and it’s really not the right thing.\\xa0 Then you have some people that, I guess, automatically hoard a little bit.\\xa0 They want to have more than they think they need.\\n\\nBut, you know, a ventilator is a very precious piece of equipment right now.\\xa0 It’s hard to make.\\xa0 It takes a long time to make it.\\xa0 It’s complex.\\xa0 Some of them are like the dashboard of an airplane.\\xa0 I mean, they’re very complicated and very expensive machines, and some are much simpler.\\xa0 But we’re ready to go, depending on what happens.\\n\\nBut we have some hospitals and some states that think they need ventilators, and we don’t think they do.\\xa0 Now, if they do need them, we will have them there before they need them.\\xa0 We’ll be able to move very quickly.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you’re confident then —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What about the hydroxycloroquine?\\xa0 Is there any early data on these trials?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Nothing that I’ve heard.\\xa0 I mean, that’s the first question I make every morning.\\xa0 I’ll tell you, I call up — you know, we have 1,100 — 1,100 in New York right now.\\xa0 And we have other locations where they’re — where patients, people are taking them.\\n\\nNow, the good news is, it’s only three days.\\xa0 And, you know, it’s like a seven- or eight-day treatment.\\xa0 The good news is we haven’t heard anything bad.\\xa0 In other words, there have been no catastrophic events.\\n\\nBut we haven’t.\\xa0 It’s a little bit too soon to talk about it.\\xa0 It would be a total game changer, John, if that happened.\\xa0 If that happened, it would be a game changer.\\xa0 And we include that in that, and, I think, in all cases, the Z-Pak.\\xa0 You know what the Z-Pak is.\\xa0 So we’re going to see what happens with the hydroxychloroquine.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are there other — are there other —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, just one second.\\xa0 Steve, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are there other antiviral drugs that are — that have some promise of working soon?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re looking at a lot of them.\\xa0 We’re looking at a lot of them.\\xa0 Some show promise.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I mean, how soon —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think maybe the doctor might want to speak about the vaccines because a lot of — Johnson & Johnson is advanced — very advanced.\\xa0 We’ll see what happens.\\xa0 The one thing with the vaccine is you — it doesn’t help this group, because this group, it’s — you know, you need to test the vaccine.\\n\\nThe one thing with the drug you just mentioned — right? — is that that’s been out.\\xa0 It’s a malaria drug and also an arthritis drug.\\xa0 So it’s been out there for a long time.\\xa0 A very powerful drug.\\xa0 But it’s been out there for a long time.\\xa0 So it’s tested in the sense that you know it doesn’t kill you.\\n\\nBut you may want to discuss the vaccines for a second, Doctor.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nDR.\\xa0 FAUCI:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 But just for a second — before the vaccine — in answer to your question, Steve: There are a number of candidates.\\xa0 The drugs that are now being looked at in various ways — either compassionate use, clinical trials — are generally drugs that already exist for other things.\\xa0 There’s a whole menu of drugs and interventions that are now going into clinical trials that are not approved for anything yet.\\n\\nI mean, for example, things like immune serum, convalescent plasma, or hyperimmune globulin, or monoclonal antibodies — a variety of other things.\\xa0 Right now, there’s a lot of activity going on behind the scenes in the design of the kinds of clinical trials that will give us an answer.\\xa0 Because you need an answer — because if it doesn’t work, you want to get it off the table and go to the next one.\\xa0 So there are a lot of things.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How long does that normally take?\\xa0 Weeks?\\xa0 Months?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, no, it takes at least months.\\xa0 At least months.\\xa0 At least.\\xa0 So, I mean, that’s the reason why you’re seeing a lot of activity with drugs that already exist for other purposes, because they’re already there.\\xa0 But the drugs that you want to show in a good randomized clinical trial, at very best, they’re going to take months.\\n\\nJust one word on the vaccine.\\xa0 You know, exactly like we said: We hope that as we get into the summer, if in fact there are cases out there, when you’re in a phase two or phase three trial — or 2/2B, as we call it — that we might get an early efficacy signal.\\xa0 And an efficacy signal means that even though you haven’t definitively proven that a vaccine works, you get enough information that if it were an emergency, you might be able to have an emergency use authorization for it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 That sounds good.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And I have to say this: Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin — which is, you know, you take it with it, maybe, if you want, for the infection — I think some medical workers are doing that, using it maybe or getting it prescribed perhaps as — for another use.\\xa0 But the word is that some are and some aren’t.\\n\\nI mean, I think it’s not a bad idea to do it, but that’s up to the doctors.\\xa0 But there is a theory going around that in our country and some other countries, people are taking that — that work in the hospitals, that work with the patients — because there is some evidence.\\xa0 And, again, it’s going to have to be proven.\\xa0 It’s very early.\\n\\nYou know, we’re rushing this stuff through.\\xa0 This was supposed to take a long time to be approved, and I prevailed upon the FDA to get it approved immediately on the basis that it was already on the market for a lot of years for another use: malaria, mostly — and arthritis — but mostly malaria.\\n\\nSo we’ll see what happens.\\xa0 But there is a theory out there that for the medical worker, a doctor, it may work.\\xa0 It may work.\\xa0 And if you take it, it’s — you know, it’s been out there for a long time.\\n\\nPlease, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, I just wanted to go back to Jim’s question about the National Stockpile.\\xa0 The governor of Connecticut today —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 About which?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The National Strategic Stockpile.\\xa0 The governor of Connecticut, today, said that he was disturbed to learn that the stockpile is now empty.\\xa0 That’s his words.\\xa0 And he said —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it’s not empty.\\xa0 Let me explain something.\\xa0 What we’re doing — and I thought I said it accurately; I certainly meant to.\\xa0 Rather than having it brought into the stockpile, where appropriate — other than certain things, like we have quite a few of the ventilators, which is not a lot when you look at the whole country actually.\\xa0 It sounds like a lot — almost 10,000.\\n\\nBut we’re trying to have supply sent directly to the states because we save a big state — we save a big — we don’t want medical supplies coming into warehouses all over the place and then we take them from there and bring them to another warehouse.\\xa0 So we’re having it brought from the man- — ideally, from the manufacturer directly to the hospital or the state where it’s going.\\n\\nSo we’re trying to keep it that way as much as possible.\\xa0 Now, in some cases, we are having it brought.\\xa0 Remember this: We also took over a virtually empty — and I say it again, just like we had no ammunition in the military, and we had virtually no ammunition.\\xa0 Well, we had very little in medical supplies, too, in our stockpile.\\xa0 So, for the most part, we’re trying very hard to have it delivered to the site where they need it.\\n\\nYeah.\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 Here, in the United States, domestically, we can practice social distancing.\\xa0 But some of our sailors, specifically on the USS Theodore Roosevelt —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — they’re not able to.\\xa0 They’re in confined spaces.\\xa0 What are your thoughts on that?\\xa0 Should they be offloaded?\\xa0 And then, sir, are you concerned —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m going to let the military make that decision.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\xa0 But are you concerned about U.S. military readiness during this pandemic?\\xa0 For instance, what would happen if, as reported, China was to increase patrols in the South China Sea?\\xa0 What would your response be?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, we’re going to see all about that.\\xa0 Don’t worry about our military.\\xa0 You know, you saw the military put up a hospital in three and a half days with 2,900 beds — with a lot of beds.\\xa0 Nobody has ever seen anything like it.\\xa0 And, by the way, that wasn’t the only one.\\xa0 It wasn’t just at Javits Center; it was at other locations.\\xa0 And now it’s Louisiana, and now it’s New Jersey, and now it’s other places.\\n\\nOne thing that I think is indisputable is, when I watched the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA — working with them — but when I watched the Army Corps of Engineers throw up these hospitals — and they’re complex.\\xa0 I mean, these are incredible buildings, essentially — tents and various things.\\xa0 But they did it in such a quick — such a short period of time.\\n\\nAnd our military is ready like you haven’t seen.\\xa0 And you know who the best — the best guests on the different shows are?\\xa0 We watch shows at night.\\xa0 And I think the best guests that I’ve seen in a long time are the military people, and they’ve never done it before.\\xa0 I’ve watched General Semonite, who I deal with a lot.\\xa0 I say, “General, you’ve got to give us two new hospitals in Louisiana.”\\xa0 “Yes, sir.”\\xa0 And the next morning, they’re building them at 6 o’clock in the morning, and they’re up in three days.\\n\\nI think they’re the best — they’re the best guests you have.\\xa0 I guess, I’m tired of the other guests, in all fairness.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What kind of message do you have (inaudible) —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, Jim, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\xa0 This may be an uncomfortable question, but what would the models have looked like, that Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci showed us, if we had started the social distancing guidelines sooner, in February or January, when China and South Korea were doing those sorts of things?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I’m going to let them —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I know China is not reliable —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’m going to let them answer that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — in terms of what —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — information we’re getting from them.\\xa0 But if we had started these practices sooner, could these models be different right now?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I’m going to let them answer the question.\\xa0 But remember this — and again, I say it, and everybody says it.\\xa0 You know who it says it better than anybody, is Dr. Fauci.\\n\\nI had a decision to make.\\xa0 Maybe it was my biggest decision.\\xa0 China was heavily infected, and thousands and thousands of people were coming from China to the United States. And against the wishes — not even wishes, but they disagreed with the decision — I made a decision to stop China from coming in.\\n\\nI took a lot of heat, even from China.\\xa0 They weren’t exactly happy.\\xa0 I just made a trade deal — a big one: 250-billion-dollar trade deal — and I’m shortly thereafter saying you can’t come into our country.\\xa0 That was a big decision.\\xa0 That was earlier than the date you’re talking about.\\xa0 So that was a big decision.\\n\\nThat was probably — and, by the way, not because I did it; that was probably the biggest decision we made so far.\\n\\nBut if you look at the one graph, the problem New York has is New York started late, but the other ones didn’t start so late.\\xa0 And New York is also more complicated, because, you know, for obvious reasons, but it got a late start.\\xa0 But do you want to maybe answer those questions?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 I think — I don’t know if you can go back to slide two because I wanted to explain two things that I think is really important because we had a lot of questions about mortality and what it meant.\\n\\nOkay, so you see this confidence interval?\\xa0 So here’s the line.\\xa0 This is the confidence interval.\\xa0 This is where we have the ability to push it down.\\xa0 So you have a large confidence interval around the line.\\xa0 And so we’re trying to move that gray down tighter and below the dotted line.\\xa0 So I think that’s really important.\\n\\nAnd then — then, if you can go to the next slide.\\n\\nSo we really can’t answer your question until we can get antibody testing out there.\\xa0 Because what we can’t tell you is in — and we can always do this.\\xa0 There’s always samples in hospitals and other things.\\xa0 It’s the way we really defined the HIV epidemic in the United States; we were able to go back to blood samples when we had the test and really find out where it was and what was going on.\\n\\nWe really need to look in here and really see: Was there virus significantly circulating in early March and late February?\\xa0 And what did it look like?\\xa0 And where was it?\\xa0 And was it all in the metro areas?\\n\\nAnd I think that’s what Dr. Fauci and I are very, very focused on, is getting serology testing out there to really figure out when it came and really have those samples to be able to do that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Because you understand the painful part of my question and — please, I don’t mean to put you on the spot.\\xa0 But —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 No, we understand, but we can’t answer it until —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But there may be Americans at home —\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Until we see that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — saying, “If we had started this sooner, we might not have 100,000 to 200,000 Americans dying.”\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 Well, that makes an assumption that it was here — a lot — there was a lot back here that we didn’t see.\\xa0 And until we have the antibody test, I can’t really answer that.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Just to underscore what Dr. Birx was saying: If there was no virus in the background, there was nothing to mitigate.\\xa0 If there was virus there that we didn’t know about, then the answer to your question is probably yes.\\n\\nNow, the only trouble with that is that whenever you come out and say something like that, it always becomes almost a soundbite that gets taken out of context.\\n\\nBut I think that it’s very important what Dr. Birx has said — is that if there was covert infections here that we didn’t know about and we didn’t mitigate them, then they would have made a difference.\\xa0 If there was virtually nothing there, then there’s nothing to mitigate.\\xa0 And I don’t know the answer to your question.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But they were early.\\xa0 They started early.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But we were watching North — South Korea, excuse me, and China and Italy, and we weren’t taking action when those countries were spiking.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Right, sure.\\xa0 In a perfect world, it would have been nice to know what was going on there.\\xa0 We didn’t.\\xa0 But I believe, Jim, that we acted very, very early on that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But if we had adequate testing, would we have known?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 We would have known the same thing.\\xa0 We inherited obsolete tests.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Can I — can I speak to that too, as well?\\xa0 The President made reference to the fact — January 31, he suspended all travel from China.\\xa0 Shortly thereafter, we issued strong travel advisories for the sections of Italy implicated and sections of South Korea, and we reached agreements with those countries to screen all passengers from all airports coming into the United States of America.\\n\\nThe President’s initial efforts were designed at preventing the coronavirus from coming into the United States.\\xa0 And what our experts have told us again and again at the Coronavirus Task Force is that those actions bought us a significant amount of time on this curve to respond with the kind of mitigation efforts, standing up resources, testing, and supplies that are in effect.\\n\\nBut we went from a prevention strategy the President acted on before the month of January was over to a mitigation strategy, which continues to this day.\\n\\nAnd if I can also say just — just to every American: All the questions about resources are very important.\\xa0 And I can assure you that the President and our task force are preoccupied with these issues and working with governors hour by hour to meet those needs.\\xa0 But if Americans will put into practice these guidelines for another 30 days, they’ll do their part to lower the curve and save lives, most importantly, and limit the burden on our hospitals and our healthcare system in the country significantly.\\n\\nAnd so, make no mistake about it:\\xa0While we’re going to work our hearts out and leave no stone unturned to find the resources, the masks, the ventilators that we need — and we are going to meet that moment with the full energy of the American economy and the whole of the American government — the American people have a role to play in preserving that medical capacity in a way that will ensure that people that are caught up in the coronavirus, particularly those that are vulnerable to the most serious outcomes, which are seniors with serious underlying health conditions or anyone with an immunodeficiency, have the resources, the support, and the healthcare that every American family would want their loved one to have.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A question for Dr. Fauci.\\xa0 Mr. President?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But I do think we were very early, but I also think that we were very smart because we stopped China.\\xa0 We had never done that before.\\xa0 You know, we had never closed our borders before, as I read — I read.\\xa0 I don’t know, maybe that’s not right.\\n\\nAnd Dr. Fauci had also said that was a — that was — I think it was maybe the biggest moment because we were stopping the source.\\xa0 We were stopping the infection.\\xa0 But we also stopped Europe very shortly thereafter.\\xa0 That was a big decision.\\xa0 That was not an easy decision, either.\\xa0 I stopped them a long time before people started stopping anyone.\\xa0 So we stopped China.\\xa0 We stopped Europe.\\xa0 We stopped all of Europe.\\xa0 And then ultimately, we stopped UK, Ireland.\\n\\nYes.\\xa0 In the back.\\xa0 The very back.\\xa0 Please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President and the team, going back to hydroxychloroquine, how many clinical trial tests, numerically, would you like to see before you put a stamp of approval on it?\\xa0 Because it’s — there are clinical trials being — taking place around the world right now.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You could answer that, please.\\xa0 Sure, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is there a number?\\xa0 How many cases would you like to see?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 That is an FDA decision and it really depends on a variety of factors.\\xa0 What I would like to see: a clinical trial that has a comparison to something that is comparable to what it means without the drug.\\n\\nI mean, I keep saying it.\\xa0 I say it all the time and I’ll say it again: It’s a controlled trial that compares it to something meaningful.\\xa0 When that —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are there particular trials that you’re watching taking place around the world right now?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 Well, there are a number of trials going on, not only in the United States, but also in other parts of the world.\\n\\nYou know, right now, it’s too early to make any determination, but I just want to get back to what I say all the time: The definitive way that you get an answer is by doing a randomized, controlled, clinical trial.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Fauci, on social distancing.\\xa0 Or Mr. President —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You’re talking about the chloroquine?\\xa0 Is that what you’re talking about?\\xa0 In — specifically, per the last question?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 Hydroxychloroquine.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 No, there are trials going on.\\xa0 But there are also trials going on — we’re trying them on people that are now sick.\\xa0 That’s a very important — that’s a very important trial, to me.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But we know that there are cocktails being experimented with around the world.\\xa0 So, my question was really, like: Are there specific —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re watching whatever happens around the world.\\xa0 We’re watching those trials very closely.\\xa0 Yeah.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mitch McConnell had a line today.\\xa0 He was on —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Mitch?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mitch McConnell.\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 He said that impeachment diverted the attention of the government.\\xa0 Do you think that, in any way?\\xa0 This was happening and building at the same time.\\xa0 Did it divert your attention or your team’s attention or the Vice President’s attention?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I don’t like to think I did.\\xa0 I think I handled it very well, but I guess it probably did.\\xa0 I mean, I got impeached.\\xa0 I think, you know, I certainly devoted a little time to thinking about it, right?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (Inaudible) the pandemic?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So, but think of it: It was a hoax.\\xa0 It was a total hoax.\\xa0 And when you think that I got impeached only because they had a majority in the House.\\xa0 They didn’t get one — they didn’t get one Republican vote — 196 to nothing.\\xa0 Not one Republican.\\xa0 It’s nev- — I don’t think it’s ever happened.\\xa0 The Republicans stuck together and they stuck together in the Senate — 52 to a half.\\xa0 A half.\\n\\nSo, you know, when you say that — yeah, I think it took a lot of — I see them going and saying about speed.\\xa0 Well, they probably illegally impeached me in the sense that, if you look at the FBI today — with what happened, the horrible things — nobody cares about that now because all they’re thinking about is the virus, and that’s okay with me.\\n\\nBut you look at the report that came out from IG Horowitz; it’s disgraceful what went on.\\xa0 It’s disgraceful.\\xa0 It’s a total disgrace.\\xa0 They got caught in the act.\\xa0 But you know what?\\xa0 We won’t talk about that now.\\xa0 Did it divert my attention?\\xa0 I think I’m getting A-pluses for the way I handled myself during a phony impeachment.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 It was a hoax.\\n\\nBut certainly, I guess, I thought of it.\\xa0 And I think I probably acted — I don’t think I would have done any better had I not been impeached.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 And I think that’s a great tribute to something; maybe it’s a tribute to me.\\xa0 But I don’t think I would have acted any differently or I don’t think I would have acted any faster.\\n\\nBut the Democrats, their whole — their whole life, their whole being, their whole existence was to try and get me out of office any way they can, even if it was a phony deal.\\xa0 And it was a phony deal.\\xa0 And it turned out — and all you have to do is look today at the FBI reports.\\xa0 Take a look at what the FBI did.\\xa0 Take a look at the people.\\xa0 Take a look at Comey’s report — 78 pages of total kill.\\xa0 Take a look at that.\\xa0 Take a look at the report on McCabe.\\xa0 Just read it and you’ll see how horrible it was.\\xa0 And you know what?\\xa0 I don’t think this country is going to take it, if you want to know the truth.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Was there some call you would have had time to make?\\xa0 Is there — how did it take you out of the game?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What guidance are you offering to Florida when it comes to the two Holland America cruise ships that are seeking to dock here?\\xa0 Many are sick and —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Well, I’ll be speaking — I’m going to be spea- — in fact, he has a call in to me and we’ll be speaking to — we’ll be speaking to the governor and we’ll be speaking to him soon.\\n\\nBut there’s a case — we have two ships.\\xa0 There are people that are sick on the ship.\\xa0 And we don’t want to be — like, they’re going to be ghost ships.\\xa0 You know, people turn those ships away.\\n\\nThere was a ship, as you know, in a certain part of Asia, and, from port to port, nobody would take it.\\xa0 But in the meantime, you have people that are dying on the ship or at least very sick, but they’re dying on the ship.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So what is —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So, I’m going to — I’m going to — you know, I’m going to do what’s right, not only for us, but for humanity.\\xa0 I mean, these are two big ships and they have a lot of very sick people.\\xa0 And I’ll be speaking to — I’ll be speaking to the governor.\\n\\nLet’s do just a couple of more back here.\\xa0 Yeah, go ahead please.\\xa0 We’ll get — we’ll get — go ahead please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 I was hoping you could —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Do you ever run out of questions, you people?\\xa0 It’s the most unbelievable thing.\\xa0 You go through the room —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 But I have nothing else to do.\\xa0 So if you want us — I mean, if you want.\\xa0 Should we keep it going, John?\\xa0 I think so.\\xa0 Let’s go.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Would you clarify something for me, please?\\xa0 Andrew Cuomo, today, said that the system that you have, where governors are trying to get ventilators, “it’s like being on eBay with 50 other states bidding on a ventilator,” plus FEMA.\\xa0 And then you just said tonight, “They shouldn’t be doing that.”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You mean he was — he was complaining?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, he said —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Say it.\\xa0 Say it.\\xa0 What did he say exactly?\\xa0 What did say?\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 He said that when you have states competing for ventilators and medical care, “it’s like being on eBay with 50 other states bidding on a ventilator,” plus FEMA.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, he shouldn’t be complaining because we gave him a lot of ventilators.\\xa0 And if you take a look at the chart — it’s down — but I wish he got going a little bit sooner.\\n\\nBut we gave him a lot of ventilators.\\xa0 And you know what?\\xa0 He has a lot of ventilators.\\xa0 The problem is: With some people, no matter what you give, it’s never enough.\\xa0 It’s never enough.\\xa0 Like, they’ll say, “How’s Trump doing?”\\xa0 And you’re a Democrat.\\xa0 Some of them said, “Really good.”\\xa0 I’ll tell you, Gavin Newsom, from California — who is doing a good job, by the way — and others said, “Really good.”\\n\\nBut, you know, generally, your natural reflex — “How’s Trump doing?”\\xa0 You ask that question to a Democrat.\\xa0 “Uh, well, uh, we don’t like it.”\\xa0 “Oh, really?\\xa0 You don’t like it?”\\xa0 We’re getting very high marks.\\xa0 But I’m not doing this for marks; I’m doing this to save lives.\\n\\nWhen John acted —\\n\\n(Cross-talk.)\\n\\nWait.\\xa0 When John saw the numbers and when Jim saw those numbers, they’re shocking numbers.\\xa0 You know, you’re talking about deaths.\\xa0 Even at the low end, you were shocked when you see 100- and 120,000 and 200,000 people over, potentially, a very short period of time.\\n\\nI want to save lives.\\xa0 I’m not doing this for any other reason.\\xa0 I want to save lives.\\n\\nBut the governor of New York has gotten, I think, maybe — probably has gotten more than anybody.\\xa0 He’s gotten four hospitals.\\xa0 He’s gotten four medical tents.\\xa0 He’s gotten a ship, the likes of which nobody has ever seen before — other than Los Angeles, which has the twin.\\n\\nI mean, we’ve done a lot.\\xa0 But many ventilators were sent to New York.\\xa0 And Mayor de Blasio — I’m getting along with Mayor de Blasio great and I think he’s very happy with the job we’re doing too.\\xa0 We’re sending a lot of — actually, Mayor de Blasio had an interesting request.\\xa0 He wanted people.\\xa0 And we’re sending medical people.\\n\\nYou know, a lot of people — a lot of the states aren’t having a problem with ventilators; they’re having a problem getting medical people.\\xa0 And we’re sending a lot of people in — military, very talented people.\\n\\nWho didn’t go?\\xa0 Go ahead, and then I’ll do you second.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Your response to that question was —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 You mentioned Gavin Newsom —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Your response to that question earlier was that they shouldn’t be doing that.\\xa0 If they need something, we’ll — if they need them that badly —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0They shouldn’t be doing what?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Competing against each other.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 They shouldn’t be — the governors shouldn’t be competing with each for ventilators.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, they shouldn’t be competing.\\xa0 And they should call us.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, are you saying —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Wait.\\xa0 No, I don’t want them to compete because all they’re going to do is drive up the price.\\xa0 I don’t want them to compete.\\xa0 They should be calling us.\\xa0 And we can work it so they get the ventilators and they get shipped directly.\\n\\nIf they’re competing, if they’re calling — even if there’s only two of them calling, they’re going to just drive up the price.\\xa0 Because as nice as some of the people that do ventilators, they do want to make money.\\xa0 Okay?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you’re saying that you’re going to take (inaudible) overall?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Now, you know, New York had a chance to buy 16,000 ventilators.\\xa0 I guess they didn’t take that option.\\xa0 That was in 2016.\\xa0 And that’s a hard option to take because it’s a lot of money and who would ever think you need 16,000 ventilators?\\xa0 Who would ever think it?\\n\\nBut this is a very unique time in — in life.\\xa0 And I think — you know, I’m dealing with New York and we’re having a very good relationship.\\xa0 And you see what just happened in Central Park with the tents.\\xa0 I mean, we’re having a really good relationship.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 You didn’t get one.\\xa0 And then we’ll go to you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Gavin Newsom — you mentioned Gavin Newsom and the job that he’s doing.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I’m interested in what you think California has done to contribute to the suppression of the curve —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they’ve done a good job, California.\\xa0 Now, let’s see what happens because we could have a spike.\\xa0 Doctors — I mean, you don’t know.\\xa0 They could have a spike where, all the sudden, it spikes upward.\\n\\nWe had a couple — like Louisiana.\\xa0 I think they’re doing a really good job, but they had nothing.\\xa0 Now, they had Mardi Gras and then, all of a sudden, after Mardi Gras — which tells you about distancing, I guess.\\xa0 I mean, it’s a — it’s an example of what could happen.\\xa0 But they were like flawless.\\n\\nI was always surprised.\\xa0 I was looking at Louisiana.\\xa0 And I understand that state.\\xa0 I love that state.\\xa0 And I’m saying, “They’re in great shape.”\\xa0 Then they have Mardi Gras.\\xa0 It was a big success, tremendous success.\\xa0 And then, all of a sudden, it went like a rocket ship.\\xa0 So that tells you about distancing.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you concerned, though, about the homeless population in California because I know California officials think that it could spread like wildfire.\\xa0 And obviously there’s a homeless —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Say it again.\\xa0 Louder.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There’s a homelessness crisis in California.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, there is.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 They’re obviously concerned that it could spread like wildfire in that community.\\xa0 So is there anything the administration is doing?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, they’re looking at that very strongly.\\xa0 And I know that it’s — it bothers Gavin.\\xa0 I don’t know if it bothers Nancy Pelosi, but she’s got it in her district at a very high level.\\n\\nThey have to be very careful.\\xa0 They have a very big homeless population in an area which, just a few years ago, didn’t have anybody in those areas.\\xa0 And they’re living in the streets.\\n\\nAnd they’re — I know that some people in California are working on that very hard.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, you spoke several times with Prime Minister Trudeau, President Macron.\\xa0 And at the end of last week, President Macron talked about an important initiative that you and him would launch.\\xa0 Any news on that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, we’re talking about something that will be very positive for the world if we do it.\\xa0 We’ll see if we do it or not.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What — what would it take?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I don’t want to talk — it’s — it’s a private thing, but it will become public if we decide to do it, but positive.\\xa0 Our relationship with the President, our relationship with France is, you know, I think extraordinary, very good, probably as good as it’s ever been.\\n\\nJim.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Back to your comments about what could have happened and — and the actions that you took.\\xa0 Is there any fairness to the criticism that you may have lulled Americans into a false sense of security —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — when you were saying things like, “It’s going to go away” —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, it is.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — and that sort of thing.\\xa0 But —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Jim, it’s going away.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But when you were saying it was going to go away —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It’s going to go away, hopefully at the end of the month.\\xa0 And, if not, hopefully it will be soon after that.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But hasn’t your thinking on this evolved?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, it is going — Jim, it is going away.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Hasn’t your thinking on this evolved?\\xa0 You’re taking this more seriously now.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think, from the beginning, my attitude was that we have to give this country — I know how bad it was.\\xa0 All you have to do is look at what was going on in China.\\xa0 It was devastation.\\xa0 And all you have — look at the numbers from China, those initial numbers coming out from China.\\n\\nBut, you know, I read an article today, which was very interesting.\\xa0 They say, “We wish President Trump would give more bad news.\\xa0 Give bad news.”\\xa0 I’m not about bad news.\\xa0 I want to give people hope.\\xa0 I want to give people a feeling that we all have a chance.\\xa0 I mean —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But my —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — when — when you saw — when you saw the numbers and when John and all of you saw those numbers — and you’re saying, “120,000 people?\\xa0 You mean, that’s good?”\\xa0 A hundred thousand dead people within a short period of time.\\xa0 I want to give people a feeling of hope.\\xa0 I could be very negative.\\xa0 I could say, “Wait a minute, those numbers are terrible.\\xa0 This is going to be horrible.”\\xa0 This is a horrible thing.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is it possible that people heard what you were saying —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Hey, Jim, this —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — last month and said, “Okay, let’s go to the beach, let’s go to the airport, let’s go down to Mardi Gras…”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, there were a lot of people —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “Let’s go do those things.”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 There were a lot of people that could have said that.\\xa0 We didn’t say that.\\xa0 Fortunately, I didn’t say that.\\xa0 And that was an alternative.\\xa0 We talked about it.\\xa0 That was always an alternative.\\xa0 That’s what I said.\\xa0 “Let it rip, let it ride.\\xa0 Do nothing.”\\xa0 And we could have had 2.2 million dead people, more than that, because I didn’t do that.\\n\\nAnd we did catch it early.\\xa0 And we stopped China really early, and we stopped Europe really early, because I saw what was happening.\\xa0 What — what happened is I stopped Italy, because Italy was really heavily infected.\\xa0 We started off with certain parts of Italy, then all of Italy, then we saw Spain.\\xa0 Then I said, “Stop Europe.\\xa0 Let’s stop Europe.\\xa0 We have to stop them from coming here.”\\xa0 Europe.\\xa0 I love Europe, but they were having problems.\\n\\nI don’t think anybody did a better job than that, especially when you see the 2.2, million number.\\xa0 And I hope we’re going to be substantially under the numbers that you’re looking at on the minimum side.\\xa0 Then I think we will have — hey, look, it’s still tremendous death.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You weren’t just hoping that it would dissipate, that this would disappear.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I want to be positive.\\xa0 I don’t want to be negative.\\xa0 I have to — I’m a positive person.\\xa0 Somebody said, “Oh, I wish he’d be more negative.”\\xa0 They literally have that; it’s in one of the wonderful newspapers today.\\xa0 “I wish he’d be more negative.”\\xa0 Well, this is really easy to be negative about.\\xa0 But I want to give people hope too.\\xa0 You know, I’m a cheerleader for the country.\\xa0 We’re going through the worst thing that the country has probably ever seen.\\n\\nLook, we had — the Civil War, we lost 600,000 people, right?\\xa0 Here’s the thing: Had we not done anything, we would have lost many times that.\\xa0 But we did something, and so it’s going to be, hopefully, way under that.\\xa0 But, you know, we lose more here potentially then you lose in World Wars as a country.\\xa0 So there’s nothing positive, there’s nothing great about it, but I want to give people in this country hope.\\xa0 I think it’s very important.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So you knew it was going to be this severe when you were saying, “This is under control” and —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I thought it could be.\\xa0 I knew everything.\\xa0 I knew it could be horrible and I knew it could be maybe good.\\xa0 Don’t forget, at that time, people didn’t know that much about it, even the experts.\\xa0 We were talking about it.\\xa0 We didn’t know where it was going.\\xa0 We saw China, but that was it.\\xa0 Maybe it would have stopped at China.\\xa0 We wish we could have killed it in China, but it didn’t happen.\\xa0 It started spreading to Europe.\\xa0 It started spreading here.\\xa0 It started spreading all over.\\n\\nBut — and I’m not blaming anybody.\\xa0 I’m just saying that we have an incredible thing.\\xa0 I think the people — our professionals, our military, our governors, our politicians — I think they’ve done an incredible job.\\xa0 I mean, with few exceptions, I think they’ve done an incredible job.\\xa0 But I don’t want to be a negative person.\\xa0 It’d be so much easier for me to come up and say, “We have bad news.\\xa0 We’re going to lose 220,000 people and it’s going to happen over the next few weeks.”\\n\\nAnd with that, I did start off by saying today, long before this question, I said, “This is going to be a rough two or three weeks.\\xa0 This is going to be one of the roughest two or three weeks we’ve ever had in our country.\\xa0 We’re going to lose thousands of people.”\\n\\nWhen I see 28, 29 people from the governor of New Jersey — 29 people.\\xa0 When you see 173 people died in New York yesterday — or whatever the number was; I think it was more than that.\\xa0 When you see the kind of numbers that we’re witnessing, we’ve never seen numbers like that.\\xa0 So, it’s easy to be negative.\\xa0 And then everybody can be negative, but I’m a cheerleader for our country and I want it to do a great job so the number can be kept — and I’ve always said it: I want as few a number of people to die as possible.\\xa0 And that’s all we’re working on.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I know you don’t — you don’t like the question, but are you now taking responsibility —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t mind the question.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you — do you mi- —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t mind the question.\\xa0 I think it’s actually —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you now taking responsibility for how things go from this point forward?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I think it’s not meant to be.\\xa0 Look, I know you well enough, so it’s not meant to be a fair question, but it is a fair question.\\xa0 I think we’ve done a fantastic job.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Actually, it’s meant to be a fair question.\\xa0 I —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, fine, I’ll — I’ll accept your word.\\xa0 Look, Jim, I think we’ve done a great job.\\xa0 We’re going to see how it comes out.\\xa0 But when you look at minimal numbers of 120,000 people, when you look at it could have been 2.2 million people died and more if we did nothing — if we just did nothing, it would’ve gone up and it would’ve come down.\\xa0 As per your statement, it would have been confined.\\xa0 It would have been a similar time, maybe even less time.\\xa0 It would have been violence like we’ve never seen in this country before.\\n\\nWe had great professionals, great military, really great governors and politicians.\\xa0 I cannot say enough about what’s going on.\\xa0 And as per what you said, I think we’re way ahead of schedule, in terms of numbers.\\xa0 I think.\\xa0 I hope.\\xa0 But if we can keep it under the minimum numbers, the country is doing — not me — the country has done a great job.\\xa0 But I think I’ve done a really good job of mobilizing.\\xa0 I think Mike Pence has been fantastic.\\xa0 I put him in charge of the task force.\\xa0 We have wonderful people on the task force, Jim.\\xa0 Wonderful people.\\n\\nThey’re — this man was working, literally — he had days where he didn’t go to bed.\\xa0 He didn’t go to sleep.\\xa0 He called — he went 24 hours and then started the next day.\\xa0 People don’t know the job he did.\\xa0 I didn’t even know he was that good of a manager, to be honest with you — Mike, okay?\\xa0 And, you know, you never know that about somebody until they’re tested under fire.\\xa0 But he saw it very early also.\\xa0 We both did.\\n\\nThey saw it very early.\\xa0 They knew pretty soon — they probably knew sooner than anybody because that’s what they study, that’s what they do.\\xa0 Must be a depressing business, right?\\xa0 Must be a little bit depressing, but they’ve — they’ve seen it all.\\n\\nGo ahead, John.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I ask Dr. Fauci a question about a headline that’s been running all day to get his perspective on it?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There is a professor from MIT, Dr. Fauci, who suggests that coronavirus can be carried on droplets a distance of 27 feet.\\xa0 Do you buy into that?\\xa0 And if that might be the case, does that suggest that current social distancing guidelines may need to be extended?\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 This could really be terribly misleading, John.\\xa0 What it was, was looking at the distance that droplets by — by speaking, by coughing, or sneezing.\\xa0 So if you go way back and go, “Achoo!”\\xa0 And go like that, you might get 27 feet.\\xa0 But — so when you see somebody do that, get out of the way.\\xa0 But that’s not practical.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 There are some people that can do that.\\xa0 I know people that can do that.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 That is not practical, John.\\xa0 I — I’m sorry, but I was disturbed by that report because that’s misleading.\\xa0 That means that, all of a sudden, the six-foot thing doesn’t work.\\xa0 That is a very, very robust vigorous “Achoo” sneeze.\\xa0 That’s what that is.\\xa0 And that’s not what we’re talking about.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Do you want to keep going?\\xa0 Should we keep going?\\xa0 I don’t mind.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 One more.\\xa0 I have one more, sir.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 All right, go ahead.\\xa0 How about over here?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I got a follow-up on the masks, sir.\\xa0 But, first, you had mentioned Franklin Graham earlier —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yes.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — talking to him.\\xa0 As you know, his father, Billy Graham, was a trusted spiritual advisor and friend to many presidents.\\xa0 A lot of your predecessors, in times of national emergency, reached out to pastors and other spiritual counselors.\\xa0 Have you done that during this national emergency?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I never say that, but Franklin Graham is somebody that’s very special.\\xa0 I have many very special people.\\xa0 And very many special — in the evangelical — evangelical Christian community.\\xa0 You can talk rabbis, you can talk a lot of — you know, I have tremendous support from religious leaders.\\xa0 And Franklin Graham, I just spoke to him today for an extended period of time.\\xa0 I told him what a fantastic job you’re doing.\\xa0 And he does this; he loves doing it.\\xa0 He loves helping people.\\xa0 And he loves Jesus — that, I can tell you.\\xa0 He loves Jesus.\\xa0 He’s a great gentleman.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Can I ask, on the masks, sir — on the — on the masks, maybe for the doctors?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The what?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 On the masks: Is the reason why there’s no CDC recommendation for the public to wear masks because they’re meant to save and preserve the masks for the medical workers, or is it because the virus is not primarily transmitted through the air?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So there was a reco- — the CDC does have recommendations on their website about masks that came to the task force several weeks ago, about if you’re infected wearing a mask, to protect others.\\xa0 And if you can’t, you’re working with someone who’s sick and you have to be that worker in the household — because remember we want people in the household being taken care of — that they should wear a mask.\\n\\nI know your question is broader than that, and it’s just being considered by the task force now about whether that recommendation that already exists, relevant to wearing masks, should be altered in any way.\\xa0 So it’s still under discussion.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And — and just about masks, you can get a mask, but you could also do — I mean, most people have scarves, and scarves are very good.\\xa0 And they can use a scarf.\\xa0 And we’re only talking about a limited period of time.\\n\\nBut — and it says in the recommendations, you can use — you can substitute a scarf for a mask.\\xa0 So if people feel that — and I think, you know, some people disagree with the mask for various reasons, and some people don’t.\\xa0 But you could wear a scarf.\\xa0 You can do the masks if it makes you feel better.\\xa0 We have no objection to it, and some people recommend it.\\n\\nLet’s go back — in the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You people never get tired.\\xa0 Look at you.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Never.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And they’re still good questions, actually.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, again, I’m looking at the cases around the world in Latin America, in the Middle East.\\xa0 And, still, you don’t want to impose a travel ban for these areas.\\xa0 In Brazil, for instance, the President Bolsonaro, he keeps on being very active with groups.\\xa0 Aren’t you afraid that what we’re doing here can be threatened by what —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You mean you people?\\xa0 You mean you people?\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Not here, but I mean the United States —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I mean, you’re pretty spread out already.\\xa0 I don’t have any more —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But you understand what I —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don’t think we’ll have press conferences anymore.\\xa0 But —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I understand what —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Look — look, we’re very careful, I’m very careful, personally.\\xa0 And —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But the travel ban — I mean, aren’t you afraid?\\xa0 Aren’t you —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We are looking at numerous countries as they get in a position.\\xa0 Brazil, as an example — you mentioned the President.\\xa0 Brazil had no problem until just a short time ago, and now they’re starting to get inflamed.\\xa0 And, yes, we are absolutely looking at a ban.\\n\\nThere are two other countries you mentioned.\\xa0 Iran already has a ban.\\xa0 They had, sort of, an automatic ban.\\xa0 In addition to that, they have a ban.\\xa0 So we’re looking at certain countries as they become hot.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You’re starting a new 30 days now.\\xa0 What are your plans?\\xa0 Are you going to stay in the White House?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I’ll be in the White House.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you going to travel at all, or are you shelter in place?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I doubt I’ll leave.\\xa0 I wanted to go to the opening of the — of the hospital in New York.\\xa0 And my people couldn’t even believe it, that I said it.\\xa0 But I did.\\xa0 I wanted to go.\\xa0 They didn’t want me to do it.\\xa0 The Secret Service didn’t want me to do it for — you know, for reasons.\\xa0 I wanted to go to the boat sailing into New York Harbor, but the governor did a good job of that, and the mayor of New York.\\n\\nSo, you know, I’d love to go out.\\xa0 But, no,\\xa0I’ll be in the White House.\\xa0 And it’s sort of like nerve center, control center.\\xa0 And I think it’s important — you know, look, you see what happened with Boris Johnson, you see what happened with others.\\xa0 I think it’s important that I remain healthy.\\xa0 I really do.\\xa0 So, for the most part, we’re staying here.\\xa0 I’ve cancelled many different events, and we’ll be staying here, for the most part.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, of Tom Frieden, the former director of the CDC, wrote an article the other day in which he said, what’s really needed here\\xa0— and he understands the work that the task force is doing — is an incident commander to really take command of where everything is going and how things are being coordinated.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We have it.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\xa0 We have it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is that something that could be useful in this particular instance?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 (Inaudible.)\\xa0 We have it.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 His name is Pete Gaynor.\\xa0 He’s the Administrator of FEMA.\\xa0 And when the President signed the national emergency declaration, he stood up the National Response Center at FEMA.\\xa0 And now, I can tell you, that when the White House Coronavirus Task Force meets, I’m at one end of the table, and Pete Gaynor and the whole FEMA team are by video conference at the other end of the table.\\n\\nAnd that’s where — whether it be the air bridge that’s literally bringing in millions of medical supplies from around the world, the thoughtful deployment of those supplies to hospitals, particularly with regard to ventilators,\\xa0 we’re working very closely.\\n\\nHHS is fully integrated at FEMA now.\\xa0 But because of the President’s decision to stand up a FEMA in the lead, we have a Coronavirus Task Force at the White House that’s bringing the President the very best health experts and recommendations from every agency.\\n\\nBut all the implementation, as we tell governors literally every day, is happening through FEMA.\\xa0 It’s going down to the states through FEMA, and state requests are coming up through regional administrators for FEMA and back to the White House for (inaudible).\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. Vice President, at the same time, we have 4,000 ventilators that are parked in a warehouse in New Jersey.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no.\\xa0 You’re wrong.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 No, no, but that — that was the case.\\xa0 We also have — we —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Excuse me,\\xa0we moved them out.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I understand.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 They could have had them a long time ago, but they didn’t need it.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But the question is — this happened.\\xa0 We also have people not knowing about the new Abbott testing facility or testing system.\\xa0 If there were an incident commander who was in charge of all of that and getting the word out, would that be useful?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 John, nobody knew about the new Abbott.\\xa0 It was just brought to life two weeks ago.\\xa0 They just came up with it.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s right.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 It was an invention that was just — so, nobody knew about it.\\xa0 Nobody knew you could even do it.\\xa0 They did an incredible job.\\xa0 Their scientists came up with the idea a week and a half ago.\\xa0 I showed it to you yesterday in a box.\\xa0 I don’t think you could do much better than that.\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 If I may, Mr. President, I think your point is well taken.\\xa0 The Abbott Laboratories point-of-contact test was approved Friday.\\xa0 The President announced it in the Rose Garden on Sunday.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: \\xa0Should’ve done it (inaudible).\\n\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We’re socializing that all across the country to every governor, to laboratories elsewhere.\\xa0 And I have to tell you that this team that the President has assembled, the advisors on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, and then this team at FEMA — whether it be HHS Deputy Secretary Bob Kadlec, who’s coordinating all supplies; whether it be Admiral Giroir, who is literally working with every state on a county-by-county basis to deploy testing — is impressive.\\n\\nAnd I think it’s given great encouragement to governors.\\xa0 The President and I spoke to governors in all the states and territories again yesterday.\\xa0 Because governors — I can tell you from my own experience as a governor, in Indiana we had tornadoes and flooding.\\xa0 Governors know how to deal with FEMA.\\xa0 And as soon as the President stood up FEMA and declared that national emergency, what I’ll call a certain amount of muscle memory kicked in, in states around the country.\\xa0 And we’re really seeing a tremendous efficiency and communication.\\xa0 And that’s how we’re going to go forward.\\n\\nAgain, the President’s vision here is FEMA’s vision, which is in response to a health crisis.\\xa0 It’s locally executed, state managed, federally supported.\\xa0 And I have to tell you, we’re — we’re seeing that whole process spinning up every day.\\xa0 And I — I hope Americans looking on are encouraged by that system.\\xa0 And I know they’re hearing from governors around the country about the flow of resources and testing and supplies.\\xa0 And we’ll continue to keep that — what you call an incident command, what we call the Federal Emergency Management Agency — working 24/7.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And I have to say this: I’ve had, in the last less than a week, three governors call up that truly have disliked me over the years — even before I decided to run for President — and they said, “I have to tell you, you’ve done a great job.\\xa0 You and your team have done a great job.”\\xa0 These are three governors — respected — very respected in two cases.\\xa0 And they said, “Like or not like, you and your team have done an incredible job.”\\xa0 And I think they have.\\xa0 I think they’ve done an incredible job.\\n\\nGo ahead, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, thanks so much.\\xa0 My first question is on modeling.\\xa0 Was there any kind of White House modeling based on whether or not there would be a national lockdown or some sort of guidance to every single state that they needed to have lockdowns?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Sure.\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 So, I can — all of the modelers who presented did — I mean, I just want to thank them again because they assembled from around the globe very quickly, about two or three weeks ago, to — before we announced the first 15 days — to show all the implications of closing the schools, having people stay in their homes.\\xa0 And that’s how it was modeled: stay in your homes, social distancing of six feet.\\xa0 So, no one actually termed it a lockdown, as far as I remember.\\xa0 It was more about staying in your home.\\n\\nAnd I think the difference was — and these weren’t in the models.\\xa0 And I think when you talk about, “Could we have known something different?” — you know, I think all of us — I mean, I was overseas when this happened, in Africa.\\xa0 And I think when you looked at the China data originally, and you said, “Oh, well there’s 80 million people,” or 20 million people in Wuhan and 80 million people in Hubei, and they come up with a number of 50,000, you start thinking of this more like SARS than you do this kind of global pandemic.\\n\\nI mean, I’ll just be frank, that’s — when I looked at it I was like, “Oh, well, this is not…” — you know, as close as those quarters are, you know —\\n\\nSo I think the medical community made — interpreted the Chinese data as, that this was serious but smaller than anyone expected, because I think probably we were missing significant amount of the data, now that when we see what happened to Italy and we see what happened to Spain.\\n\\nAnd so what was modeled is not a lockdown.\\xa0 Two countries did remove people from homes that were positive and put them in separate spaces.\\xa0 That also wasn’t modeled.\\xa0 But it could be modeled.\\xa0 And so we could go back and ask the modelers about lockdown versus not lockdown, but what they modeled was people staying at home.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I guess what I was asking is, for best-case scenarios, since it says “best-case scenario is 100,000 people” — I know you’re trying to get that number even lower — but is best-case scenario every state basically having lockdown behavior, not maybe actual lockdowns but basically everyone staying in their homes?\\xa0 So if that’s — and if that’s true, why not tell every state to do that?\\n\\nDR. BIRX:\\xa0 It’s everybody social distancing by six feet when they’re outside.\\xa0 And that is probably absolutely the key, more than anything else, is if you’re never more than — if you’re never within six feet of any single individual, then you’ve controlled the virus.\\xa0 There are different methods to get you to that point.\\xa0 And I think what I’ve heard from our President and our Vice President is they trust the American people to understand that they can be outside, take walks, be six feet away from anyone else, and be in their homes, and we trust them to do that without having to lock down.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And then, Mr. President, a question on ventilators.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I just want — I just want to add, I think the one thing nobody really knew about this virus was how contagious it was.\\xa0 It’s so incredibly contagious.\\xa0 And nobody knew that.\\xa0 This is like — I don’t know that anybody has ever seen anything like this.\\xa0 Normally you’d have to get close and touch and this — a lot of things have to happen.\\xa0 This is just like — it’s — it’s truly invisible and so contagious.\\xa0 And I don’t think any doctor knew it at the time.\\xa0 I don’t think anybody could have known it.\\xa0 People have not seen anything like this.\\n\\nYeah, so go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A question about ventilators.\\xa0 You’ve talked about the fact that you don’t want to see states bidding against each other.\\xa0 The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, said that there should be a federal system where the federal government sets the price, the federal government distributes the ventilators.\\xa0 Why not have that type of a system?\\xa0 Why have this (inaudible) with states?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, essentially, we do.\\xa0 We’ve distributed thousands of ventilators.\\xa0 And we have now thousands of ventilators, and we’re buying them at a good price.\\xa0 And we’re actually making them by the thousands.\\xa0 We’re making them — you saw yesterday where Ford is going to have a tremendous number.\\xa0 They’re looking to make 100,000 ventilators.\\n\\nFord has been great.\\xa0 General Electric Healthcare has been great.\\xa0 General Motors has come a long way.\\xa0 I have to be honest, they were working very hard.\\xa0 We’re making thousands and thousands of ventilators.\\n\\nYou know, at the end of this — and there will be — don’t say I’m optimistic, because I don’t want to, you know — I wouldn’t want to do that.\\xa0 But I am optimistic.\\xa0 I’m a very optimistic person.\\n\\nLet me tell you, we will have thousands of ventilators.\\xa0 And what I want to do is make sure that we always have plenty for the future.\\xa0 But then we want to help Italy and France, and other countries that you don’t even know about yet, with all of the problems they have, because ventilators are very tough to come by.\\xa0 They’re very hard to make.\\xa0 They’re very complicated.\\xa0 They’re very expensive.\\n\\nYeah, please.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you, sir —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is Governor Cuomo mistaken then?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You can — you can go ahead.\\xa0 Go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is Governor Cuomo mistaken when he’s saying that he wants to see this federal system?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I don’t know.\\xa0 You know, I can’t take your interpretation of what he said.\\xa0 I don’t know what he said.\\xa0 I think he’s been reasonably generous, considering he’s a Democrat and I think he’d like to run for President.\\xa0 So I think he’s been pretty generous under those circumstances.\\xa0 But he’s been very generous to me.\\n\\nLook, I got him ships, I got hospitals, I got him a lot of things that he never thought — he had paydirt.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 And I’ve been very generous on ventilators.\\n\\nIf you look, they had 2,000 and 4,000.\\xa0 They had thousands of ventilators in his warehouse, in their warehouse, waiting to be picked up.\\xa0 They never picked them up.\\n\\nSo, I’d have to hear it from him, face-to-face.\\n\\nDo you want to add — how about one more and we’ll see you tomorrow?\\xa0 Is that okay?\\xa0 Don’t say that I cut it short.\\xa0 You’ll say he —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If you stay long enough, it’ll be tomorrow.\\xa0 (Laughs.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That’s right.\\xa0 It could be almost tomorrow.\\xa0 But you know what?\\xa0 In the meantime, I’m sure — I’m sure people are enjoying it.\\n\\nNo, it’s — I will say this: It’s an incredibly dark topic, an incredibly horrible topic, and it’s incredibly interesting.\\xa0 That’s why everybody is — it’s — they’re going crazy.\\xa0 They can’t get enough of it and they want to be careful.\\xa0 And I guess they’re studying it for themselves.\\xa0 They’re studying if they get it.\\xa0 A lot of people have it.\\xa0 A lot of people are positive, and they hope for the best.\\xa0 Because when this gets the wrong person, meaning a person that qualifies, generally speaking, on the list, it is ravaging.\\xa0 It is horrible.\\n\\nGo ahead.\\xa0 Well, how about you?\\xa0 In the back.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Is there any data to suggest that you’re going to see a second wave at the point at which these stay-at-home orders, these lockdowns —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, if we do see a second wave — because I’ve heard Dr. Fauci answer this question — if we do, we’re going to be, I think, very well prepared.\\xa0 And the second wave won’t be like the first wave.\\n\\nAnd with that, I better let him give you a little bit more to that answer because I don’t want to have him upset with me and say, “I wish you would have answered that question.”\\n\\nCome on, Doctor.\\n\\nDR. FAUCI:\\xa0 So, when you talk about second wave, I think you really are talking about to two different things that are a little bit different.\\n\\nSo, for example, after the 30 days, if we get the mitigation that we hope will get us to the suppression that Dr. Birx was talking about, there’s a danger, if we don’t continue to maintain that, that we will have a resurgence right within the current outbreak.\\xa0 That’s sort of a second wave, but it really is a exacerbation of the current wave.\\xa0 We hope that doesn’t happen, and that’s why we’re really pushing and why I was so emphatic about making sure we abide by those mitigation strategies.\\n\\nThe other aspect of a second wave is something that’s just the nature of a virus that’s, as the President said, highly transmissible and is going to be circulating in other parts of the world, as we’re going down — which I think we will and I feel certain that we will.\\n\\nThen we have to worry about the next season.\\xa0 And as was just mentioned, that’s when you use the experience that you have, the interventions that you’ve developed, and hopefully a vaccine that you’ll be able to deploy as quickly as you possibly can.\\n\\nThat’s that second wave that really is more seasonal than an exacerbation of something that you pull back on.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And a lot of — a lot of very positive things are happening with the therapeutics and drugs of different kinds and the vaccines.\\xa0 I think a lot of very positive things are happening.\\n\\nOkay.\\xa0 One more.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Please, go ahead.\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 So, under some of the worst-case scenarios, there is a real scarcity problem if you’ve given out, say, 7,000 ventilators and we got 10,000 around.\\xa0 So I’m just curious, who is — who signs off on those life and death decisions before GM and Ford ramp up?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I would say —\\n\\nQ\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Who’s going to sign off on that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 — Mike Pence, myself, the head of FEMA, some of our generals that are working, that are doing an unbelievable — you know, we have generals that are working that are unbelievable talents, unbelievable leaders.\\xa0 And it’ll go through one of three or four people, if it comes down to that.\\xa0 And I hope it doesn’t come down to that because I think we’re very well equipped.\\n\\nAnd it’s an honor to be here tonight.\\xa0 I appreciate it.\\xa0 I appreciate your interest.\\xa0 I think there is a great interest in it.\\xa0 And we’ll see you tomorrow.\\xa0 We’ll see you tomorrow.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\n\\nEND',\n",
