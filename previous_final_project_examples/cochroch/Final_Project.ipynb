    "### Why investigate the tweets about Democratic presidential candidates?\n",
    "I have always been interested in the ways that genders interacts with  politics. It is sometimes easy to ignore that gender plays a part in how we react to and think about politicians. Even though it has gotten much better over time, there is still more men in office than women, and there have been issues where women are more criticized for their looks and likability. Sexist pervades all areas of life and effects how we look at women who want to be in positions of leadership, in this case women who want to be the president of the United States. I wanted to see if tweets about the female and male candidates for president show a prejudice from the people tweeting about the candidates. Social media, especially Twitter is a platform for anyone who wants to be able to share their views. The Democratic primary was the perfect opportunity to investigate whether there was a phenomenon as there were multiple female and male candidates running for the same office."

    "I originally wanted to understand if there was a difference of the tweets about male and female candidates. I wanted to see what kinds of topics, words, and even attitudes were associated with the different genders. Through my investigation I found that female candidates are tweeted about as competitors for their male candidates, while male candidates are seen for more of their individual persons and policies. Now into the process of my investigation..."

    "I used the GetOldTweets method to get tweets from the month between the Iowa primaries which were on February 3, 2020 and when the last female candidate, Elizabeth Warren, ended her campaign on March 5, 2020. I collected by each week individually and I chose to use the queries with the twitter usernames of the candidates and the name that the candidate is referred to which is a part of their full name, so it will capture tweets with both the name they are known by and the full name. I chose to use the two most prominent male and female candidates at the time, Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. I removed the retweets from each corpus of tweets to make sure that I was getting only the original words of the twitter user."

The most interesting thing to me was the mention of other politicians in the corpuses which show comparison between two politicians. Biden's unigram list includes Bernie and Trump which show when people are talking about Biden, it includes references the current perceived largest competition for the candidate and future competition for the candidate. In Klobuchar's unigrams Biden, Bernie, Warren, and Buttigieg are mentioned which makes it evident that Klobuchar is often being compared to the other politicians in the Democratic primary. In the Sanders unigrams the only politician that is mentioned is 'trump' as Sanders was seen as a front runner during this time and potentially Trump's biggest competition. The politician mentioned in Warren's unigrams 'Bernie' which makes sense as she is often compared to the other progressive in the race which is Bernie Sanders. \n",

This shows how candidates' names are being used, showing that the female candidates are being used in tweets as one of many members in the race as compared to the males. This concept can be seen by the fact that the male candidates names in the female corpus are being used 8.2 times more than the female candidates names in the male corpus.\n",

Words to do with Biden's policy positions are gun, guns, war, children, and cages, which he clearly puts more focus on than other democrats in the race. Words that are associated with Bernie are socialism, free, communist, healthcare, establishment, capitalism, economy, wage, workers, mericare, income, #notmeus, and cuba. Having so many of these policy and ideology words for the male candidates shows that their individual ideas are being talked about on Twitter. \n",

The fact that Trump was used a lot with the male candidates more shows that they are being seen as a real competitor for the general election. It shows that certain serious topics are being talked about more in relation to males than females and that male candidates are being seen more as serious competitors."

For the female the words about general policy like 'bad' is being used more than the males.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on my investigation into the tweets about male and female political candidates over the month between the Iowa caucuses and Warren, the last female politician in the race, dropped out, male and female candidates are tweeted about differently. The unigram frequency lists of all of the candidates shows that female candidates are being talked about in conjunction with male candidates than male candidates being talked about with female candidates. The KWIC analysis showed that the way that tweets in both corpuses mention the candidates of the other gender have to with grouping candidates together, comparison between candidates, and horse race politics. These kinds of tweets are much more common in the female corpus since other candidates names are mentioned much more in the female tweets than male tweets. Therefore the female candidates are seen much more as a part of the group of democratic candidates and as a comparison for other candidates, as opposed to tweeting about the female candidates as their own person.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculate keyness function further confirmed how female candidates are being talked about in tweets. The words that were used for the females much more than the males included many politicians, some that had even dropped out of the race and some that were still in it. The use of the other candidates and it shows that female candidates are seen as a competitor for the office as opposed to male candidates. For males the keyness analysis pointed out many specific words to do with ideology and specific kinds of policy, which spoke to how the male candidates were being considered as individuals with their own ideas and plans for the office of President. The fact that Trump was used a lot with the male candidates in comparison to the female candidate shows that the males are being seen as a real competitor for the general election. The KWIC analysis on the word 'policy' showed how specific kinds of policy and policy in general were being mentioned in the tweets. The concordance analysis shows how specific words are being used in relation to the word policy and showed how male candidates specific policies are being talked about more than the females. Overall, from my analysis I think that women are being tweeted about an being seen more a part of the group of Democratic candidates as opposed to mean who are being seen less superficially and more for their ideology and policies."

    "## Future research\n",
    "In future exploration of this topic I would like to go into different congressional races and the past presidential races and primaries to see if this concept is consistent over time. I also want to related this more to the gender in the workplace and classroom realm and whether it is a part of the problem that women face everyday, that women face that they are seen more as a part of a group than for their individual accomplishments differently from their male counterparts. For future research I would also definitely want to see if this is true for woman in the world of sports, entertainment, and business."
